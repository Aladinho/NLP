Graphics-wise, it's the best game of this type I've seen or played - in terms of the puzzles, the comic book style introduction to each chapter, and the full-blown animation present at the beginning and end of the game as a whole.  Basically, you're helping a young couple - and the strange little ghost hunter who mysteriously turns up at their door - to find and trap the myriad of ghosts haunting their home.  Among all of the hidden objects you have to find across 30 unique rooms are the components the weird ghost hunter will use to trap the main spirits haunting each section.  You are also called upon to discover a number of lesser (and much more comical) spirits along the way.  The music and ambient sounds actually add to the experience, especially the dark ghostly chuckle you hear when you've found objects that will be used to trap a particular ghost.  Mishap also comes with as diverse a set of mini-games as you're likely to find in a game such as this - some are more enjoyable and challenging than others, but they are all optional for the player.  The game also comes with some extra features to make the whole experience a little more amusing - for every one of the pesky ghosts you're trapping, there's a funny story behind his/her demise.  Heck, the storyline of the game even throws in a surprise twist at the very end.I must admit, however, that I experienced some annoying technical problems that had a definite negative impact on my game experience.  After I completed the first two chapters, I was forced to endure a horrible and constant roar coming out of my speakers.  I could still make out the words and music on top of the sound, but it was a really annoying problem.  Sometimes it would clear itself up for a chapter ending or maybe even an entire chapter, but it always came back with a vengeance at some point.  I could find no problem with my sound settings, and reinstalling the game accomplished nothing in this regard.  That being the case, I have to lower my rating a little bit - but I still consider this a must-have item for hidden object game enthusiasts.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A fantastic game marred, at least in my case, by some technical problems", "unixReviewTime": 1297555200, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2011"}

The settings are visually interesting and animated and most of the mini-games at the end of each level are fun (though four or five rounds seemed excessive). There are little mini-mini-games in each level like solving a really easy to solve riddle and catching ghosts by moving your mouse around the screen (which is even easier than solving the too easy riddles). Still these little touches mix things up away from just object hunting.All the objects look like they should, meaning when it says find a cookie, it looks like a cookie. You aren't left wondering \"how is that a cookie?!\" The game doesn't allow you to randomly click all over the screen to find things, which is good. Otherwise, I'm sure I'd have done it at times. If you click too many areas that aren't objects, a ghost pops up and the screen fills with a green fog, making it even harder to find objects.The story is very basic. There's a haunted house. Various objects on the item list are used to form a machine that is used in the \"boss fight\" mini-games. Each of the four rooms in each of the eight levels has a letter or notebook or something to drop in some more story. I stopped caring about the story after a while. Each little scene between levels consisted of the ghost hunter guy telling you to go hunt more ghosts in another part of the house.

The story line is okay and there is a feature that allows you to skip it if it is too boring.  A couple things that would have improved this game: 1) the developers should have made the player how to combine and use objects, 2) the story parts that were like movies should have either moved along faster or had options to forward to the next scene (similar to the dialog boxes), and 3) a greater variety of mini-games would have been nice.

I'm belatedly noticing all the negative reviews posted for this product now... it took a LONG time to charge for the battery packs which I'm taking as a bad sign (like literally 8 hours ) , one battery pack works ok , the wii remote works fine with it and so forth and play tested it on wii games with no problem.. the other battery pack refuses to charge , red light indicator stays red instead of the blue \"done charging ! \" color ... and given one battery pack is ok and one isn't safe to assume that particular  battery pack is dead ... so you'd figure you'd contact memorex and hopefully they'd ship you a replacement battery pack right? WRONG.  The memorex cust.serv./tech.support rep was polite and all but basically had his hands tied by the company's policies.. your choice is to either mail the ENTIRE unit (charger, battery packs, cable, sensor bar) back for a complete refund or not.. that's it, they've discontinued this product (which seems VERY suspicious... too many negative customer complaints and lack of sales perhaps?)  so mailing out a replacement battery pack was not an option.. I didn't ask if they cover the postage for shipping and handling to mail it back to them since I purchased this at a low black friday sale price thank goodness... I think about the people who paid full price for this and I am wincing ... thank goodness amazon has fantastic customer service, hopefully they purchased it directly from amazon and can therefore more than likely send it back for a complete refund complete with pre-paid shipping/return label from amazon (yes I know I sound like an amazon commercial but my experience with these guys has been nothing but positive ;) )  .. then I did a google search online and was alarmed to see a report about memorex's product very similar to mine being recalled since the product apparently MELTS WHEN OVERHEATED ! .. do a google search for the words memorex recalls wii melting charger and you'll come up with a pc world article.. granted that was for units restricted to a store called Dick Smith up in Australia but still.. same manufacturer and product looks EXACTLY the same as what I bought, then when you consider what the sales rep said about Memorex discontinuing this product....I read a review online from a person who reviews these sorts of things for a living apparently, he says the included memorex wii remote sensor bar gives better performance than the \"default\" one that comes with the wii but big problem.. it's battery powered and there's an on/off switch.. more than likely the average gamer will forget to turn it off after use and you end up with the AAA batteries for the sensor bar drained before you know it.Final verdict... I GUESS if you're getting it for an extremely low price buy it and cross your fingers?.. I can't post how much I paid since the amazon review-bots edit any dollar figures out ... you can buy one, cross your fingers and hope for the best .. still with 1 out of 2 included battery packs working it's pretty annoying.. I would have been worse than annoyed if I'd paid full price for it.EDIT 2 ... well the other rechargeable battery that I thought was working died completely on me so that's zero for two .... now here's the strange thing.. I purchased two sets of these (two seperate memorex starter kit boxes basically) , was going to give one to a neighbor as a gift then I thought \" Geez I better check this out myself in case this one's a dud too \"... so I tested it.. batteries from that set are working just fine.  Judging from the mix of some positive and mostly negative reviews here I think it's pretty much a gamble... there's a chance the battery packs will work and there's a chance they will not , pretty much try your luck and see... I'd advise purchasing these only if they're selling at a REALLY low price, so low you don't mind throwing the money away in case you get a dud (or you're dealing with a seller who has a very generous return policy)EDIT 3 ... months after using even the rechargeable batteries that appear to be working properly - well  they've gone downhill from  there.  They hold a charge for a few hours of gameplay at best, are recharged after say 30 minutes of charging but then only hold a charge for 2 hours.. not nearly as effective as \"normal\" AA rechargeable batteries.  My final verdict is going to have to be avoid this at all cost no matter how enticing that low price they're charging for it is - they're putting this stuff on clearance sale prices for a reason and it's not because of the \"quality product but we've got too many of them\" syndrome.. more like \" these suck no one's buying them so slash prices and salvage what profit we can from it\".(ORIGINAL REVIEW BEFORE EDITS)Rapister thank you SO much for your review !  :)  It was incredibly helpful and informative and helped people like me who were \"on the fence\" about purchasing this.. I would like to add a few details in case there's any customers out there who are as dumb as me, rare I would think but possible :PI think there are different versions of the memorex wii starter kit .. I just assumed that I had the same version as Rapister but my kit includes a power cable without any adapter ... not sure but I think in Rapister's case memorex decided to be cheap and just give him  the adapter with no power cable and they were like \" meh, use your own wii power cable we're too lazy to give you one .. attach this adapter to it so you can plug it into your rechargable battery dock \" ... in my case since there's no power adapter I'm assuming that you just plug it into the dock and away you go so I did just that.. I will try to remember to update this review to let people know if my own worked ok far as recharging memorex batteries for wii and how well the wii remotes work with it but , as you can probably gather from this, DON'T go out and buy a seperate wii power cable without checking what's inside your box first in case it's already included  :P  .. my version says \" wii premium starter kit\" on the box , but there's no \"memorex wii premium starter kit\" with that exact name I can find on amazon ... looking up the model number on my box  is no help because it comes up with a charger set for FOUR wii controllers/batteries if you google search by the model name.. odd...Also my version comes with an on/off switch .. would have been nice if this had been mentioned in the instructions (it wasn't) , I spent a few minutes having a heart attack thinking my battery charging dock was dead on arrival before I finally saw the tiny, easy to miss on/off switch in the back :P  ...", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "addition to Rapister review (  DOA )", "unixReviewTime": 1355270400, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2012"}

I found it.It is not perfect, but its about 90% of what I am asking for. Let me explain...First, a bit of description. The package includes a leaflet with instructions, a power wire attachment, the charging cradle, and 2 battery packs. Everything's in white. The power wire attachment taps power from the Wii adapter, you cannot plug it directly to the mains (more on that later).It is the induction type charger, which means its wireless, you just need to pop the controller onto the cradle to charge. No need to worry about any metal contact points being in contact, or inserting something into the hole, or insert a USB port into wherever, you get the idea.To assemble, attach the cradle to the Wii power adapter with the attachment, and replace your AA batteries in the Wii controllers with the provided battery packs. That's it.There is a switch at the back where you flip to turn it on. It will glow blue. Place an uncharged controller on it. It will then glow red on the side of the uncharged controller. Nice. It then turns blue again when it is fully charged.As you well know, the Wii's controllers have so many possible configurations now... Wiimote, Wiimote Plus, Wiimote with additional motion add on, with silicon skin, with nunchuks plugged in, etc.I had these problems to solve:1. I am sick of changing the AA batteries. You need to peel out the silicon skin.2. I hate rechargeable AA batteries because that means I have to keep removing the batteries (see problem 1).3. I am sick of unplugging all the parts (Motion plus, silicon skin, nunchuk....) every time I want to charge the remote so that it fits in the charger.4. I need a charger that doesn't take up much space, as I have so many chargers... PS3, PS3 Move, DSi XL, handphone, PSP, other controllers etc.On a whim, I bought this product.How did it solve my problems?1. and 2. It provides a pair of battery packs which you never have to remove. You can cover your controller with the silicon skin and never have to peel it off to change batteries.3. This charges by induction/contactless. You just place the controller on the cradle, without the need to remove any parts of the Wiimote. Yes, it doesn't matter if you have the silicon skin, or whatever fancy straps, nunchuks, or add-ons you have. Well of course, you gotta take it out of the Zapper or light sabre or cookie cutter.4. This thing is flat and small. Looks great on my entertainment setup.Now for the bad points.You NEED TO PLUG IT TO THE BACK OF THE WII. How it gets its power is that it taps onto power from the Wii adapter before it reaches the console (plug it in between the power adapter and the console, they provide a little attachment for you to do that.) Hence it is powered by 12V DC. This is also written at the back of the cradle (12V 1 Amp).Well, that means it could only function when the Wii is turned on. What if you want to charge the controllers when you are not playing/Wii turned off? (obviously!)I tried to forgo the attachment thingy and connected the charger to a 12V DC adapter directly. Tried it for 2 days, the lights do glow, but the controllers did not charge, and thereafter there was a smell of burning electronics in the room. Yes, I fried my charger in 2 days. I DON'T KNOW WHY!I took it apart (it's easy, just remove 5 screws) and I smell fried electronics. A couple of solenoids and a couple of ICs inside. Can't fix it, so I tossed it, but kept the battery packs.So I bought a new one cos this thing is so convenient and pleasurable to use. Now I have 4 battery packs, which is great as I have 4 controllers anyway. I tried it with a different 12V DC adapter, and it started flashing like a madman, so I turned it off immediately. Seems like it works ONLY with the Wii power adapter and nothing else. I tried connecting the charger to the Wii adapter, with the Wii console totally disconnected, and it continues to charge. Bingo! So if you want to charge the controllers with the Wii off, you can do so with the Wii unplugged. But this is annoying, having to plug and unplug the power cord every time, so I decided to buy another Wii power adapter, so one power adapter powers the Wii, the other powers the charger. Problem solved.Thus this is the only complaint I have for this charger. Although I understand they are trying to minimise the number of wires coming out of your setup, I still hope they provide an option to charge from the mains directly in a future version maybe.I know this also comes in a 4 controller version right here at Amazon as well.It is quite a luxury item, being more costly than many other chargers in the market, but in the long run, it's really amazing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simply Amazing!", "unixReviewTime": 1291420800, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2010"}

The construction of the unit looks solid, perhaps even more than the Sony DS3.  The only strikes on this controller are: 1) the lack of sixaxis support; 2) it's wired and 3) the \"home\" button doesn't function like the PS3 button (it only functions when the console is already turned on so you cannot use it to turn the console on) - thus, the four-star rating.

{"reviewerID": "A331U01T7DMMHP", "asin": "B003G2Z4FK", "reviewerName": "Davidovich53", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "This controller worked great - at first.  Now it keeps turning itself off every 2 seconds.  It's been rendered unusable.  And before anyone asks, no I didn't drop it, throw it, slam it, get it wet, or expose it to harsh conditions.I'm now forced to go back to the default Sony controller, which is what I was trying to get away from in the first place.  The Nyko controller worked fine for about six months, and now it's \"bricked\" itself.  I know this controller was an aftermarket, \"budget\" product, but was I wrong to expect more from a manufacturer in the year 2012?My original review is as follows:The primary features on this controller are the L2/R2 buttons which give you just enough resistance to feel \"right\" when being pressed.  And they're in a concave shape (like the 360's controller) which prevent your fingers from accidentally slipping off.  If you're anything like me, you probably can't stand the mushy, imprecise, slippage-prone L2 and R2 buttons of the default Sony controller.The \"rightness\" also applies to the face buttons and select/start buttons, which feel springy and deliver a nice popping feel, giving good feedback with every press.  The body of the controller itself is ever so slightly bigger than Sony's, which allows for a more comfortable, natural-feeling grip.However, the L1 and R1 buttons by contrast feel flimsy.  The R1 button in particular has a tendency to get stuck in the \"pressed\" position, which actually does NOT affect performance: even when the button is stuck, my onscreen character doesn't actually fire his gun.  When I actually tap the button (in its stuck position), the added pressure on the button actually makes my guy fire.  This took a little time to get used to, but now I hardly notice it.Clicking the thumbsticks (the L3 and R3 functions) takes a lot more effort than on Sony's controller; you have to really, REALLY press hard to make them click.  After using the thumbsticks for a few days, though, it's become somewhat easier.  Same with the D-pad; you have to press down hard for the movement to register.  Tilting the sticks to move my character/pan the camera also takes some adjustment; in testing out this controller on Saints Row 3, I had to turn my camera sensitivity way down because it was simply too fast.  Most games allow you to adjust camera sensitivity, so this isn't too big of an issue.The fact this controller is wired may be a negative to some, but for me it's a positive because I don't have to keep buying batteries.  Another big drawback is that you can't use the \"home\" button on the controller to turn on your PS3; you have to hit the physical power button on your PS3, then hit the home button on the controller to sync it to the system.  Yes, you have to do this EVERY time you turn on your PS3.  It's a very minor step, but if your couch is very far away from your PS3, this could get annoying.  The controller has a nine-foot cable, with a Velcro strap to keep the cable rolled up if you don't need the entire nine feet (and let's face it, who would actually need all NINE feet?).Perhaps the biggest drawback is that this controller does NOT have SixAxis controls.  You read that right: if you want to play Heavy Rain or Flower, break out the default controller.I hope this review is useful (if a bit long!), with both the pros and the cons.

{"reviewerID": "A1NQ2AY8S778X8", "asin": "B003GB4UXI", "reviewerName": "Nerrel", "helpful": [3, 5], "reviewText": "The first Conduit was by no means a great game but it accomplished several things. It was a more unique experience than most modern shooters (even if it borrowed a lot from perfect dark), it had excellent weapon design, basic but fun online play, and most importantly a groundbreaking control scheme that raised the standard for pointer controls. High Voltage promised that the sequel would build on the good elements of the original while fixing the poor art direction, level design, and glitched multiplayer, and for the most part they succeeded in doing this. Unfortunately, even with these improvements the game still feels like an amateurish effort next to games from larger companies.The first problem with Conduit 2 is the control scheme. While the controls in the Conduit were excellent for the time, almost all wii shooters since from red steel 2 to goldeneye to numerous call of duty ports have surpassed it with more customization options and better physics. Rather than pushing remote customization further and raising the standard for customization again, High Voltage opted not to screw with the one thing they nailed the first time around and kept the scheme from the first game untouched. The option to use motion+ is there, but it hardly makes a difference unless you aim off screen constantly.There are no separate options for aiming down sights (making the addition of sights useless), no maximum turn zones, and even a few options from the first game, such as vertical view, are missing. The cursor is at least a little more steady this time around, but it is still more jittery than in other wii titles and the game still requires a lock on to keep the view stable. The controls are still workable, but they are not at all competitive with other recent wii games.The art direction has been majorly improved, and while it obviously doesn't reach the level of a first party Nintendo game the growth is still impressive. The scenery is usually interesting and varied enough to keep you from getting bored as often as in the original. However, so much of the visual design is lifted from other games that it's hard to give High Voltage too much credit for the work.  The Washington D.C. level features pulsing tentacles on the floors and walls that look cool for a moment until you realize that you saw the exact same pulsing tentacles four years ago in Metroid Corruption. So much of the visual design is stolen from elsewhere that the game still looks generic and uninspired, even if it is a lot prettier than last time.Level designs are improved greatly and offer much more freedom and choice than before. There is much more variety and the pacing is broken up by frequent real time events or boss fights. The bosses are not particularly memorable, but the inclusion of any boss fights at all feels like a godsend after the anticlimactic campaign of the first game. Some of the levels still stretch on for too long and there are dull spots that strongly resemble the low points of the first game (they make you play through the D.C. subway system... again... for the third time), but the level designs are much better overall this time around.For the single player levels the non-linearity is an absolute good, but for multiplayer the maps feel as if they've been forced to be as open as possible at the expense of gameplay. Most online maps are formless spaces with no real logic to their design. Paths travel aimlessly through the level, directing you nowhere in particular; the contrast is extremely clear when compared to goldeneye's brilliantly flowing and interlocking maps. Almost every map features constantly differing levels of height, forcing you to climb ladders and staircases over and over when you'd rather be fighting. Speaking of ladders, the game requires you to climb them by pointing the wii remote up or down, which is so awkward and unintuitive that you'll come to hate the mechanic within the first level. Ladders aside, the new maps are marginally better than the old ones, but even the best of them are just \"alright\".The weapons from the first game were a joy to use, and while all of them return this time, most of them have been balanced in ways that ruin what originally made them fun. The Deatomizer, for instance, was a semi auto laser in the first game that could be charged on the fly for a one hit kill. This time around it's a clumsy and weak machine gun, and charging it requires you to spend a second to switch to a different mode where you can't fire the weapon normally. Almost all of the new weapons, such as a black hole generator or District 9's magnet gun, are so gimmicky that they can't be practically used in battle. The weapons are at least more balanced with one another, but none of them are quite as solid in their feel as before.The leveling system is also a disappointment- it takes all of an hour or two to unlock whatever you want from the online \"store\". There is very little satisfaction or challenge in earning your new weapons because it takes almost no work to get there. The good news about the multiplayer is that splitscreen is included and even has a wave attack mode that's reasonably fun. It's not quite as engaging as the games that inspired it (nazi zombies, horde mode), but it's a nice small scale approximation for people who don't have those games.The story is another one of the few things the first game got right; it had surprisingly good acting, decent dialog, and it kept out of your way. This time around, high voltage takes a monumental step backwards by increasing the role of story in the game while simultaneously decreasing the quality of it. The voice acting and animation are terrible, with none of the original actors returning, and the dialog is just stupid. Sometimes the corniness of the story is deliberate and a lot of the in game banter is amusing, but the amount of forehead-slappingly bad scenes in the game makes you feel sorry for High Voltage. If watching the story unfold is like watching a fat girl losing her balance and flailing, the ending of the game is equivalent seeing her face plant firmly into the ground with a thunderous smack. You will laugh and remember the final scene for a good long while, but not for the reasons High Voltage intended.Conduit 2 is definitely a stronger game than the original, but it's not competing with the original game alone in a vacuum- there are plenty of other Wii shooters out there, and Conduit 2 feels very weak compared to almost any of them. Unlike the first Conduit, C2 borrows nearly all of its gameplay concepts from other games, such as call of duty, Metroid, and Halo, and the result is a game that feels generic, watered down and amateurish compared to its sources. High Voltage HAS to get credit for trying; it's clear that they poured their heart and soul into this game, and they continue to diligently support the players with patches and tweaks to the online play while other big name titles leave their playing communities high and dry. Unfortunately, for the second time High Voltage has proven that good intentions alone don't make a good game. They just don't have the resources to pull a good FPS off yet.I find it hard to recommend this game to anyone- if you hate call of duty and are looking for an alternative with fresh mechanics, you won't find it here. If you want a good science fiction themed shooter, choose Halo (or break out your n64 and go back to perfect dark). If you just want a straightforward, all around high quality FPS for your wii, choose Goldeneye. Any of these options are a better use of your time. Conduit 2 isn't such a bad game, but it simply isn't as good as anything else out there.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Double the disappointment", "unixReviewTime": 1321315200, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2011"}

Nevertheless, only a novice would allow this to prevent him from enjoying the game.THINK WHILE YOU SHOOT (NOBODY ELSE WILL)The creative level design more than makes up for what the graphics lack.

Controlling your character will take some tweaking of the Wii-Remote sensitivity but once you get the hang of it the fun begins.

I gave up on the game and sent it back for Goldeneye Wii instead and had fun with that. Even when I saw Conduit 2's AMAZING ending on youtube, which had Abraham Lincoln in a powered armor along with other former US presidents, couldn't force me to play through this unfinished and boring looking game.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Buy Goldeneye instead.", "unixReviewTime": 1306022400, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2011"}

Speaking of which, in multiplayer, you need to earn a certain number of experience points in order to upgrade to better weapons (the rocket launcher is really up there), and now there is an option for improved body armor.  Based on my experience last night, some people have already picked up some serious armor.The play is very fun, the visuals are improved, but perhaps not as smooth, the music is good, the voice overs in the standalone game are dreadfully terrible and I don't particularly care for the calling cries of downed players either.

It surpasses the first in every way, adding in some fantastic new features. But does it live up to the absurd amount of hype it was given?Yes it does.STORY - Conduit 2 has taken the story up a notch. Even though you may not have any idea of what's going on, this game will keep you interested and curious as to how all the pieces fit together. There are a lot of fun, exciting locations to visit as well. The ending is also really cool.The voice acting is completely different. The first one had some excellent voice acting, with a serious tone, while this one takes a comical approach. At first, I didn't like the cheesy, B-Movie feel to it, but as the game went on, I really started to like it. There were some parts that were pretty funny, too.Easter eggs are also all over in this game, and I was surprised to see some really neat references to movies and other games.CONTROLS - This is where the game gave me some trouble. The controls in this game aren't bad, but they do take some tweaking and some getting used to. The classic controller is really sensitive in this game and the wiimote and nunchuk has a different feel than the first game had. Not a game breaker, but definitely a game changer.GAMEPLAY - The gameplay is fantastic in Conduit 2. Enemy A.I. is challenging, enemy types are varied, every gun feels like a different animal, boss battles are epic, puzzles will keep you thinking, collectibles will keep you searching and the level designs are fresh, colorful and give you multiple ways to play through.The In-game Store - The store is very cool. It allows you to purchase weapons, upgrades, characters and pieces of armor that you can take with you into either the singleplayer campaign or the online multiplayer. It adds a lot of replayability to this game.GUN DESIGN - The BEST part of Conduit 2! The guns make this game something incredible. Every gun has a different feel to it, but all are very well balanced. And this is made sometimes painfully clear in multiplayer.MULTIPLAYER - Just when you thought the warp pistol was useless, or that heavy armor just slows you down too much, somebody else does amazingly well with it. Online multiplayer is done extremely well. The level designs are well balanced (unlike black ops), the guns are well balanced (unlike black ops), and the upgrades are so good, it makes you want to equip them all. The game modes are all fun. I couldn't find a single one I didn't like.Splitscreen multiplayer has all the competitive online game types, but throws in a coop mode called invasion. Invasion is a horde mode similar to firefight from Halo where you fight wave after wave of enemies. But, unlike Halo, you can beat invasion mode. It does take a while, though.This game may be my pick for the best first person shooter on the wii, but it does have some flaws. Even though this game plays incredibly smooth, the framerate does drop at times. The single player feels like it could be just a little bit longer. However, it is a satisfying experience. The game did freeze on me once, but only once. The biggest complaint I have is that invasion mode is splitscreen only. No online invasion. I don't know if they can add that later with downloadable content, but if they can, then I would gladly pay for it.Overall, Conduit 2 is a fantastic game that actually does compete with Xbox 360 and PS3 games (believe it or not). A 5 star game all the way, regardless of what other reviewers say about it. For some reason, IGN gave this game a lower score than its predecessor. Are they stupid? Don't ask me. Decide for yourself.

However, in the time since the release of The Conduit, the Wii really hasn't had much to compete with the original game. Now it's time for High Voltage Software to blow the doors off of their Wii FPS franchise. Needless to say, they don't just blow the doors off, they blow the entire building down.Positives:- An Epic Sci-Fi Adventure - The sci-fi feel, the level design, some of the enemies, etc., actually reminded me of Perfect Dark for the Nintendo 64. Conduit 2 melds classic FPS design with some of the newest mechanics, which creates a very cohesive feel.- Voice Acting - While I did enjoy the more serious conspiratorial tone of the prior game, Conduit 2 deploys Jon St. John to voice main character Michael Ford this time around. Adding an almost Duke Nukem-lite tone to the game, it's a welcomed addition. Sure, it may be cheesy, but it's also fun, and that's what gaming is all about. Get ready for the one-liners.- Boss Battles - Unlike The Conduit, Conduit 2 features a number of big boss battles that are exciting to play. They're not super frustrating, but just challenging enough to keep you on your toes.- Story - The story is fun and campy, but the hidden goodies are back to flesh out the narrative even more if you're willing to use your All-Seeing Eye device and find them.- Graphics - We all know that the Wii isn't a graphical power house, and you're not going to see HD resolutions here, however High Voltage Software has continued to improve their tech in Conduit 2. There are some pretty decent textures, reflective surfaces, decent lighting, etc. It won't amaze you, but it's well done considering the hardware it's running on.- Multiplayer - Deep, fun, engaging. Downloadable updates/patches from High Voltage Software. Splitscreen (Up to 4 players), Online (Up to 12 players). Voice Chat via the Headbanger headset. Free For All Modes: Deathmatch, Ballon Battle, ASE Ball, Bounty Hunter, Free For All CTF. Team Deathmatch Modes: Team Deathmatch, Shared Stock. Team Objective Modes: Capture the Flag, Killing Override, Single Flag CTF, VIP, ASE Basketball, Annexation, Power Surge. This is the Wii's premier online FPS.Negatives:- Minor Technical Issues - The framerate will sometimes dip, there are some bugs here and there, and there's some other unpolished aspects such as some poor lip sync for some characters.Conduit 2 is a huge step up from The Conduit. It may change the tone to a more silly and over-the-top nature, but it's fun in its own way. I can't say if I prefer the serious tone of The Conduit or the campy tone of Conduit 2, as they both do their own thing. I think it's nice that Conduit 2 is a bit different than The Conduit, so it feels somewhat fresh, yet it still keeps the things intact that made the first game solid, but just improves upon those things in nearly every single way.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An Excellent Addition to the Wii Library", "unixReviewTime": 1303430400, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2011"}

(You may or may not ask.) Well, firstly it's on the Wii...which isn't exactly the bastion of FPS games.  Secondly, Portal 2 and Crysis 2 were released within the same timeframe as this game and loom over the horizon with better hardware and bigger budgets.Does this prevent Conduit 2 from not being fun and extremely entertaining?  NO WAY!  Allow me to explain why....When The Conduit was released it was preceded with a nice media following due to the impressive screenshots and big claims in terms of gameplay.  It was to be the Wii's FPS killer app.  While it fell short of such promises due to High Voltage Software's emphasis on the game's engine development instead of level design, you could tell there was a lot of potential.  The Conduit had a robust online community and LOTS of customization aspects.  Conduit 2 carries over the insane amount of options for customization and control schemes to include the normal Wii Remote/Nunchuk duo, or Wii Motion Plus/Remote Plus, or the Classic Controller.  It also has, what seemed to me during my limited time online, a pretty good online community thus far.The graphics are more impressive than its predecessor and really stand out for a Wii title striving for realism.  What is of special note is the amount of locales in the game.  Rather than being stuck solely in the DC Metro area as in The Conduit, Conduit 2 runs the gamut of transporting the protaganist, Michael Ford, to great looking locations such as oil rigs, to Atlantis, jungles areas and various urban areas to name a few.  Additionally, enemy AI is more dynamic, although not perfect, compared to the first title.The story's just as campy and B-movie'ish as the original.  You gotta love it!  It, along with the goofy dialog and quips Ford makes during the game make it stand out from other FPS titles.  I think High Voltage Software realizes this game is an underdog in the FPS world and really made an attempt to make it unique with the dialog in the script.  The goofy sense of humor is awesome and really adds some charm to the game that really has no chance against the technical achievements of, oh say, Rage, Killzone 3, Crysis 2, et cetera.  I really stands out made the game pretty memorable for me.In the end, while the game doesn't stand out for its technical achievements the dialog and campiness more than makes up for it and makes the Conduit 2 quite a memorable game.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "\"Andromeda is a stone cold fox!\"", "unixReviewTime": 1304553600, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2011"}

She enjoyedNickelodeon Dancefor a long time but there aren't many songs on there and she's sort of into more popular music now, so she grew bored of it.So I ordered both Kidz Bop Dance Party andJust Dance Kids 2- she played both for a while and she *clearly* prefers Kidz Bop over Just Dance. While Just Dance is sort of videos of kids dancing in different costumes, Kidz Bop is fully animated, and you can \"dress up\" the character you choose, which is a *big* draw for my daughter. Also, the game seems a little more structured, as opposed to \"pick a song and dance to it\" which Just Dance seems to be.We haven't played the games long enough to be able to give a good report on the responsiveness of one over the other, but my daughter is definitely more interested in Kidz Bop. There's just more for her to do in that game, and the points system (earning points by dancing which you can use to buy accessories and things) really motivates her. Plus, the songs are a little better and the dances are a little more modern.I guess it's really up to the individual kids.

After all, it and We Cheer fell off the same Namco family tree: this is just an American version ofHappy Dance Collection [Japan Import], a Namco game that was only released in Japan.  You could even call this \"We Cheer Junior\".Gameplay is the same: pick a tune and dance along with the avatar while moving your remote along the tracks of arrows.  This game only uses one remote, and the dancing isn't as complex as We Cheer's, but I still work up a sweat.  The 24 songs are mainly pop tunes by the Kidz Bop singers; as cover versions go, you could do a lot worse (e.g. DDR Hottest Party) and kid tunes like Chicken Noodle Soup and Ice Cream & Guacamole, are catchy and fun for all ages.This is a better party game than We Cheer because it offers a guest mode, so guests can jump right in without having to create a file.  In Free Play mode, all the songs are unlocked from the beginning.  The Challenge mode is nice and simple, as challenge modes in dance games ought to be.  No epic battles or puzzle-solving, just progress along a trail of stars.  You win points to spend on clothes and accessories in a virtual shop, again like We Cheer.I thought it was overpriced when it came out, but for $20 or less it's a great deal.

They will try a game play for a short period of time then return to a game of Barbie or coloring!However, as they both like music and dancing, and are fans of some of the artists whose songs are featured in this game, I decided to sell my Disney Dance revolution which they could not care less about and replace it with this! It was a good move!I noticed a lot of reviews noted that it was similar to the just Dance series - I have not tried this so cannot compare, however my main goal was to get a fun game that my kids would like and this particular format resonated with them in terms of tracks and ease of play.The first thing that struck me was the fact that is was easier for younger children - granted we started with some of the easier dances, but some other games on the market which require kids to follow along may be too fast or complex for younger kids and kids will get frustrated when they cannot follow along or see some success. My 7 year old was able to dance along and readily score points as she mastered some of the moves. It was simple to understand and the graphics provides a good guide as to what move to do!Also, another important factor - the game and the Wii remote pair well together and the game picks up on the remote action. Nothing is more annoying when you are moving correctly but there is a disconnect between the game and the remote - this was not a factor at all in this game.The songs are fun and mostly contemporary - Thriller of course is a little more dated, but has the fun theme dance and is such a classic that even my toddler recognized it and played along. The songs have been adapted to make them age appropriate. The version we had also came with a bonus CD which was perhaps the weakest part as I did not recognize a lot of the songs and neither did my kids!The game has plenty of different modes, we have only tried solo play to date my there is an option to play against a friend, plus little girls will love the dress up, customize and shop sections which are added benefits!Of all the kids dance games for the Wii, this is my favorite  - simply because the ease of play and remote responsiveness, combined with a fun and modern sound track help keep younger kids engaged and it is a game in which they can have fun without the frustration of complex moves or rules.

An FPS that goes forward with a huge emphasis on story and atmosphere. The first three games made this evidently clear and thankfully Day 1 studios continues this tradition, for the most part.F.E.A.R. 3 is easily the best looking and performing of this franchise. It sports a revamped engine, improved enemy A.I., an array of unique co-op and multiplayer modes([...] run is awesome), and the return of the everyones favorite homicidal cannibal in gaming, Fettle. Also the gameplay has been tweaked to near perfection and is easily the best improvement made to the trilogy. However, despite the myriad improvements Day 1 has made to F.E.A.R. 3 , the game is uneven. The creepy atmosphere the game creates is marvelous but is completely under used, instead the majority of the game is spent moving from decimated cities, an erie neighborhood, military checkpoints, etc. Even with the unique gameplay and atmosphere, F.E.A.R. 3 falls short due to much of an emphasis on shooting and not enough on story/atmosphere.Basically, you(the player) spend less than 1/5 of the game in its madness.While F.E.A.R. 3 stands apart from the rest of the FPS market, it ain't no call of duty clone, it could have done more in terms of story and that is my biggest complaint.

This would be like the adult version of the series cause there are less things that scare but there is alot more things done right. From the first title you saw the weak game engine, the firefights were intense but are less and less as the game progressed. The second titles extraction point and persus mandate (FEAR FILES FOR THE REST OF YOU) were short filler games that were suppose to lead up to FEAR 2 but somehow lost there way. And FEAR 2 was the turning point in the series cause it showed how to do it right. Just enough scare to keep you wondering what's around the next corner. And last FEAR 3 the RACE to stop mommy from giving birth. So this game is fast and quick paced to reach the end of the story. And what a story if you play from FEAR 1- FEAR 3 with all the titles in between and you will see the growth of this series. And why the dev's went with this 'style' of gameplay.

However, the game shines when it comes to the co-op mode. In co-op the game allows the second player to be Paxton Fettel, he plays very differently from the Pointman, using his psychic abilities and mind control techniques against his enemies. He brings in a more dynamic strategy to the combat, he can restrain enemies in the air allowing the Pointman to get an easy shot, he can take control of soldiers allowing him access to their artillery providing fire support for Pointman, and finally he has the ability to give Pointman a shield barrier that makes him more damage resistant in combat. In other words, Paxton is the perfect wingman in combat, his abilities allow for many combat options for the player, whether they want to assist the Pointman from afar with the shielding and levitation powers or possessing a soldier and fighting alongside the Pointman on the frontlines. Whatever character the player chooses to be, the campaign is very fun with two people. The story is hazey at first, but begins to clear up the further you get. The campaign is filled with intense firefights and awesome cut scenes that will leave you saying, \"Holy $#&%!\" The downside is that the campaign is very short, it will not take you very long at all to beat it. Also, and regretfully it is not as terrifying as the last two games, which is a little disappointing.Multiplayer:The game offers two competetive and two co-op modes which offer hours of fun.

I am strictly a solo campaign player.FEAR has never been one of my top priorities. I was fairly excited for the first one, because about a year or so prior to its release there was a very long demo video that showcased some incredible combat and enemy AI. Those have always been the series' strong suit. Likewise, the FEAR franchise has always seemed to go out of its way to have very dull and mundane level design. The first FEAR took place almost exclusively in office buildings and industrial concrete basements. FEAR 2 \"really shook things up\" by adding a couple of ruined city streets and an elementary school. And now F3AR (ugh) has made the wonderful contribution of a megastore (a la Costco) and some suburban homes. Be still, my foolish heart. All in all I thought it was a step down from FEAR 2's level design.The combat, for the most part, remains as fun as ever. But it was the same 'ol same ol'. 90% of the time you're up against wily commandos intent on taking you down, or insane civilians who might as well have been zombies lifted straight out of Left 4 Dead. Occasionally you'll have to face a mech walker or a helicopter or two. The worst sequences of the game were those in which you had to face a swarm of leaping feral monsters, I was never really clear on where they came from or what they had to do with anything. It's possible the story explained it, but if so I missed it. Not that I mind. The story and the \"horror factor\" in FEAR have always been very minimal and completely beside the point as far as I'm concerned.All in all, I was ready for this game to be over before I actually reached the end.

It is not a very scary game but as a shooter action game it succeeds in being fun and challenging. They do a good job in mixing up enemy types, which keeps the action fresh. The enemy soldiers flank and lay cover fire and press you if you stay in cover too long. Most of the other enemy types just rush at you but sheer numbers make these enemies challenging.Story wise I have been entertained I did not play either the 1st or 2nd game so not sure if the story meshes with what was already laid out but on its own the story is above average for a FPS these days.I was pleasantly surprised by the graphics in this game. Seeing some vids online made the graphics look pretty bad. The graphics are not the best out there but the gameplay makes up for any lack of visuals and that's really what matters. The settings are fairly detailed and varied.  There are no epic set pieces but good settings and level design are present at every part of this game.The multiplayer in this game is awesome and there are some fresh modes with two small problems. I have played Soul King, F'N Run, and Contractions modes. I have not yet played Soul Survivor. Soul King is my favorite of these modes Basically 4 players start as specters and than the map populates with AI controlled bots as a specter you possess one of the bots and kill other bots once they die you collect the dead bots soul the other players do this too and to really win you have to kill the other players than they drop their collected souls. If you are the \"soul king\" the person with the most souls all the other players can see where you are on the map at all times. The game is fast frenetic fresh and very fun. F'N Run is fun as well a wall of death smoke is coming up behind you as you and a team of up to four players plow through enemy bots. It is awesome to turn around and see this smoke coming up fast behind you that will kill you but some maps require jumping over obstacles which is unfairly too hard and not always responsive. Contractions is basically a Fear 3 take on Nazi zombies from COD but you have to go out and get supplies between or at the end of rounds.Now for the problems with multiplayer, The lobby system and matchmaking leave a lot to be desired. You can host a match but unless you have a party of people set to go you can sit there for a while, before your game populates. You can join already hosted match but the host has to launch the game so sometimes you'll join a match and there will not be enough people for the host to launch the game and also sometimes it is a full lobby but the host has fallen asleep at the wheel and doesn't launch the game than you go back to square one. Also as I mentioned earlier Soul King is my fav mode so far but I have yet to have a full party complete a game. Usually 2 people quit by the end of round one, leaving me with one other person. Than if the host quits game ends. Needless to say the way this is set up I spend more time trying to get into a multiplayer game than actually playing the multiplayer.The multiplayer and graphics were good surprises after purchasing this game. Also the campaign co-op makes this game a package well worth a purchase. If you have a lot of friends who bought this game you wont have any of the issues I had with matchmaking but that is a small issue overall for me.

{"reviewerID": "A30IP5D5DLHRPA", "asin": "B003GSZ9ZE", "reviewerName": "Kyle Slayzar", "helpful": [6, 10], "reviewText": "The first FEAR title became known as one of the quintessential scary titles for the XBOX 360 when it came out back in 2006 a year after similarly freaky game Condemned: Criminal Origins.  With the flashlight being the only source of light for the vast majority of the game and the eerie backdrop, FEAR became one hell of a freaky title that ranked VERY high on my scare-the-crap-o'-meter.  FEAR 2 and FEAR Files were equally freaky with the ending in the second installment forcing me to wake up every night screaming for two weeks for fear I unwittingly made Alma pregnant with her next 'child.'With all that in mind I expected FEAR 3, the alleged ending to the franchise, to answer all questions, finish well, and scare the excrement out of me in the process.  After having beaten the game in under five hours and playing a little bit of the co-op and multiplayer I find myself shaking my head in disbelief that I paid full price for this severe letdown.Let us begin.Yes, you read correctly; I beat the game under five hours.  I thought the end-boss on the end-level was a lead-up to one final showdown with Alma, the main protagonist of the series, given how the story was finally beginning to progress.*in best Bill Lumberg impression*Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah... about that memo.When I got the achievement after beating a VERY easy final boss I was in complete disbelief that I had already completed the campaign mode (bleep bloop?).  The campaign felt like a long campaign from Left 4 Dead 2 than the usual 6-12 hours that first-person shooters typically run.  I was then treated to a very brief ending that was closer to a cut-scene where your score is put against your partner in order to determine what very short ending you would be treated to.  If you scored more points as the \"Point Man\" protagonist you get his ending whereas, concurrently, if you score more points as the other 'hero' Paxton Fettel you get his ending.  How cute.It wasn't as though the ending solved all the questions of the overall story arc either, even with both endings.  The ending made me raise my eyebrow and simply give off a four-worded response: \"No way in hell.\"  Two years of waiting for the conclusion and I get another non-ending that more-or-less opens it for a sequel.  It is this kind of BS that makes us gamers less inclined to get new titles opening night.  And the BS didn't end there.As mentioned earlier, FEAR 3 was not scary at all.  Perhaps I am desensitized by the exploding babies from Dead Space 2, an equally disappointing game, but there were no moments that were genuinely scary since most of the game took place during the daytime with lots of lighting.  In fact, the second mission took place in a VERY lit favella in a place that looked strikingly like a particular game mission in Rio di Janeiro (I bumped into \"Soap\" BTW, he says, \"Hi\").  I used the flashlight attachment less during FEAR 3 than I used ambient lighting in the first FEAR.Truth be told, FEAR 3 felt like an arcade shooter and, like Dead Space 2, a dramatic deviation from the previous installments.  This is not necessarily a bad thing as there were some redeeming aspects to FEAR 3.  The melee attack system proved very entertaining as, like Mortal Kombat, the foot sweep proved to be the bane of the existence of many an enemy in the game.  No BS, when I played through the game again as Fettel, I beat the first level on the \"fearless\" difficulty setting and only got hit five times as I spent literally the entire level utilizing foot sweeps.  They were virtually one-hit kills on most enemies.  I even had a blast with jump kicks (the jerks removed the roundhouse kicks from FEAR 2: Project Origins).  All the while I was whistling \"Kung Fu Fighting\" by Carl Douglas.  Yeah, the game was THAT easy.Another nice aspect was the utilizing of power armor, which made a small cameo in Project Origins.  You not only get one more chance to pilot the amazing piece of machinery but FOUR chances that are relatively long.  To make this nicer, the control schemes were virtually identical to the previous installments so it was pretty simple to get acclimated to playing the game.Lastly among my favorites was the co-op features.  This was what everyone got excited for and it's obvious that is where the vast majority of the emphasis went into.  It was well executed and balanced as the abilities of both Point Man and Fettel compliment each other (which only do so in co-op) as the latter can suspend enemies while the former guns them down.  My partners-in-crime online enjoyed this feature, and we tried doing the other multiplayer features that closely resembled Nazi Zombies and Left 4 Dead, but that didn't last very long.  We were hoping for a scary game, not an arcade shooter.In short, the game play was as solid as FEAR 2: Project Origins, but completely without the scary features.  Worthy of a rental or if the game seriously goes down in price.  I akin this game to Dead Space 2 albeit with the exploding infants.All in all, a 75%.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Left 4 FEARless 3: Mission Accomplished?", "unixReviewTime": 1308787200, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2011"}

In 2011, FEAR 3 teases a fraction of that AI and actually surprises gamers. We&#8217;re still not at 100%, and this raises the issue of why us gamers are more fascinated with fancy bump-mapping than playing with enemies who will out-do you by flanking and working together to cave your skull in.If you&#8217;re a fan of horror and FPS, FEAR 3 is a must-buy. It does not reach the high standard of 2005&#8217;s product however, but is probably better paced and executed than FEAR 2. Visuals range from great to poor; high-res to blotchy and watered down textures. There are lots of things happening all the time in FEAR 3, so when you&#8217;re not being attacked and engaged in battle, the supernatural is at work. It&#8217;s a very &#8220;busy&#8221; campaign.Score and ranking up plays a subtle importance. More points are awarded for using different weapons and methods. Even well-hidden dolls of Amy can be sought out for bonus points. It all feels very strange , even in a game which relies on strangeness; but feels oddly compelling. It encourages a repeat play with a second character, Fettel. Fettel is a psychic who has only melee weapons but can possess other NPC&#8217;s to progress through the same campaign, this gives the player around 12 hours of gameplay in total. Fortunately, it doesn&#8217;t seem overly long or tiring.Sound plays an important role here, even more so than the visuals. The score dictates the mood, and keeps you on the edge - or calms you right down, before jump-scaring you out of your comfort zone once again.Two missions make the player believe he's playing Left 4 Dead 2 - yes really. We&#8217;ve gone from the dark, weird and elaborate atmospheric setting to a silly, over-the-top black comedic one with (yes!) zombies who charge you with suicide vests. This experience feels disjointed and not part of FEAR. Thankfully, this is short lived - the game returns to its dark roots before long.There&#8217;s moments of frantic action which become tough and frustrating, more notably a few sections on the rooftops. Soldiers come in thick and fast, swearing like dockers as they become annihilated by the player in slow motion. There&#8217;s a solid boss battle or two to be had, and a section where you&#8217;re attacked by infinitely respawning demon dogs as you panic to close a shutter down (which, supposedly protects you from the fierce power of the dogs pounces).I admire FEAR 3 because it&#8217;s a title many people avoided, but I actually really enjoyed it for what it was.

When I say they are the BEST I mean it, the weapon and player control are unlike any game that I have ever played!! The cover control reminds me of a highly improved and polished Rainbow 6 Vegas contol scheme but smooth as ice.  You can run up to a crate or other obstacle and hit the leap button and slide right over the top, this is especially cool when you engage slow mode and are tearing up the enemies at the same time.The graphics are very good, probably a 4.5/5 and the gibbs...holy crap!! when you hit someone with a shotty as they come around a corner, you will not need to worry about them getting up since their body has just exploded in a mist of red rain.  The weapons are highly detailed and work like a champ, the grenades cook off a little quicker than I would like so you definately need to pay attention to the counter or you will join the enemies demise!AI, holy crap!! if they see you, they will call out your location to the rest of the team and they will come looking for you, no more standing behind a box and waiting for you! All you will hear is, \"there he is, he is hiding behind that box, take cover position, team 1 go in\"...and they always do.  If you do not use cover in this game, you will die very quickly since the health meeter seems to deplete in no time.Sound: FEAR at its best!! nothing like walking through the prison at the beginning of the game and having an inmate jump up through the viewing port in the door screaming at your and throwing various items out you.Overall this game is a highly polished work of art!!

The story has evolved into something nonsensical and this third chapter has lost any, if not all of the frights that the first one managed to gather. Does this make F.E.A.R. 3 a bad game? No, in fact it's far from being a bad game. I'd actually say that this is one of the best two-player co-op games you can currently get your hands on and it shouldn't be missed for those who enjoy progressing through a solid campaign experience with a buddy.If you've played the expansion pack for F.E.A.R. 2, then you will be familiar with Point Man, who is one of the two characters you can play as. The other is Paxton Fettel, cannibal psycho psychic dude who has been a series staple from the very beginning. Between the two of you, assuming that you're playing with someone else of course, you will team up to dish out some serious harm to your enemies. So much in fact that you're certain to attain a certain euphoria as you zip through levels decimating your enemies. And decimate them you do. There's something inherently satisfying about psychically suspending some dude in the air while your partner unloads a clip into him at close range, making him jiggle like some marionette. Or you can just make them explode outright in a fine mist of blood and gore. Point Man plays like a standard run and gun super soldier but Paxton adds a certain flair to the proceedings that makes things that much more fun. In the end, the game trades in it's well worn scare tactics for some solid co-op gameplay and it's a worthwhile trade.The game also offers some online multiplayer modes, the best of which in my humble opinion being the \"F***ing Run\" mode that puts you and three others in front of a wall of smoke that kills anyone who can't manage to stay ahead of it. It's incredibly intense and a lot of fun if you can find people online to play along with you.I like this game very much and it offers a significant amount of replay value for your dollar, which is one of the best compliments you can pay a game of this type.

Online is cool, but splitscreen is a blast. You play as pointman ( the silent protagonist of the first game, who can slow down time) and his deceased brother, whom he killed Fettel ( a morbidly amusing spectre that can use his ghostly abilities to levitate his enemies, setting them up to be shot by pointman, exploded in a cloud of gory awesome if you walk up to them and melee, or posessed and used as meat suits, giving Fettel all of pointmans abilities, sans time slow, until the meat suit dies, you run out of ghost juice, or you blow it up yourself, tee hee). You are trying to find your mother, a terrifyingly powerful psychic, who looks like a little girl, a naked woman, or a creepy pregnant woman after she raped the second games protagonist; don't ask, it doesn't matter.The story is superfluous. What does matter is the pitch perfect, lightning fast, gameplay that you and a friend will have a blast playing. Pointman and Fettel's individual abilities complement each other perfectly. When pointman slows down time, Fettel's melee becomes much more powerful. When Fettel levitates an enemy, they become a sitting duck for pointman to fill with holes. Fettel can also put a shield around pointman when things get hairy.While playing through the game, you will notice that you gain levels by performing in game challenges, like levitating ten enemies for your brother to shoot, getting fifteen melee kills, and shooting enemies from cover. Whoever plays better in the level is the \"favorite son\", and if they are the better player, the character they play as will get the ending.Now, take everything I have said, and cut the fun in half if you don't have anyone to play with. I'm not saying there is no fun to be had if you play this game solo, but it will not be the same experience. Only play this if you definitely have someone to play with.

Two brothers brought up in a sterile experimental facility observed at play, at sleep and at war. Okay got that. For some reason though one of them doesn't talk and both boys really don't look alike at all. I'd like to see the milkman as I'm pretty sure we're looking at two different dads here. But regardless of the confusing fable presented in Fear 3, no good game's success should fall on the shoulders of the story being told however lackluster it may be. I mean, did we really care who the Space Invaders were? Nahh.So what you have is a solid FPS. Not really much variety of weaponry, and since you can only carry two weapons at a time it makes sense to have a long range and a short range with you and the shotgun and three-burst semi do the job thorough out the game nicely. There's slow-mo bullet time fodder which isn't nearly as satisfying as I expected as most bad guys take loads of rounds and in some cases many reloads to fall and often don't drop before bullet time has drained. For example there's a particular type of glowing blue bad guy that even in the game's easiest setting, Recruit, takes an inordinate amount of lead to drop. It does get kind of old at times.The atmosphere is obviously something worked on long on hard by the devs and there's at least a couple of truly spine-tingling moments in Fear. Usually these scares weren't so much from the 'BOO!' gotchas but more from some naturally creepy surroundings and audio that have been nicely constructed to induce suitable 'wet my pants' moments.Each chapter, or interval, usually is based around a particular location; supermarket, airport, broken bridge etc although later chapters are much shorter than earlier ones and this resulted in a quick wrap-up feel to the game especially the final boss battle.One factor I do like is once done, you can begin the game from the point of view of Fettel the more vocal of the two brothers. Without spoiling things, Fettel's abilities are more supernatural than Point Man's and add a really refreshing slant to a subsequent play through. The single player campaign also has an RPG element with rewards such as extra health or new abilities being awarded based on your performance and those stats are carried through from one play through to the next. Anything that gives more replayability should be applauded.Obviously the game has been also heavily tuned for co-op which unfortunately along with MP I did not play.

Slo-mo is cool for a few minutes but quickly becomes boring - \"oh wow another slow mo headshot with blood spurting out in slow mo\".  Story line is non-existent.  The only fear elements are random blurry flashes of ghosts and creaky noises...yawn Resident Evil scares me more.  There really is no incentive to move quickly through the game, so don't be surprised if you spend 5 minutes crouching behind a wall to get the camping achievement.So basically it's a run around blurred most of the time, shoot everyone, watch blood splatter, and win type of game.  Buy it when its price drops to $15 or less.  Come to think of it, I agree with the review below me, it feels a lot like a CoD ripoff with slo mo added.PS - Only the machine gun is useful.

I seem to remember the same thing happening with Fear 2, but I think I actually liked that game better than Fear 1.  I'm not sure what it is, but Fear 2 and Fear 3 just seem to resonate with me more than Fear 1 did.  The graphics and gunplay of Fear 3 are both very good, and the story works for me (However, I did have a lot of questions at the beginning.  Be patient.  Your questions will be answered as the game progresses).Just as in Fear 1, you play as the point man.  Armacham has imprisoned you in a far off country, presumably to isolate you and prevent any further disruption of their fiendish plot.  I won't give away any spoilers, but all three games' stories come together gradually.  Wes Craven and Steve Niles were both hired to assist with the writing and story progression.  Whether or not their involvement had any real impact on the story is anyone's guess, but like I said, I'm enjoying the story.  It's not really that scary.  In fact, the entire Fear series has never really been that scary (Half-life 2 and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter actually made me jump more than these games did).As in Fear 2 I find the gunplay to be excellent.  Hit detection and animations are very good.  I like the look and feel of the weapons (although there really isn't a huge selection).  Finding ammo is sometimes an issue during large fire fights.  The cover system works very well and is a welcome addition.  We get to run around in mechs again!  Overall, the gunplay is the meat and potatoes of the game, and it works.Graphics remind me quite a bit of Fear 2.  The color palette is once again varied.  Fear 1 looked really drab and monochromatic.  Fear 2 introduced a lot of brighter colors, and Fear 3 looks very similar.  The game is supposed to support DX11, but I don't think it looks quite that detailed.  I've got everything turned up to max settings (I have a GTX 580, getting 60 fps).  At any rate, it still looks pretty good.  Again, I think it's comparable to Fear 2.If you're a Fear 1 purist, you might not like Fear 3.  Many complain that the game is consolized, and they may be right.  Regardless, if you enjoyed Fear 2, then you will most likely enjoy Fear 3.  I can't really find too many shortcomings other than the graphics don't really seam to be DX11 and the story can get a little convoluted at times.

When I played the original F.E.A.R., I was expecting a terrifying game that would chill me to the bone and quiver with fear. What I received was a repetitive shooter with the occasional moment of walking down a dark hallway and a trashcan knocking itself over. Needless to say I experienced more fear when I thought the condom broke.Enough about the previous games lets focus on F.3.A.R or as a normal person would type it: Fear 3. Fear 3 was developed by a different developer and it shows as the game has a different feel to it in the combat and pacing. While there are still those moments of walking through a creepy environment with scary sounds, fear 3 focuses mostly on the action this time. Many times during my playthrough people questioned whether or not I was playing Call of Duty due to some environments and gameplay looking damn near identical.If we look at this game as just being a shooter, the gameplay is fun and fast paced but there isn't much that is revolutionary or not seen before. You can only carry 2 weapons at a time which is not an issue due to there being lots and lots of ammo and enemies dropping guns. All the staples are here: assault rifle, shotgun, pistol, laser gun, missile launcher, sniper, and my favorite dual submachine guns. Each gun is fun to use and the game does a good job of cycling weapons so you get to play with all of them. Bullet time returns using the exact same mechanics of the first games.Fear 3 uses a cover system and regenerating health similar to mass effect in which you must hide until you regenerate your health. One of the oddest changes to the game are the removal of collectable health upgrades and the addition of a Call of Duty type of leveling system in which completing actions gain you experience that increase your \"rank\" or \"level\" even in single player. Each level has a different perk like \"increase your health by 10%\" or \"Maximum ammo increase.\"The storyline of the game revolves around Point Man and his brother Fettel getting to Alma (their mother) before she gives birth to the baby from the second game. During the journey we learn more about the past of Point Man and his brother and what the doctor did to them while they were living in project origin. Most of the storyline was very weird, sometimes hard to follow and disturbing but the cut scenes are effective at setting the mood. The cut scenes tell almost the entire story and are broken up with the action gameplay sequences. The ending is short, abrupt and weird and will leave you wanting more of a conclusion.If we look at FEAR 3 as a horror game, this is where the game is weak. Like the previous titles all the horror is condensed into the scenes in which you are walking around a creepy environment and waiting for something to scare you. There are a couple really well done sections that are very eerie, but these areas are few and far between and rarely ever make you jump.Overall, F.E.A.R. 3 is an above average shooter that is fun to play but it's hard to shake the feeling of disappointment with the lack of horror. If you are looking for a game to scare you or looking for a survival horror I suggest passing on this game as you will be disappointed. If you are a big fan of shooters like call of duty or the original fear games then you should have plenty of fun especially if you play the campaign with a friend in co-op.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Above Average Shooter, Mediocre Horror Game", "unixReviewTime": 1309392000, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2011"}

I bought the disc version because it was cheaper than the download, cost around $10 new, and I couldn't be happier.Yes, the game is a little different than the first and second FEAR's, but it still keeps the aspects that made the first ones awesome and improves upon many of them- two of which are being a great horror-FPS, and tons of blood and violence :). In the beginning, I was a bit nervous since there was just a ton of shooting and no bloody/horror scenes, but that quickly changed. This game does take you to creepy places similar to the The School level from FEAR 2 (my favorite level from that game, so creepy). I think the bulk-food store would be one of the best levels in this game, among others. You'll see what I mean...I love games like this because I grew up on Mario and the like, and the sooner developers realize that a generation has become adults now and that these type of games now have the audience out there to make money on, the better. If you have a friend out there that says 'video games are for kids', then show them the FEAR series, mostly 2 and 3. This game has some of the best greusomely violent scenes I've ever seen. Homes with blood all over the walls, Satanic symbols written on every inch. I'm not someone with a problem, it's just nice to see an adult game every now and then, not another Mario Cart that only makes money because there's more kid-gamers out there than adults.The aiming didn't seem as tight/responsive as the last 2 games, kind of made it hard at times to play through a scene without the slo-mo effect (which comes in handy). I didn't have v-sync on or anything like that, it just didn't seem perfect, but it was far from terrible, so even if you notice the same thing, it won't keep you from headshots at 30 feet. Also, there's not a ton of weapons, but there's enough. The game's length seems sufficient as well, definitely long enough to justify the price it is now. You can also play through again with Fettel, which isn't a COMPLETELY different experience, but different enough to keep another playthrough interesting.This installment goes deeper into the FEAR plot, taking place right after/around the same time as the second one.  This is a great game, you definitely should get it, and don't be fooled by the first daytime-shooting spree scene or two, because it does end up keeping the same violent/horror aspect that made the first 2 great.TIP- The graphics look great. It's a slightly demanding game if you plan on playing over 60fps. I always do (120hz monitor), and with GTX680 SLI, it shouldn't be a problem, but the framerate was dropping below 120fps even though usage wasn't hitting 100% on the 680s or the CPU. I found that a fix that was recommended for the first FEAR does indeed still work for FEAR 3, as well as a few other games surprisingly. If you have a wireless Logitech mouse/keyboard, as I do, go Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Device Manager, drop down the 'Human Interface Devices' tab, and right-click and disable all of the items in this list that your keyboard doesn't need for basic functions (sound adjustment through the keyboard and the backward/forward buttons on the mouse for website navigation might be disabled, but the basic mouse/keyboard functions should still work, otherwise enable the last HID-Compliant so that basic function is returned). The ones with 'mouse' or 'keyboard' right in the title are usually the ones for basic function, so, but you'll figure out all the ones you can safely disable. Just un-plug/plug back in the mouse/keyboard if you disable it altogether and it'll be back to normal and you can try again. Anyways, disabling all the HID-compliant things on the list that you can will smooth out the framerate if you're getting drops for no reason. I'm not sure why so many games have an issue with the Logitech wireless devices/drivers, but as another example, I was getting framerate drops into the 70s for no reason in Alan Wake, and I disabled a bunch of items in the Human Interface Devices list, and now the framerate is smooth and steady. So, just a quick fix that might help in FEAR as well as other games.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent game", "unixReviewTime": 1336694400, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2012"}

I played through all the other PC Fear games. (See my review of Fear 2). I am a huge fan of first person shooters going back to Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior and Redneck Rampage. Fear 3 has one big difference I don't like and I think it happens with games ported from game consoles to PC. The SAVE system is limited to the current segment beginning which can lead to some frustration playing through certain scenes many times until you get it figured out. The plot continues from the disaster following the nuclear detonation from the end of FEAR 1. FEAR 2 left us with a pregnant Alma and all the scary possibilities from that. Point Man encounters Fettel frequently along the way. He is helpful for some reason despite the rather obvious forehead bullet wound ministered by Point Man in an earlier game. The player can carry just two weapons which leads to the need to use good strategy in selection. FEAR 3 continues the \"bullet-time\" mode from the earlier FEAR games but it is of very short duration. I have only played Single Mission so far and I don't quite get the significance of Psychic Links. If you get enough of them you get power-ups along the way. Being STEAM, there is a long list of challenges. The fire fights can be quite interesting, especially when up against the, \"brain-fried freaks\", a cult of suicidal maniacs wielding hammers, hatchets, pipes and some wearing explosive vests. The usual enemies are ARMACHAM mercenaries or maybe they are Replicas as in Fear 1. We don't know. Fear 3 has a really unique element you will run up against, many would call them the \"bosses\". Phase Casters and Phase Commanders. They appear as a neon blue from powerful shielding and can carry a dangerous laser rifle. Phase Commanders can teleport through walls and appear anywhere. Phase Casters teleport three soldiers into your fight zone. As soon as you kill them he teleports three more. These guys are tough to kill but when they go it is a \"blast\". You have to fight against MECHS but you also get to drive them a few times. Things can get crazy when you are fighting soldiers, suicide cultists and getting attacks from psychic forces one after another. The AI is pretty clever most of the time. They will duck, hide and try to flank you. It can also be a little funny like when you blow a guy in half with the shotgun and you hear, \"somebody get a tourniquet!\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good FPS on a PC", "unixReviewTime": 1312848000, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2011"}

Whether or not you loved or loathed F.E.A.R. 2 it is almost impossible to say that the next is just like the last, and F.E.A.R. 3 is no exception. Many were thinking that this would be a dud due to lack of press and hype usually given to sequels these days, but this is certainly not the case.As much as many of us wanted this to be the same as Fear 1 it most certainly is not, and why should it be? We were already given Fear 1 if that's what you want then go play it! Instead we are treated to more of a true sequel to the first and all the scary, creepy, bloody fun that we expected from Fear 2 but didn't quite receive.The first F.E.A.R. game pushed the limits of PC gaming hardware at the time and found a way to scare itself into our blackened, desensitized little hearts. Fear 3, while not the most cutting edge graphic wise is sure to make you jump back a few times with plenty of (WTF!) moments. F.E.A.R. was one of the few games that were able to grab my attention in first few minutes; this is how I normally know when a game is great or just passable. I download F.E.A.R. 3 from Steam right at Midnight; the game took only 30 minutes to download on a 30 mbps connection pulling 3.1 Mbps. I decided to give it a quick run through before I went to bed at about 12:35 and ended up turning it off at about 7:00 AMIn the single player campaign you start as Point Man the (first games protagonist), you and your brother Paxton Fattel (the original antagonist) are sitting in a holding cell inside an asylum overseen by Armacham. You spend the first level breaking out of the asylum fighting through hordes of solders and Break your way into the underground sewers. The game doesn't start to flex its fright muscles until you get into the third level in which you find yourself back in your original surroundings running through the WalMart from hell.Day 1 Studios went out of their way to deliver some of the best scenery I have ever seen in a shooter. The environments are gritty, dingy, and downright disturbing with plenty of blood smeared walls, naked corpses bound to the ceiling, psychotic episodes, bodies dangled on meat hooks and rooms that change right before your eyes. Alma is still in the game but not to the magnitude that of F.E.A.R. 1. Without giving any spoilers there is another entity stalking you this time around that makes even Alma shudder.My only serious complaint is the enemy AI that, at times seem downright stupid, spitting out the same line of dialog over and over but they will hunt you down and you will find yourself backed into a corner quite often. Overall this is an excellent addition to the franchise that is already impressing fans and critics alike this is not F.E.A.R. 1 or F.E.A.R. 2 this is F.E.A.R. 3 and it has done a great job of standing apart from the rest.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Dark, disturbing violent fun!", "unixReviewTime": 1308614400, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2011"}

MacMahon", "helpful": [21, 24], "reviewText": "Let's get this out of the way right off the bat: FEAR is one of my favorite games of all time.  It's insanely fun and fast-paced shooting, it's marvelous AI, it's extremely impressive graphics and combat effects (many of which are still unrivaled) and it being one of the last true PC singleplayer shooters all put it on a pedestal in my mind.  If you disagree with that we are coming into this review from different directions, yet I still think you should listen to what I am going to say.  Why?  Because FEAR 3 is absolutely NOTHING like FEAR, yet I still love it.FEAR 3's singleplayer campaign puts you in the shoes of Pointman from the original game, tasked with finding Alma and stopping her pregnancy that we learned about in FEAR 2.  The story is rather bland and typical, but FEAR was never about a strong story really.  It was more about strong moments, interactive scares and revelations that happened dynamically as you played the game.  FEAR 3 is not as good at this, a clear example of how the change in developer (from Monolith to Day 1 Studios) has effected the game.  Atmosphere has changed as well, and maybe for the better depending on your priorities.  While FEAR and for the most part FEAR 2 were about dark and moody environments FEAR 3 has a little of that but mostly takes place in brightly lit outside environments with a standard military shooter feel.  There is a South American village during the day, a suburb at dusk, a sunny daytime city level (the longest in the game) and more like this.  Only a creepy department store level and some parts at the end really felt like traditional FEAR environments to me.FEAR's main focus is on gameplay though, and the changes keep on coming.  FEAR 3 feels much more like a standard military shooter when you play as Pointman.  They have added a cover system that actually works really well and reminds me of Medal of Honor Airborne of all games.  You remain in first-person when in cover, it basically just adds a traditional lean functionality when you are near a wall.  It works well.  Everything is more flat and enemies are slower than in FEAR, a sign of console development.  It's alright though, it's different from FEAR but still fun.  The weapons still pack a punch and slo-mo is still a blast to mess with.Thing is, FEAR 3 is not just about this traditional Pointman experience.  FEAR 3 is a co-op game as well.  One thing I want to really praise with FEAR 3 before I get further into multiplayer is that singleplayer still feels like a real singleplayer game.  Unlike Borderlands or Resident Evil 5 or whatever other co-op focused game you can think if, FEAR 3 does not feel like an offline bot match when playing solo.  The character player two uses in co-op, Paxton Fettel from the original game, is not even there in person when playing solo, he just speaks to you using telepathy and exists as a ghost outside the game world.  It works very well.  You know what also works well?  Paxton Fettel as a gameplay character.Playing as Fettel is an entirely different game almost.  Fettel can levitate enemies, buff Pointman, possess enemies and shoot energy.  The entire FEAR 3 shooter experience changes from well-executed yet standard military fare to a unique shooter experience not seen anywhere else.  You will posses bodies and run around like crazy causing chaos, then return to ghost form and take cover.  You will levitate enemies and shoot them with energy blasts, giving you a more wild gameplay feel than the reserved and often in cover Pointman.  In short it changes the game up considerably and almost makes FEAR 3 two games in one.  The best part is: if you're not into online co-op like me you can still play as Fettel in any level you complete as Pointman.  This basically doubles the 6 or so hour campaign and adds a ton of replay value.  There are several multiplayer modes as well if you're into that, many of them focusing on co-op.  Typical hoarde modes, a mode where you have to run from never-ending walls of death and others.  There is a lot of value here for single and multiplayer gamers, it's not just a fire and forget 6 hours.The PC port is... typical, I guess.  Textures and effects look about normal for an Xbox 360 game and though the game can look quite good at high resolutions with AA and AF applied it doesn't really stand out from the crowd.  Annoyingly it does not have a toggle for motion blur, which is an effect I hate, but hopefully they patch that in like Monolith patched a grain toggle into FEAR 2.  Standard controls and mouse precision are here without any issues.  The game actually detected my 5-button mouse by default, which is nice.  DRM is Steamworks, which is arguably a good thing because of all the co-op stuff you can do (though it should have the option for an offline singleplayer-only install).All in all FEAR 3 is a lot different from FEAR and FEAR 2, but how much this is a bad thing depends on your perspective.  It has good environments and fun yet typical combat, but then it twists everything up with a really crazy second character who's fun to play and a co-op mode that doubles or even triples the gameplay.  If, like me, you are mostly an offline gamer you will still get a solid modern shooter campaign and then a crazy fun and unique second-go.  If you're going to play this online you get tons of co-op fun an solid online modes.  It's a surprise hit if you ask me, and at the very least much more interesting than FEAR 2, which was basically just FEAR again only not as good.

(you know it stands for First Encounter Assault Recon right?) was marked as an excellent shooter due to it's scary atmosphere, solid shooting, and (at the time) system pushing graphics. Two installments later the game has fizzled out as an above average shooter and has lost most of its scare value over the years. The game also feels more paramilitary than paranormal with the same generic soldiers, mechs, and the occasional tough boss. At this point if you haven't played the first game you will be completely lost in the plot. Even people who played the first and second when they came out might want to search Wikipedia for a plot refresher because F.E.A.R. has always been known for its holy plot and confusing endings.The game feels a bit different from the last two games, but not by much. The game is more tight ended with a better cover system, a couple of new weapons, and slightly updated visuals. You have your standard affair of weapons from assault rifles, sub-machine guns, shotguns, rocket launcher, and the few original weapons. The weapons feel solid though yet the aiming is a bit touchy. Every gun feels different and you must really use them at the right situations. This isn't a stick-with-one-gun type of game. The slo-mo is back, but you can now upgrade yourself by doing things you normally would in the game and earn points. F.3.A.R. is based around co-op this time around so you can play as either main protagonist Point Man or his dead brother Fettel who follows you around the story.You get points by collecting weapons, doing kills, headshots, using cover for a certain amount of time, finding the rare Alma dolls, dead bodies that give you Psychic Link points etc. Throughout the campaign whoever scores the most points gets to see that ending of that brother. It's a neat way to do co-op, but you can still enjoy the game by yourself. The game brings back the awesome mechs and they feel better than ever. You get to use them more often than the last entry so look forward to some awesome mech sections.When it comes to atmosphere I feel Project Origin pulled it off the best. That game was downright scary, but F.3.A.R. loses it somehow by concentrating too much on the action. Sure there are some points that make you jump, but Alma doesn't appear nearly as much, and those truly scary points are far and few between. The ending is even disappointing and still doesn't answer anything, but just concludes Point Man's journey to find Alma and his dad. Alma is what made F.E.A.R., but due to her lack of exposure in this final entry it just feels like an almost generic shooter. Not only that, but the campaign is really short with only 8 levels that can be beaten in about 8 hours.has the best multiplayer suite in the series with the head mode being F****** Run! where Alma's contractions (play the story to know what I am talking about) brings the walls down on you and you have to well...run. Its to bad no one is playing online anymore so you probably have to stick to LAN on this one. That's a bummer despite the game being so recent compared to the thousands who played F.E.A.R.`s separate mulitplayer mode that was released months later from the original. There are other modes to be had in the game, but if you can't get a LAN party going then you're stuck with co-op or just the single player.Overall F.3.A.R. has decent visuals, but for some reason the game has serious performance issues even on high end systems. Constant stuttering, complete hang ups and other issues bog down the experience a little. The game is enjoyable at best, but I doubt you will run through the game a second time (even with a buddy) just to see the quick second ending (that's what YouTube is for). I recommend this for long time F.E.A.R. fans, but new comers should start at the beginning or move on.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Another confusing story with little scare", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2012"}

It would surprise me very much if this were simply a direct port, especially as it's running in DX11; it's very likely that the console versions look terrible, but that just isn't the case with high-end PC equipment capable of running DX11.

Also i really liked Timeshift(from Sierra) as well for all the reverse, stop time, and slow motion actions you could perform in it. Well the same holds true for this game, although it's more gruesome and the story is much better. The graphics if you have a great gaming rig look great, much better than consoles (of course), but still not as good as say Starcraft II or Battlefield BC 2, somewhere in between. The shooting is the same, as is taking cover, jumping, aiming etc. Everything is in tact, and in many ways it's a bit better than FEAR 2 Project Origins, which i liked a lot. It was far scarier and really engrossing, also it didn't have a lot of guys running around saying, lost him, GD, S.O.B, target spotted and the likes. So FEAR 3 doesnt break any new ground, it just does a nice job of covering the old and picking up where it left up. The game wasn't a big seller, and there was not a lot of hype surrounding the game. I didn't even know about it till about 4 months ago, when i saw it in Game Informer. So if you like the other FEAR games, then you'll enjoy this one as well, the first is the best, then the second, and then 3, as it should be i think. So expect some good, bloody, impressive scares, but don't look for this to be FPS of the year. Even though it's not your average one, to someone just getting into the franchise, it may seem that way.

This one was a snooze, however. I guess I've moved on from enjoying this genre because I was basically bored with FEAR 3. The plotline with the other two never did interest me, it was the fights and general mayhem that used to be fun but . . . esh, maybe I'm just getting jaded. I found this one, although perhaps better done in some respects than the other two, just plain boring.PROSThe maps were definitely more interesting -- the previous versions tended to be endlessly dark and repetitious; this one had more variety and was literally lighter in many places.Although not overly varied, weapons were good and the sound/effects were very satisfying.Enemy AI was good, very challenging. If you like lots of good long hard fights -- many of which are mini boss-fights -- this is your game. This was perhaps the best part of FEAR 3, the fights. Your fast twitch muscles will definitely get a workout. Frankly, the fights are the only thing I can recommend about this game, if fights are your thing.Graphics -- nothing new but quite good overall, no complaintsPerformance -- again, good overall. No issues installing and playing on my older XP system.Gameplay -- no bitches. Cover system was straightforward, controls standard, no clunkinessCONSREALLY stupid navigation. None of the FEAR series gives you a compass or map which I understand makes the game more challenging but really folks, THIS challenging? Some of the maps were not hard to get through but others were ridiculous to the point of one almost wanting to pack the game in. I mean, really. Just annoyingly overly-let's-mess-with-them-to-make-the-game-longer. That was my biggest bitch about this game, the deliberatly misleading navigation. It took the fun out of half the intervals [that's what FEAR calls a mission], this getting lost and having to restart things or even go to Youtube to figure out where in heck you lost the thread. Man, that got old.Seemingly endless enemy AI -- some the of this made no sense. You fought like heck to clear an area and minutes later are getting shot in the back by fresh troops who have miraculously spawned out of nowhere. WTF?Zombies. I DO NOT GET ZOMBIES. Obviously somebody does, otherwise why do we keep seeing this excruciatingly boring element crop up in other games? If you like zombies, would you please explain to me what I am missing? Thank you.Dumb and repititious script/voice acting. I frequently took the headphones off just so as not to listen to this tripe.Plot -- who cares. Am I the only one?Ending -- again, after all that grief, who cares? Am I the only one?In short, this isn't a bad game, just not my cup of tea anymore. Given that, it wasn't bad enough to give it a two star rating for gameplay, and not good enough for a four, so I gave it a three, which falls sort of that middle ground of Personal Preference vs Game Type.

The graphics and mechanics have improved. Controls function now universally instead of having to hit the circle button to melee (I never did like that). The campaign isn't real long, but it's longer than the others considering now you have two characters to play with through each interval. You unlock Fettel after you complete an interval with Pointman. It's best if you just complete the story with Pointman first though and then go back and do all the intervals so you don't get mixed up and have trouble getting your \"Missing accomplished..?\" trophy. Speaking of melee earlier, you can jump kick, run and sweep, or knife depending on your movement. Fettel kills people with melee instantly if they are suspended and you hit R3 near them. I find the melee to be considerably more fun than the previous games allowing me to desire knifing or kicking all my enemies to their deaths. Gun play is smooth and I find it quite easy to head shot my enemies. Pointman has slow mo so he can hit his enemies dead on and with Fettel, he can suspend his enemies and head shot them with his psychic blasts. The best thing about Fettel is his ability to possess almost any character in the game allowing you to take control of their abilities and weapons. If you die in the possessed body, Fettel with simply drop it and continue fighting. If you get tired of the possessed body, you can commit suicide and blow your insides to out by pressing triangle. One downfall for this game is that no one plays online...at all. No one does matchmaking or even online co-op which is a drag because I've always wanted to play co-op online. I have played co-op offline however and it is still challenging if you do not work with your partner.

Whether you're looking for a game to play online with a friend, or offline in split screen (as I did), you'll be hard pressed to find a comparable experience to what F.E.A.R 3 offers.In this game, one player will take control of Point Man, a solider with a haunted past who does the majority of the shooting in the game.  His special ability to slow down time for more accurate shots is awesome and very useful.  The other player takes control of Fettal, Point Man's sadistic cannibal brother who plays more of a support role using telekinetic powers.  He can create a shield around Point Man to reduce his damage taken, levitate enemies and suspend them in the air to make easy targets for Point Man, and most enjoyably, possess the bodies of enemies.These two roles combine to make what becomes a surprisingly tactical, yet incredibly action packed and enjoyable first person shooter campaign.  The campaign can get quite challenging at some points, and it is really fun to work with your partner and experiment to find out what the best tactics are to overcome and advance forward, especially given the very different abilities that each of you has.  Technically, the game is extremely well put together.  The shooting mechanics are as solid as any of this generation's best FPSs, and there is also a cover system that works extremely well, which is rare in a game that uses the first person perspective.  The level design is incredible.  The levels are huge and diverse and full of creepy moments.  Enemy AI is definitely a cut above.  They are very smart, using cover and flanking techniques and forcing you out of cover with grenades.  There are even mechs you can pilot!  It is clear that this new developer of the F.E.A.R series, Day One Studios, has put the focus on game mechanics and making this a top tier experience in terms of gameplay, perhaps at the expense of creating a more suspenseful, frightening game.  This may disappoint some long time fans of the series.However, for someone like me who is always on the hunt for a very good, smart, and action packed game that can be played with a friend in person, F.E.A.R 3 absolutely delivered the goods, and then some.

I love the horror-shooter style game play.When I first started playing F.3.A.R. I was disappointed with the graphics and the basic map layout. It seemed so plain and boring. I was almost ready to sell it back just to get it off my shelf. So needless to say I did not feel that F.3.A.R. had a strong start. Then there was a cut scene and a helicopter crashed into a bulk shopping store warehouse type building. This is where I really started to enjoy the game. From that point on, the game is awesome. It is dark, spooky and very atmospheric. The music is perfect for the game and greatly complements what actions are taking place. Controls are great and fast. This is an action game first and foremost, yet there are a few parts which make you jump. For example, there were times where people jumped out of nowhere and surprised me. However the most frightening times where in dark areas when you hear a slight something, then next thing you know someone is looking you in the face. They really took advantage of the darkness, however it could have been much more freighting. I loved the demolished buildings and grungy dirty gritty locations. It did remind me of the Condemned games at times.I would say my only real complaint would be some of the map layouts. In the beginning you're running around this little town on a mountain and it just feels like they were trying to pull a Modern Warfare or Medal of Honor. It just didn't look good and was not fun for me. The fun times are when they stick with the roots of F.E.A.R. and hide monsters in the shadows and surround you with darkness. Being in an unknown dark area with only a flickering flashlight to guide you can be quite scary.There is a psychological aspect of the game, not only in the storyline but also throughout the game play. Seeing things, flashbacks and things that are there then not there adds to the creepiness of the game. However there were other times where I felt like I was playing some military shooter reject. For me my fun meter with this game fluctuated as I played through. It started off low, then went up when things got creepy, then when down when soldiers started popping up again. Yes the storyline does follow and direct the game well, however they should have focused more on the monsters and less on the soldiers. Shooting some soldiers in a horror game is just like every other war shooter game out there. Fear is different due to the horror genre. They should have used the fear aspect more than your basic shooter.PRO's+ Solid controls+ Amazing Soundtrack, great sound+ Intriguing storyline+ Creepy atmosphere, however at the graphics expense+ Split-Screen co-op is great and a lot of fun+ Good AICON's- Graphics are not the best, however they were shooting for more of an atmosphere- Frustrating Map's at times. Quite easy to get lost or loose your bearings- New cover feature is nice, however it gets frustrating when you stick to walls- Lack of real horror, yet still spooky at timesIf you are a fan of the F.E.A.R games then this is a must play. It is just as good as the first two games, but not as scary. First person shooter fans will also enjoy this game, however do not expect anything close to Modern Warfare in terms of graphics, maps and over all game play. It is a classic F.E.A.R. game, however it does have some little things thrown in as something new to offer.Will I play this game again?

Vanackooy", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I started this game a while back (finished Fear 2 solo and loved it), but stopped about 2/3 of the way through.  The game started feeling too much like a grind and was getting increasingly difficult solo.  Might have been one of those times when another game caught my attention and I never got back to it .Then recently, after my brother and I discovered the fun of online co-op, we decided to give Fear 3 another chance.  Much more fun than solo and some of the tougher parts (still not easy by any means) were easier to get through with two players.  Finished co-op in 4 days.  Once we started, it was hard to stop.  The co-op was a blast.I am normally not a fan of checkpoint auto saves, but the checkpoint save system in this game is very good.  Getting killed doesn't mean you have to go through a lot to end up right where you were.  Very nicely done.  Getting killed by a tough enemy usually means you come right back there to try it again.  A lot better than having to go through half a level just to meet him again.Gunplay is excellent.  Not a great variety of weapons, but some very good ones.  The shotgun is a must have gun in most parts of the game.  One of the best shotguns in any game.  Only drawback is being limited to two weapons at a time.  It is always a tough decision to toss down a gun you like, because you found one more suited for the occasion or one that had more ammo.Some of the bigger and tougher enemies require strategy and not just brute force or rate of fire to kill.  Making a victory even more satisfying when accomplished.  One particular enemy took multiple times to kill, but the eventual strategy and tactics used made it all worthwhile when he finally met his maker.  You can go in guns blazing in some parts, but the mini bosses require strategic planning and often a hit and run (duck for cover) approach.The solo game is tough and should provide a challenge even to experienced players.  Co-op provides a tough challenge, but teamwork makes more difficult parts manageable.  In co-op, each person gets a distinctly different character, each with unique abilities.I played co-op as Pointman and he has a nice 'slow-down the action' psychic ability.  The other player gets a really cool psychic ability that allows him to temporarily \"take over\" an enemy.  The power allows him to zap himself across the area and possess an enemy.  Makes for some game changing moments in the middle of combat.It wasn't quite as scary as Fear 2, until you hit the last interval.  Then the horror aspect showed up more strongly.This is a fun, shooting romp that should be well worth the low price it will take to get it now.The game isn't overly long, and can get frustrating to a solo player, but the co-op more than makes up for any shortcomings.  Worth a look if you are searching for an inexpensive online co-op game with good 1st person shooting action or if you are a solo player looking for a shooter with a bit of a challenge.  A good game that is elevated to great in the co-op experience.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Better co-op than solo.", "unixReviewTime": 1381190400, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2013"}

I've just finished the single-player campaign as Point Man, but most of what I have to say will probably apply to co-op.  I'll admit that I haven't played through as Fattel yet, so I concede that I have no idea what the game is like if you play as him.On one hand, they've polished the gameplay to perfection.  Character movement is smooth and feels natural, and target assist helps you spray bullets a little less than the first two required.  The armored suit parts are fun (if a little short) and as with FEAR 2, help break up the pace.  Creeping around enclosed environments is fun, but a good old fashioned blow everything up mech segment is a nice way to give yourself the occasional reset.On the other hand, it's just not that interesting.  You end up back in the city that got the \"physic nuke\" from Alma in the last game, and it's crawling with crazed people who've been whacked in the head by the Alma bomb.  Sadly, unlike the interesting and weird soldiers and warped entities from the first two, the people in this one basically act like rabid zombies.  So, most of the game feels like a mix of gunfights against conventional soldiers and a rabid axe-wielding zombie hunt.  The weapons are less interesting, too, although the duel-wield, full-auto pistols are way cool and better than similar guns in any other game.The scare factor goes way down, although unlike some critics, the Alma-pops-up-outta-nowhere-then-vanishes moments are always fun to me.  But that's it.  This isn't really creepy the way the first two were.  And the enemy AI is almost TOO good.  The level of difficulty is ramped way up, and you get mobbed by soldiers a lot more than before.  Whereas in the first two you might find yourself facing a dozen enemies, it was almost always in an enclosed space like a large office or cellar, with plenty of opportunity to pick them off.  Now they throw a dozen soldiers at you within an open plaza or yard that, yes, has plenty of cover opportunities; but you get flanked so quickly and often that cover doesn't do much good.  Or, along with a dozen soldiers coming from all directions, they throw an enemy mech at you along with them.  A shame, really, because the new cover system is simple and works well.  And this game badly suffers from \"alternate universe grenade syndrome.\"  Yours suck, yet the constant hailstorm of enemy grenades (and they throw a LOT of grenades in this) are near-fatal.To sum up, FEAR 3 plays like a missed opportunity.  They did polish what needed polishing, but the stuff that made you say out loud \"oh, cool!\", like the ash people in the street in FEAR 2 that puffed away when you touched them, is completely absent.  FEAR has become a by-the-numbers shooter with a good story and controls, but nothing worthwhile to add for atmosphere or enemies.  And, for a FPS junkie like myself who's played dozens, it's, well, kinda hard!  And I'm playing on \"recruit.\"  Barely surviving an overly-frantic gunfight really isn't as fun or satisfying as more moderately paced action.  You finish, the screen a red haze, and just feel relieved that you made it, not satisfied that you did a good job.I knew FEAR 2 would be hard to follow up, and I'm sad to say they failed to live up to it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not bad, but not half as good as the first two", "unixReviewTime": 1312070400, "reviewTime": "07 31, 2011"}

The guns are varied and satisfying and the main protagonist's ability to slow time is an absolute blast. Activating this ability and systematically headshoting 3 or more enemies in one graceful sweep is an immensely satisfying experience. Upon completion you are giving the chance to replay the game as the protagonist's brother (Fettel) who is able to shoot energy from his hand and posses his enemies.Unfortunately I found the story unsatisfying, particularly the ending. I won't spoil it but I felt that Alma, the most important character in the game, wasn't explored further as she ought to have been. I also didn't get why the main protagonist hated his brother and mother because all things considered, they were all victims of an evil organization.

FEAR was about point man but they never showed his face and FEAR 2 is about Beckett. In FEAR 3, they actually showed point man's face but he never spoke. Some realism disappeared location wise from FEAR and FEAR 2. FEAR 3 tries to quickly conclude the FEAR series but in my opinion fails to do just that.

You see I am autistic as such many of the games more subtle cues I like totally miss. Unfortunately in FEAR 3 you really have to search the game world for weapons. Also in Fear 3 you can't just shoot everything that attacks you. In FEAR 3 it pays off big to Maylee some of the creatures you encounter. It is especially effective if you just beat the pig like gray to orange glowing creatures to death by stabbing them repeatedly. The ice blue dudes were hard to kill at first but eventually one gets a taste for it even a knack. I am not a man long on patience when it comes to video games. Honestly on Easy Mode I was able to win against the game in campaign mode and if was both difficult and fun for me once, I mastered an understanding of how the game wanted to be played.FEAR 3 is a lot of fun but only if you adopt the playing style dictated by the game which makes the game less fun and more linear. FEAR 3 does do something I find painfully bad in any video game. I have found that when playing video games there are some weapons I love far more than others. Generally speaking give me a quick loading sniper rifle and no enemy is safe no matter where or how far away he is. When I am armed with a powerful sniper rifle with an equally powerful look down sight any enemy I see is living on barrowed time and I will collect their debt permanently.With each installment of FEAR 3 the game just takes your favorite gums away and replaces them with the garbage guns the game wants you to have. Un a FPS there is no relationship more scared that that between a player and their favorite gun. What made matters worse is Fear 3 had one of the BEST Sniper Rifles I had ever been honored to use in any game. The FEAR 3 Sniper weapon made enemies just explode and the sensation of killing was a visual visceral state of near carnal rapture that never got old. After learning when to use it the laser gun was also a big favorite. Driving and killing everything that moved using those huge lumbering MECH's was also a much improved totally awesome experience in FEAR 3. The dialogue in FEAR 3 just was not as funny and over the top as it had been in FEAR 2. FEAR 2 set the standard for soldier dialogue, it was vulgar, common and had comedic timing that few video games could match with maybe the exception of Borderlands!The Fear 3 ending was rather uninspired. Interval 8 the final installment in Fear 3 was not nearly long enough, involving enough or satisfying enough. The disorientation effects were way over the top and were not much more than a bother than adding any excitement. The game itself was rather strong and fun which made the ending appear lame and weak. I enjoyed the story through much of the game play. I enjoyed some of the locales. The game play was too liniar. Since the game allowed you to carry only two weapns types I think it should have let you always keep the weapons you like most. Also ammo is scare in FEAR 3 a fact that makes the game more tedious rather than more fun.All in all however for the tiny $18.00 investment I made buying this game I could have done worse and often have. For its price $18.00 as of this writing FEAR 3 was one heck of a fun filled ride. To give you a sense of how horrible I am at playing video games most folk breeze through FEAR 3 on easy mode in approximately 6 hours so I hear. It took me three days to get through FEAR 3 on Easy Mode! So no I got few if any time bonus points in FEAR 3.

It is rare that Amazon.com gets beat on price to this horrible degree.  In the pricing of FEAR 3 the Amazon.com price got undercut so bad almost makes me want to laugh.

Before it, most dance games just consisted of moving your hands or stomping your feet to an on-screen cue. Just Dance was the first game to incorporate real dance moves to choreographed steps.Dance on Broadway plays pretty much the same as Just Dance. It retains most of its features, both positive and negative.- You follow one of four silhouetted on-screen characters, mirroring their moves as they dance.- There are also icons that scroll across the bottom of the screen that tell you what moves are coming up (basically, what \"pose\" you should be hitting when the icon hits the arrow). Honestly, I didn't find this as useful as simply mimicking the on-screen characters themseves, but I'm guessing over time once you memorize what the icons mean it'll help you perfect your performance.- Up to four players can play at the same time. Like Just Dance, this makes for a ton of fun with friends or family.- Each player holds one Wii remote. No nunchuk, no second remote, no MotionPlus is used. This is good in that it simplifies things and there are no cables to get tangled up in. It's not-so-good, as Dance on Broadway still suffers from a lack of precision in motion tracking.In addition, Dance on Broadway adds a few neat enhancements that its predecessor did not have.- The casting of the four characters matches the song. For example, for \"One Night Only\", there are four African American women which allows you to live out your dream of being one of the \"Dreamgirls\". For \"Aquarius\", there's a nice mix of hippy guys and girls.- The choreography is more detailed. For some of the songs, each of the characters has their own individual dance steps resulting in a pretty cool and fully choreographed Broadway routine when four people are playing together.- The precision of the motion tracking is a little better than before, but still leaves a lot to be desired. Still, as before it's so fun learning the dance steps that you don't really care (I was thrilled with my \"70%\" accuracy, even though I knew it was really closer to 90%). They do give the advice to hold the remote firmly in your right hand, which I found helped.- The songs are decidedly less \"intense\" than the ones in Just Dance. The songs are rated by \"difficulty\" and \"effort\", but in all honesty, even the most difficult songs were pretty simple. So it's not as good a workout game as its predecessor, but more suited for those of us who have always dreamed of being on Broadway.- There's the option to turn vocals off, meaning you can not only dance, but you can also sing along with the words.Here's a complete list of songs, the shows they're from, and their rating of Difficult / Effort in parentheses:All That Jazz from All That Jazz (1/2)Aquarius/Let the Sun Shine In from Hair (1/1)Bend and Snap from Legally Blond (2/3)Cabaret from Cabaret (3/2)Dreamgirls from Dreamgirls (1/2)Fame from Fame-The Musical (1/3)Good Morning Baltimore from Hairspray (1/1)I Just Can't Wait to Be King from The Lion King (2/2)Luck Be a Lady from Guys and Dolls (3/2)Little Shop of Horrors from Little Shop of Horrors (2/3)Lullaby of Broadway from 42nd Street (2/2)Money, Money from Cabaret (3/3)My Favorite Things from The Sound of Music (1/2)One Night Only from Dreamgirls (3/3)Roxie from Chicago (1/2)Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious from Mary Poppins (2/3)Thoroughly Modern Millie from Thoroughly Modern Millie (3/3)Time Warp from The Rocky Horror Show (3/3)We're in the Money from 42nd Street (2/3)You Can't Stop the Beat from Hairspray (2/2)In short, while I gave Just Dance 5 stars, I'll give this one 4 mainly because I would have liked to see Ubisoft improve the motion tracking more than they did, as well as include more cardio-intensive choreography. Still, it's a solid title which I definitely recommend. There are a lot of titles coming in the next few months like Ubisoft's Gold's Gym Dance Workout, Majesco's Zumba for Wii, and Konami's Dance Dance Revolution which will also focus on real dance moves. I definitely commend Ubisoft for starting this trend, and hope between these companies they can really perfect the motion controls and get the world dancing :)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for anyone who's dreamed of being on Broadway", "unixReviewTime": 1276732800, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2010"}

Do you want to get some exercise without even realizing you're working?  If you're anything like me, I think you'll like this game.  Remember the dancers in the Broadway hit, \"Fame\", dancing their hearts out to that great song?  Or the dancers in \"All That Jazz\" doing that cool tap dancey thing?  Well, this isn't quite as complicated as all that but its lots of movement and fairly easy choreography that you follow along with while the Wiimote records your moves.  You can play with up to four people.  You choose one of four characters that you would like to be at the beginning, when you choose the song.  There are 20 songs, some of which are:* \"All That Jazz\"* \"Aquarius\"* Caberet* Luck Be a Lady* Lullaby of Broadway* \"Bend and Snap\"* \"One Night Only\"* \"Dreamgirls\"* \"Time Warp\"* \"Fame\"* \"We're in the Money\"* \"Let The Sunshine In\"* \"You Can't Stop the Beat\"* \"Little Shop of Horrors Theme\"* My Favorite Things* And there's more....The idea of the game is to follow your chosen dancer, like in a mirror image, with dance, rhythm and arm movements.  One of the options is to set it so you see the words to the songs at the top of the screen and they're highlighted, kind of like a bouncing ball but without the ball, so you can sing along.  There really isn't any recording of your voice so it's just kind of for your own amusement.  When choosing a song, you see a difficulty level and an effort level shown by the number of stars.  Several of the songs are at a somewhat slow pace so it's pretty easy to follow along.  There are some little icon figures that move along the bottom that show upcoming moves.  I found it easier just to watch the dancers. The game does a reasonably good job of recording your movements and you can see with a gauge above your dancer whether you've missed the move \"X\", got an \"OK\" or a \"Great\".  It's possible to get combo points by scoring several \"Greats\" in a row.  Your points are totaled up at the end in each category.Ok, so why did I give this game only 4 stars if I like it so much?  Well, I just got the game today and after playing it for a couple hours I'm already scoring pretty well.  It's not that I'm really good at this sort of thing, in fact I'd have to say I'm pretty uncoordinated most of the time.  It's just that I like games that are more challenging and I want to get a lot of hours of enjoyment out of it.  Now I do have to say that I really, REALLY had fun playing with it tonight.  I love the music, the graphics are pretty good and I just like the whole idea of the game.  But I'm not sure a couple of weeks from now that I'll be challenged enough to be looking forward to playing it as much.  I always compare this type of game toWe CheerandWe Cheer 2, by Namco.  Those are  rhythm games as well, kind of on the same principle, but I couldn't even get past the first song for over a week.  I played those games for hours and hours trying to open new levels of songs and stages. (I still have fun playing them). With Dance on Broadway, there are 20 songs and as far as I can tell, everything is accessible right away, no additional challenges or hidden things to open.  Some of the songs like All That Jazz and Aquarius are very easy to score on because of the way these games record the Wii movements.  Now, if you want to follow along with the steps and really look like the dancers on the screen it will be more difficult. But this game, like others of it's type records only your arm movements to score.So would I buy the game again?  Yeah, I love the music and I'm a sucker for rhythm and musical type games.  But I wish it had more levels and was more challenging.  The challenge for me will be not so much the scoring, which I think I'll probably be able to ace in a fairly short time, but trying to really copy all the footwork and look like the dancers onscreen.  And while it's not as energetic as some games like We Cheer, my arms are sore after playing it for a while.  I'm not exactly huffing and puffing but it's still good exercise.  I just wish Ubisoft would have added a little more interest and more levels to this game.  It's good as far as it goes but seems as though it was rushed to market too soon.Update 6/27/10 - After playing with this game for 10 days I'm finding that the motion sensing is sometimes a little quirky.  It doesn't always pick up the motions of the Wiimote as quickly as it should.  But we've also had some really big fun with this game when we had friends over.  After a couple glasses of wine we started up the game, and after watching, had 4 people playing at a time and it was hilarious!  Watching a line of \"dancers\" make their Broadway debut with exaggerated dance movements and expressions was way funny.  And trying to outdo each other on the points kept everyone playing for a long time.  Because there are a lot of easy dance numbers like the one from \"Hair\" or \"All That Jazz\" everyone can score reasonably well after just a few tries.  And there are definitely some that are more difficult and energetic.  So I have to give the \"party potential\" 5 stars even though I rated the game 4 stars for the rest.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Get up off the couch and make your Broadway debut!", "unixReviewTime": 1276732800, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2010"}

And I encountered 4 bugs in-game. In the end where it stuck on the sound of killing me and blood splashes. And when the game ended it gave me another round, this time without a bug. And another thing I experienced in a few games, is when your teammate bot is stuck somewhere or the door closes before them and they can't follow you. So they respawn in another point. I like that. A very few times I got stuck myself and killed in fact. But then again, what game does not have bugs? The whole game was playable. And none of those bugs really affected fun or playability or didn't even get annoying.A bit of a spoiler:I am glad my favorite character(Trishka) survived in the end.

Unfortunately this doesn't always leave you time to do the things you want to do, and you find yourself repeating the same thing every few minutes.The dialogue is pretty amusing. As for the plot, I enjoy the more serious nature of it. It's my understanding that people were promised that it wouldn't take itself to seriously or something.The critical hit system or whatever it's called is what the game is all about. It promises to make you be creative and inventive in finding new ways to kill enemies. Really it just tests how well you can follow orders in an entirely imprecise and impractical system. It is very hard, very unlikely, and very annoying to get most of them. Plus, it just requires nothing creative at all. It really is just follow instructions, however the system doesn't always read things properly. Frequently the enemies just end up dying in the same ways, same as every game.Between that, and the glitches are what hold the game back for me. You never lose more than 30 seconds of play time because it autosaves regularly, but it gets annoying. You get stuck a lot in relation to gameplay. Like sometimes your whip just gets stuck in the drop box, and then you have to reset. Or the dinosaur won't move anymore so you have to reset.I didn't love the weapons either. Really the biggest disappointment for me was that there was not that much gore.The game is a really great time waster, and fun despite the issues, but it could be better. I'd wait until it is only 20-25 dollars, or rent it!

If that is what you are looking for then this is awesome!The graphics are beautiful for the outdated engine this game uses, and the frames per second stays around 35-45 all the time for me on my system with everything at maximum.

It was advertised as being something new to the world of shooters that stands out from all the others, when it has been done before many times. Kicking and witty comments - Duke Nukem... Whip/leash/arcade scoring - Bionic commando... I'm sure you can figure out the rest.Now for the Gears of War fanboys, this game is probably making them cream their pants, and it's the best game ever to them... There are even parts and sequences that are pretty much just re-textured levels from Gears. But everyone has different ideas of what is fun in a game. If you have played the first Gears of War then you have pretty much already played this game, just imagine kicking everything into slow motion first before shooting it instead.Here is the formula... Run down narrow pathway, \"oooh\" and \"ahhhh\" at scenery, find big open area with easy cover, have a shootout... hear the characters make a witty comment about the male anatomy afterward... walk down another narrow pathway to an open area, more pretty scenery... Another shootout, only with tougher baddies... More comments about male anatomy... Another narrow path, an epic boss fight (by epic, I mean ridiculous to the point of being boring.)...

But wait, this one is actually fun, so much fun. I had no idea what to expect from this. Once I saw the Unreal logo I wasn't expecting much as I'm so tired of the same Unreal gameplay just in different clothing. But Bulletstorm is something else. You're some military operative in the future and in space who has been deceived by some wicked commander to do all sorts of unsavory things. Now you find yourself on some planet and out for revenge. You're joined with a fellow soldier who due to some accident is turned into half a droid. Later you meet the obligatory tough chick who is the daughter of a journalist who was ordered killed.The AI team play here is real nice. A lot still depends on you, this isn't like COD/MW where you might as well just watch others kills. The graphics are gorgeous, the settings are for the most part bright and colorful- a welcome departure from the sickening cave/darkness scenes in all other games. And the dialogue while very adolescent gives the game character and keeps things entertaining and lighthearted. Fortunately there are not countless audio log and video logs that you have to put up with, but the story is told by the characters.Something different about this game is your ability to kick things down and kick enemies around as well as yank things toward you with a leash. There are truly lots of fun ways to kill the enemies by taking advantage of the environment. Weapons-wise I particularly enjoyed the rifle that allows you to guide the bullet. Another thing that's always enjoyable is when you have enemies that are funny, here some of them taunt you and mock you. There are a couple of bosses to many. There are a variety of settings, outdoors, indoors.The few things I didn't like include the way you resupply yourself- you have to leash on to a drop kit and from there press a combination of space-bar and return key dozens of times to get ammo and change weapons. The other \"problem\" is that this game is fairly short. Very annoying when you are having so much fun.

It is linear, no open sand box here.  The graphics, while based on an older unreal engine, are spectacular and you may find yourself taking a break and just looking around at the scenery.  I found the game very fun, with some rehashing of classics like Doom.  While the sounds and overall action was familiar, the toys that gamers think up make it all worth while.  Early on you get an electronic leash.  The one they have been showing on the TV ads.  It allows you to pull things toward you, or toss them in another direction.  The fun is in shooting at those (now) slower moving targets or throwing them into a some obstacle that will kill them.  Same thing with kicking things... old concept, but here, not only can you kick things away, but where you kick them is important... like off a cliff.Bulletstorm seemed fresher than it is to me because of the weaponry, and the variety of ways you can get through a level. Lots of ways to have fun depending on what you have decided to collect, use, and upgrade.  It is also fun for the variety of potty mouth dialog you get from your partners, and the bad guy general.  Rated NC-17!  The cutaways are fun, add to the story, and graphically rich -- giving you a break from all the killing.  The reward punishment cycles are just about perfect, especially with getting the \"leash\" early on, lots of dropped ammo, and points for skill shots.You can buy ammo and upgrades for everything you collect in well placed and frequent buy stations throughout the game.  I have two bits of advice. One, it is not super clear at the beginning that you get points for shooting the annoying little news-bots that litter the game.... shoot them.  Two, buy the leash upgrade as soon as you can... it is great fun when you can use it.  As for a minor glitch, during a boss battle, I wanted to die to start over, and I ran right into the boss and let it pummel me.  I would NOT die.  Then I ran into the electrical system I was trying to kick him into.. and normally that would have killed me... it did not. It was fun looking at things from this electrical point of view but I simply could not die, and so I completed my task another way and in the way you were supposed to...  When I started over, the same glitch was not easily found... but it was fun while it lasted.As for running, once I got through the Windows Live bits, the game started up perfectly every time... I am not going to complain about it, because despite the things that you need to do every time you visit WL, when I could not solve my problem and I called them directly... I got an answer by someone who spoke perfect English on the second ring and who understood my connection problems.  Things were up and running in less than 3 minutes.  My relatively new Asus G53JW - SSD laptop, running an Nvidia GTX 460M graphics card, wanted to max out the setting for Bulletstorm.  I let it, and observed some slow-downs and shut downs during the game.  A search for this problem on a notebook forum revealed there were problems with graphic intensive games and running an external monitor on this laptop with an older driver set.  Upgrading the driver to a current (V270) one fixed all problems.I cannot say that Bulletstorm warrants more than a couple of play-throughs, and it is pretty short for a game that costs $50+ (about 12 hours for me without really trying to beat any records)... hence 4 stars rather then 5.  But it is worth it to me.  Very fun and a game that had me coming back for more.

The amazing variety of weapons at your disposal allowed you to kill enemies in creative ways. It's satisfying to use the leash while conserving ammo. I would say the gameplay is reminiscent of the Serious Sam titles mixed with the slow-mo ability of FEAR. The locales are divided between tropical and industrial, and they look great. Since I played on a small laptop I expect it to be even more beautiful on a bigger monitor. The difficulty level isn't high (I beat it on Hard mode in 3 days) since you always have at least one companion during your fights. The enemies are very diverse but don't seem to pose much of a threat since you are such a killing machine (DEAD ECHO). The dialogue at times can be witty but mostly fail to incite laughter with its bad jokes; although the voice acting itself is quite good. I liked the character designs because they seemed realistic. Bulletstorm is a game that you'll have fun playing on your first run through but will not beg for a second.A few minor flaws that I noticed while playing is that the richness of skill points available allow you to max out upgrades on basically all weapons so there isn't much challenge in what to upgrade. Also, I feel that the leash is somewhat overpowered. You can easily pop out from behind cover to leash an enemy one by one until the entire group is gone. One last thing is that the companion should not be invulnerable. He/she never gets hurt enough to die in combat, which really detracts from the excitement of intense firefights.Overall, a decent game if you like constant action and creative ways to frag.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Engrossing action, acceptable story", "unixReviewTime": 1314144000, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2011"}

PCF even released Duty Calls, a 1-level parody game mocking the conventions of Call of Duty- a pointless experience system, needless game mechanics, and an overwrought REAL WORLD PLOT.Sadly, Bulletstorm itself jumps into modern gaming conventions with both feet. While touted as \"not another cover-based shooter\" it is TOTALLY a cover based shooter- get shot a few times and the game will warn you (invasively) to seek cover. Why? So your auto-regenerating health can kick in OF COURSE. There's no cover button, but when the game makes you use cover anyway, that kind of makes things worse. Levels are painfully linear yet still rife with invisible walls, a condition made more apparent by the fact that you cannot jump. Space becomes a movement action button, causing you to dash, and, when EXACTLY in the right place, vault over scripted obstacles. But good luck REACHING the sweet spot when scenery and your NPC helper's collision boxes make rapid navigation of the environment a huge hassle. And are there totally automatic cutscenes where you must pointlessly press buttons to progress? YES THERE ARE. A lot of them. There's also a totally unwanted experience system that serves to break up the action.For an ostensibly humorous game, Bulletstorm also kind of fails. It may be meant to be comedic, but the story and characters come across more as serious in a late 90s kind of way- perhaps funny in a metatextual sense, but not very. Comparisons to Daikatana are not inappropriate, although your helpers in Bulletstorm require mercifully less babysitting.In Bulletstorm's defense, it is a lovely game. Animations are very well achieved, the music is good, and lighting is great; and since it's Unreal technology the requirements are quite acceptable. And the combat controls always do what you want them to, although the leash, the kick, and their associated bullet time are all mechanics we've seen before. I actually found myself preferring to not use the leash because it jars the camera around and suspends your aiming, but the game forces it upon you for a number of puzzles.PROS:-Looks sexy-Good combat controls-Music and other audio are decentCONS:-Embraces nearly every worthless convention of the modern shooters it claims to be an antithesis to-Awkward motion made more so by tight, restrictive levels-Vague, generic plot could belong to any shooter made in the Voodoo generationFINAL THOUGHTS:-Buy Painkiller instead", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Falls into its own traps", "unixReviewTime": 1343865600, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2012"}

My review is predominantly about the single player mode.Like many, I play them all, shooters, RPGs, puzzle, etc.  In the past few years, there have been precious few that were exceptional, as well as a couple of fun sleepers that not many people heard of here and there.  I was a huge Painkiller player in the day, and always longed for the day when the edgy folks at People Can Fly would get a chance to put together yet another insane romp for us to play.IMHO, there's not that much objectionable with Bulletstorm.

The controls are simple, usable and reliable.  Its fast paced and frenetic.

I would not pay 15 for it though...  With that said for what it is it's \"okay\" but it does have some flaws that pretty much kill any replay value.Install went okay until finalization, after it installed the original click to install window came up again with the options of installing again, readme, exit, blah blah, play.  However you can't click on the \"play\" it won't let you i was hesitant to exit it afraid it might void my install.  Closed the window out and it worked, just a moment of WTF there...So started up the game.  and this was truly the most frustrating part for me.  it INSISTS on a ACTIVE ONLINE \"LIVE\" Account.  YOU CAN'T USE AN OFFLINE ACCOUNT TO PLAY even if you got one it REFUSES to let you.  So yeah, Active internet connection required for a single player game of this quality is a little ridiculous imho.Storyline is amusing made me laugh a few times (which would be the only replay value this game has)So what they need to do to make this game better.1. Lash control lacking, grab something and it pretty much with only little and uncontrollable variants comes directly to you A to B.  It didn't feel right, and was akward, need some control of whatever you lash or leash w/e they wanna call it, it would be nice to be-able to change their trajectory mid-flight, so i could swing them left, right, or even do a little downward tilt on the mouse and up to \"snap\" them into the ceiling.2. Needs better script, for kicking particularly.  It will \"slow mo\" anything you kick.  This is bad when your trying to impale something on a object a few feet from you, its like hurry the heck up an get out of my life already *die*.  and allies have a habit of killing them before they get impaled losing you points -_-. A Script is needed to read the end destination of the \"kicked\" and if it ='s true that its going to be impaled or /deaded on terrain - slow mo need not occur.  - Would of made it a better game/feel right.3. Needs a \"kick left\" \"kick right\" as is \"Kick\" only kicks forward which means to kick something to impale it on something to your right/left you have to physically walk to the right or left of w/e an kick it in, which was annoying.  It wouldn't of been hard to make a kick left/right being E+A E+D...  Roundhouse kicks plz watch some chuck FFS...4. Weapons were good actually but one thing you can only carry 2 (3 with the weapon it don't let you drop).  With a game like this designed to just be \"fun\" a gun limit was stupid.  I don't care if it isn't realistic to carry 6+ guns...  I JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN OKAY?!?!...  I mean its not like it was realistic to control the bullet of the sniper rifle, but that was FUN! so i didn't care...  and if it was to try to impose some kind of difficulty, why bother? this game screams just have fun, if you want to limit stuff like that SAVE IT FOR THE HARD SETTINGS, not normal -_-.5. Game length needs to double, with more bosses, and MORE Epic moments (like controling the dino and helicopter ride (of course not the same epic moment over an over but you know what i mean)  - oh and no more plant bosses that look scary but can't actually kill you that was =/ DIDN'T feel in danger at all - it can't eat you if you spam E key no real reason to move besides \"having\" to destroy the soft parts behind it.6. Oh and the game needs more refinement in the location based damage, hit things in the head for them to not count several times particularly with the sniper rifle, when hitting /low on the face.  And the genital based damage isn't very good or unclear in what it takes to activate it, the Mercy script was few and far between(supposed to be triggered by a ball shot but wasn't most of the time).If it had those 6 things, it would of been good-epic, and maybe worth more than 15 dollars...  oh and that windows live online required stuff needs to go, offline account should suffice.But OVERALL its a funish game that i \"could\" feel comfortable recommending to someone for a \"few\" hours of fun - as a last resort if they have played everything else and not this yet.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Funish, but only just \"okay\"", "unixReviewTime": 1332979200, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2012"}

The story is pretty basic, your betrayed by a general, and hunted down by bounty hunters, but there is a bit more. Lots of cut scenes and dialogue also, but once your in the action your in it. Also there is a very easy mode for people like me who don't like dying HA. The game very much reminds you of Quake and Unreal, but the graphics(especially on PC) are far superior. I have an ATI 4850 1gigDDR3, 8 gigs of DDR3, Core 2 Quad 2.67ghz, and the game runs flawless at full 1080p, all high settings. The controls are easy to learn, like most FPS, even when it gets frantic, it's pretty easy to keep your cool even when using the mouse and keys. Aiming is spot on, even if you feel sloppy, i have gotten tons of head shots without even really trying, mega plus. Also the kicking feature, that makes your enemy fly through the air in slow mo while you blow him away is great! I haven't gotten to the point where you get to use the energy pull(with the electrical stream) but i did play the demo 360, so i'm really looking forward to that as well. Hopefully its not to far into the game. I'm writing this early into it because i'm highly impressed, i just like the look, feel, and the cool enemies and new features that the game has.

{"reviewerID": "A3O1KC19TDMFV3", "asin": "B003H0CBYS", "reviewerName": "Alexander Ayers", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "From my blog: Buckeye829's Video Game Reviews - Games Under $40First Person Shooters tens to take themselves very seriously these days.  It's getting more and more difficult to tell every Battlefield Ghost: Fall of the Modern Rainbow Company from the others, and they're getting so precise.  I'll admit I had basically zero interest in playing Bulletstorm (from EA, Epic Games and People Can Fly studios) after reading and seeing previews for it.  It seemed crass and vulgar, just for shock value.  I expected a slim story with just lots of blood and guts.  Basically, all for show with little substance.  Video games are still getting a bad rap from mainstream media anyway, and I felt Bulletstorm was just adding fuel to their fire.  But something happens to me when a game falls below that $40 pricepoint.  My standards relax a little and I'm willing to give a chance to something I'd previously written off.During Bulletstorm, you play as Gray(son), a self-imposed leader of a band of mercenaries working for an elite, top-secret group, Dead Echo, which was in charge of protecting the Confederation of Planets (which has a symbol curiously similar to Halo's energy sword).  Gray is basically Marcus Fenix's baby brother with Han Solo's thirst for adventure (and wisecracking) and Duke Nukem's sensibilities.  A mission goes horribly wrong and the team is exiled and become the hunted, due to a large bounty on their heads.  Gray then becomes paired with Ishi, a fellow team member, who has undergone a bit of a transformation, which makes the pairing more unconventional than you might think.  The two set out, each with their own reasons, but willing to work together.  Gray is out for revenge, but also redemption.Gray and Ishi crash-land on the planet Stygia, which looks like a cross between Pandora (from Avatar) and Coruscant.  There are warring factions and mutants galore, which obviously leads to a fair share of combat.  The thing that separates Bulletstorm from other FPS, is the skillshot.  Anybody these days can just gun down countless enemies, one after the other, but skillshots take imagination and ..... skill.  Each skillshot warrants a point value (skill points), depending on difficulty and ingenuity, which can then be used to upgrade your weapons.  Simple kills, the old-fashioned way, only garner 10 points.  Traversing through the game that way would leave your weapons and ammo at a minimum.There are 131 different skillshots to master in Bulletstorm, and more than half of the fun is figuring them out.  Sure some are basic like kicking an enemy into an electrical source (Shocker), cactus (Pricked), or sharp metal object (Voodoo Doll), but the enjoyment comes from some of the more complex ones: Attaching an explosive to an enemy then kicking him towards a group before exploding (Homie Missile), killing an enemy with a shot to the throat (Gag Reflex), or snipe an enemy with a shot to his crotch (Nutcracker) or behind (Rear Entry).  I can just imagine the roundtable discussions that were being held coming up with the names alone, and pretty much every time I discovered a new one, I ended up smiling and the name.Gray also inherits another potent weapon, an Energy Leash, early on in the game.  The Leash is basically an electrified whip that can pull enemies that are far, closer to Gray.  When they get leashed, the enemies also slow down for more precise skillshot action.  The weapon selection in Bulletstorm gives just enough variety and spin-off from typical FPS, that it felt fresh and new.  When first playing, I felt uncomfortable not having any grenades to throw, but eventually got used to it.GameplayBulletstorm plays extremely cinematically.  As you would expect, loads of action and everything seems larger than life with explosions, blood, colors, sweeping cameras, etc. galore.  The story mode is divided into 7 acts, with 2-3 chapters into each act.  The pacing is excellent and most sections don't seem too long or too short.  I played the game on 'Very Hard' mode and it seemed like another FPS 'Normal' level.  That's the point of the game, it's supposed to be fun, not necessarily complicated or grueling.The first two-thirds of this game are really excellently done.  The eight available weapons (introduced slowly over the course of the game), especially The Leash, feel different enough from little tweaks here and there, and the variety of enemies (some fast, some charge, some stay back, etc.) really hooked me in using the full assortment of firepower available.  Pulling a pilot out of a helicopter instead of just shooting it down feels more bad-ass.  Guiding a sniper rifle bullet into an enemy's head is always enjoyable.  Kicking enemies into solid objects, with stuff splattering everywhere is always gratifying.  Adding to Gray's swashbuckling bravado, there are bottles of alcohol hidden, and if he takes a swig, the screen turns to double (or triple)-vision and the walking controls don't work as expected.  Being inebriated and dispatching of bad guys adds even more skill points.The gameplay is broken up once or twice an Act, with more scripted sequences such as rail-shooting, or eliminating waves of enemies, but is the action is unfortunately quite linear.  The pathways are all marked by invisible walls, so there is not much exploring, and if you're hunting collectibles, new checkpoints usually close previous areas.  My favorite part of the game was when I got to control a Godzilla-type creature, causing havoc with each step and shooting fire out of it's mouth at helpless thugs.The slight problem I had with Bulletstorm is that about two-thirds through I had pretty much discovered all of the skillshots I was going to discover (I think I ended up in the low 90's out of 131).  I began to rely mostly on the same few weapons (as you can really only equip two, as the basic machine gun always has to be equipped) and the same handful of skillshots.  Towards the end, I also didn't really use The Leash all that much in combat.  The enemies grew a bit stale as after a certain point, there was not much novelty.  I also thought that an online co-op mode was greatly missing, as my CPU controlled partners were never that much help.In addition to the story mode, there are a couple of extra experiences to be had.  First, are the Echoes, which are bite-sized pieces of the single player campaign in which the goal is to score as many points as possible using different skillshots.  The Echoes are timed, which factor into the score, but are a great way to try out different techniques with different weapons.  They are graded from zero to three stars depending on your score.As for online multiplayer, there is what's called Anarchy mode, which up to four players competing together to eliminate up to 20 waves of baddies, some with bosses and mini-bosses, culminating in the Blood Symphony skillshot, if you're lucky.  Initially, I was saddened by the lack of online competitive multiplayer, but the more I thought about it, I really would not want to be humiliated by some of the skillshots, via human opponents.  There have also been 2 DLC packs since launch, which bring more multiplayer maps, Echoes, and Leash colors.GraphicsThe graphics in Bulletstorm are definitely a selling point.  Bright colors mixed with the decayed steel of the city landscape really gave it a look of it's own.  The field of vision when Gray is running or sliding really puts you in the action and make the game more engaging.  The enemies are detailed, and amply filled with blood, guts, puss, etc. to make their demise a sight to behold.SoundBulletstorm proudly uses just about every curse word in the English language, but only occasionally does it feel like too much.  Sometimes a couple of curse words are put together in ways I had not heard before.  The soundtrack is appropriate ranging from heavy metal guitar riffs when you die to sweeping orchestral melodies that set the stage for the upcoming action.  The voice acting is top-notch as well, as the actors must have been cracking up at some of the lines they had to say.Replay ValueFor under $40, you get quite a bit with Bulletstorm.  The campaign should last 10-12 hours on the hardest mode then throw in the Echoes and co-op multiplayer, and you have yourself something worthy of your gaming dollar.  You probably won't go back and play the campaign again, but trying to get three stars on all of the Echoes is quite challenging.Don't go into Bulletstorm hoping for a Mass Effect story or even a Call of Duty shooter, as you'll be disappointed.  I went in with an open mind and got something that had been done before, yet fresh and exciting at the same time.  Skillshots are extremely humorous and simultaneously gratifying, and a twisted, adult sense of humor kept me amused throughout.  The game is crass, vulgar, graphically violent, and way over the top, but I smiled or laughed quite a bit and enjoyed it immensely.Score: 8.75", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bulletstorm - Not Just for Shock Value...It's Actually A Lot of Fun", "unixReviewTime": 1313107200, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2011"}

You have been warned*Bulletstorm has the potential to be the most controversial game of all time.  But, like GTA, controversy often equals fun.  What sets Bulletstorm apart from your run-of-the-mill FPS is that you are encouraged to kill enemies in brutal and creative ways.  In fact, you have to in order to be able to afford ammo and upgraded weapons, which are purchaced with skillpoints.  The surprisingly good plot revolves around Grayson Hunt, a carbon copy of Jack Black in looks and personality, and his quest for revenge and atonement for being duped into committing war crimes.  Accompanying him is his best friend Ishi, a half-man, half-machine, and Trishka, a tough-as-nails young lady who was orphaned at an early age.  The main villain, General Sarrano, is arguably the most despicable fictional villain since Dolores Umbridge, and by the end of the game, you, like Gray, will be dying to kill him in the most brutal and painful way possible.  The final showdown against Sarrano is satisfying, but could be better, and the game all but guarantees a sequel with an audio-only epilogue introducing (final spoiler warning) Darth Sarrano.Bulletstorm is crude and violent, but it is not completely over the top, because the violence (and everything else about the game) is completely unrealistic.  The humor is similar to that in the movie Mars Attacks: sadistic yet cartoony.  Weapons include a quad-barreled compressed air shotgun, a sniper rifle that allows you to steer the bullets, and a grappling beam similar to the one in Metroid Prime, but with many many more uses.  The only downside to Bulletstorm is a somewhat short campaign mode (although really no shorter than Black Ops) and online play that has still yet to get off the ground.  But if you're looking for a guilty pleasure game that pulls no punches but more importantly is tons of good old-fashioned fun, pick up Bulletstorm.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Makes GTA look like Super Mario", "unixReviewTime": 1299196800, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2011"}

Bulletstorm isn't just another typical shooter game. Well it is... but it has a twist. The game rewards you in over 100 ways to kill with skill and pushes you to be creative instead of just doing head shots all day long. The feel of the game is your typical shooter and the weapons are fantastic, I just wish there was more! Graphics and environments are absolutely beautiful. Sometimes I took a break from the action to catch my breath just to look out and appreciate the world I was in. The dialog in Bulletstorm is a riot, just fowl mouthed and obnoxiously humorous.

They really do serve to freshen up the first person shooter genre. But the ultimate question is, is it worth the 65 bucks it costs to buy it brand new?For me, no. To warrant paying almost 100 bucks for a video game, I need a little more than a 6 to 8 hour campaign. These days shooters make up for their short main storylines with added multiplayer, which adds serious longevity and value to them. I don't care how mind blowing a game is, how many new things it adds, if it takes me an afternoon to be done with it, then it's not worth 65 bucks.There are some great set pieces and moments in Bulletstorm, like the huge grinder wheel that you fight early on, battling the t-rex, and just the gameplay in itself is all top notch. Very unique things Bulletstorm throws at you. Graphics are great, the vistas are gorgeous to look at, character models are nice and the set design is pretty good. The story, is pretty interesting, given how much of it there is. The dynamic between characters is nice as well. This isn't a sprawling epic by any means, but it works and keeps you interested in playing.But back to why it isn't worth a full price purchase, for me anyways. Like I mentioned before shooters tend to be short affairs for whatever reason. Games like Borderlands & Fallout served to add some longevity to the genre with a more RPG like approach. But as great as they were, the combat lacks the face paced, visceral enjoyability that games like Call of Duty and Bulletstorm have. Fallout combat is so dull and wooden that you begin to lose interest. If only we could get some sort of merger between the two, we'd truly have something special. As it stands now the games with the great fighting gameplay you can finish in a mere afternoon, and the games with great stories and sprawling epics, combat is lacking and dull.Modern day shooters solve this by their online play, which in bulletstorm is lacking. We get two modes, \"Echoes\" and \"Anarchy\", and both feel a bit tacked on. Echoes is essentially replaying the main game levels without story elements to rack up \"high scores\". Which is great but ultimately feels hollow and pointless. Why would I want to play random levels to compete on faceless \"leaderboards\". Then there is Anarchy mode, which lets you play online with a group of people and fight against waves of enemies. You have to get to a certain score count to advance to the next \"wave\". For me, the waves ended too soon, were too easy, and had connection & game joining issues. Maybe that's because the game just came out, but joining games took me awhile and when I did the gameplay was laggy. There is no splitcreen mode for the campaign, none for a local Anarchy mode where you can fight waves of enemies with your friends. I realize having the leash mechanic playing death matches may require some creative thinking to implement, it seems like such a waste to not have better multiplayer mode offerings for such a game with great gameplay.As it stands paying 65 bucks for an 8 hour campaign just doesn't sit with me, no matter how innovative the gameplay is. Overall this is not quite a rental, meaning it's defintely worth a purchase, but more at the lower price like 40 bucks or so. Even a rental from gamefly would suffice as I can't quite see myself playing the campaign again or popping in for some laggy Anarchy. Had there been some sort of real competitive multiplayer, a more meatier, longer campaign, this would be sure purchase. As is I would say wait till the price comes done or rent it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Good Game, but flawed", "unixReviewTime": 1298419200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2011"}

It was also shown every '80s action and sci-fi movie ever made about a dozen times, given a bottle of whiskey, handed a gun and instructed to shoot anything that moves. Yes, Bulletstorm is ridiculous, but in the way that the very best guilty pleasures are. Like nearly all FPS games, this one has a paper-thin plot and one-dimensional characters, and as such the real crux of the game is the violence. Not the amount, but the inventiveness. This game succeeds in providing a great setting within which you can shoot, kick and energy leash bad guys to death in a huge numbers of ways. From a simple headshot to remotely guiding a (sometimes) human bomb into other enemies and beyond, the possibilities for being sadistic for points are awesome. The world is filled with deadly surprises with which to dispatch foes gruesomely (and stylishly), whether it's giant cacti or blast furnaces.You shouldn't go into Bulletstorm expecting a cover-to-cover affair. Sure, there are points where you have to get out of the line of fire or risk death, but for the most part it's full-bore shooting. In this sense, it's a total throwback ... almost a super-polished arcade game.Overall, this game is big, loud and most importantly fun!

You've just encountered your former commander, who basically used you to kill innocent people.  Your response?  You blow his ship to Kingdom Come, and crash land on a very inhospitable planet.  Your best friend is almost killed and has to be forged with advanced robotics.  Your new objective is to find and protect the very man whose life you just tried to eradicate.  Between you and him stand hordes of baddies wanting to do bad things to you.  But it's okay, because you have a lot of f****** weapons.The story to BULLETSTORM is as simple as you can get; the voice-acting is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious, and nothing makes any sense at all.  It's just the way you want it in an action game.  What you're probably looking for are graphics (remarkable), weaponry (so-so), action (lots of it, but kind of repetitive), and length (short).  If you take all of that in, you know what you're getting with BULLETSTORM--a middle-of-the-road First Person Shooter that offers nothing much new (the electric whip is cool, but BIOSHOCK beat them to it, and with a much better storyline and longer game play).  It'll satisfy for a few hours, but I recommend renting this one.  I didn't try the multiplayer (I don't do it; hate me if you want), but the repeated playing potential of this game just wasn't there for me.  It's initially interesting trying to kill baddies in different ways, but it gets old after a bit, and to be brutally honest, this storyline just isn't engaging enough to want to come back to.  Maybe when the price drops, as it eventually will, the game will be worth acquiring permanently; as it stands, BULLETSTORM is worthwhile to FPS enthusiasts, or those of you who want to spend a few hours (took me about eight, but I'm a terrible gamer and play ridiculously slow) blowing sizable holes in various lifeforms.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fun but frustrating--short but somewhat satisfying.", "unixReviewTime": 1300060800, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2011"}

But then I liked Gears of War and Shadow Complex games and since this was also being released by Epic, I thought why not give it a shot. After finishing the campaign mode and trying Ecos and Anarchy modes, I have to say I am quite surprised.***********PROS.***************-AWESOME COMBAT SYSTEM: This is the best aspect of this game. You can slide, leash to pull enemies, kick them and use variety of weapons with primary and second fire and pull a huge variety of combination off of them. At first you may feel like it may get redundant, but thanks to variety in levels, there are a huge variety of things you can do. Thanks to that you won't get bored till the end of the campaign.-VARIETY IN LEVELS: Other than awesome combat, there is plenty of variety in levels. Throughout the campaign you experience a variety of environments including the space, woody greenery filled areas, abandoned factories, building high in the sky that is about to fall apart and list goes on.-SURPRISES: There parts during the campaign where you will be surprised by certain events and the gameplay that will follow it. I really don't want to spoil it for you, but trust me you will like it.-GREAT GRAPHICS AND DECENT ART WORK: The first time I saw the trailer for this game, it really looked unpolished to me. But now that I have finished the campaign, I can say that since then they seem to have refined it quite a bit. Certain levels just look gorgeous. I guess never doubt the power of unreal engine.-VARIETY IN WEAPONS: There are 8 different types of weapons and that is not including the leash. Each weapons (including leash) has devastating alternate fire mode. There is just plethora of combos you can do if you mix and match these weapons. I personally enjoyed each and every one of them. Also, while some weapons may look and sound familiar from other games, they will play very differently in this game. For example with sniper rifle in this game you can change the direction of bullet after you fire it. I personally have enjoyed the variety very much.-UPGRADABLES: To top of each weapon is upgradeable with the skill point you earn by killing enemies in creative ways. This rpg element will truly encourage you to creatively kill enemies and get as many skill points as possible. While this rpg element is not as well thought of as other games, it still adds incentive to do your best.-ONLINE PLAY AND ECOS MODE: While not my favorites (see cons.), after you finish the game, you can stay busy by playing online multiplayer (anarchy mode) or Ecos mode which has the same levels as campaign but gives you stars on your performance.************CONS************-RELATIVELY SHORT CAMPAIGN: Hate how games these days have such short single player campaigns. Unfortunately bulletstorm is one of them. While I enjoyed each and every moment of the campaign I found it to be very short (~7-8 h max and that is because I explore a lot).-MINOR GLITCHES: I had my character stuck while jumping over objects at least 3-4 times. Unacceptable. All the games have glitches, but under no circumstances your character should be stuck like this. I mean you can't even kill yourself. Restarting the level is the only option.-MEH MULTIPLAYER AND ECOS MODE: Compare to some other games these days, I didn't enjoy the multiplayer so much. I got tired of it rather quickly. Also the Ecos mode felt the exact same as the campaign. I wish they had added more varieties.-LACK OF NEW GAME+ MODE: This is a game that can really use a new game+ mode (i.e. start with all the weapons you collected etc.). Unfortunately, it doesn't have it. So there are some really cool weapons and upgrades you get towards the end of the game. Unfortunately, if you want to use them again, you will have to play the game again and you will only get to use them for last few levels. Just very unfortunate.**********CONCLUSION****************Simply speaking I am looking forward to Bulletstorm 2. Partly because I enjoyed this game and partly I have faith in the developers that they will improve the weak aspects of this game. All and all I enjoyed pulling off crazy combos in beautiful, but destructible environments, but I wish they had longer campaign and had fixed some of the things described in the con section. I give this game 8.5/10.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quite Surprised", "unixReviewTime": 1299542400, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2011"}

The multiple interviews (on G4tv.com mainly) and their small parody game (Duty Calls) had me laughing to no end.  The results had me pre-ordering the game, but I was unfortunate to put it on top a growing pile of games I needed to work on (which is why the review is a month late).The selling point is the single player campaign mode of the game rather than the multiplayer (which is mainly teaming up against AI opponents) and scoring the most in creative kills.The graphics are gorgeous and fluid, the gameplay is fantastic, and the story is enthralling.  It is the opposite of \"Homefront.\"  Homefront's style is to focus on the multiplayer, but mess up everything else as long it has a good premise.  Bulletstorm allows you to explore all the levels and rewards you by doing so rather than going in an obvious linear fashion (still linear, but most FPS' are...).I was shocked to find that the cast were veteran voice actors and did an excellent job all around.Steve Blum (voice of Wolverine, Captain Foley [Call of Duty]), Orochimaru [Naruto], etc.) did an awesome job with Grayson Hunt.Jennifer Hale (voice of Jean Grey, Cinderellla, Ophelia [Brutal Legend], etc.) had me a few moments when she starts swearing in every sentence as Trishka. Loved it!Anthony DeLongis (voice of Marshall Leigh Johnson (Red Dead Redeption), but is included in Babylon 5, Star Trek: Voyager, and Highlander: the series) voiced for General Serrano.  I honestly thought R. Lee Ermey (Gunnery Sgt.

Fox News can give it all the bad news (aka publicity) it wants (ala Hillary Clinton and GTA).

{"reviewerID": "AZVCNOOQK36DH", "asin": "B003H0CBYS", "reviewerName": "DryvBy", "helpful": [13, 14], "reviewText": "There hasn't been a game this immature since Conker's Bad Fur Day on the Nintendo 64. Bulletstorm is a balls to the wall first-person shooter that's a mixture of Duke Nukem 3D and Gears of War. It doesn't shoot for a story that you're going to golf clap afterwards, and it doesn't try to revolutionize the genre. What it does bring to the shooter genre is something the genre long forgot this generation: how to just have fun. It encourages brutal violence through a \"kill with skill\" system that gives you objectives to slaughter foes in certain ways. Bulletstorm will take you to the simpler times of the first-person shooter in a sci-fi atmosphere that is not only fun to look at, but fun to kill in.General Sarrano, apart of the Confederation of Planets, is the antagonist here and apart of the secret army, Dead Echo. He leads groups of soldiers into missions that slaughter innocent victims. Years ago our hero, Grayson Hunt, discovers he's been lied to so he decides to take revenge on Sarrano. Years after the event, alcoholic Grayson decides to fight a battle with hired mercenaries to battle Sarrano, only to end up crash landing (with Sarrano) on the planet Stygia. So now Grayson isn't only looking for revenge, but he's also trying to get off of this planet, which is filled with savages. Luckily, he'll have help with a Strogg-looking cyborg colleague, Ishi.As far as the story, it's pretty simple for the most part and is probably only there to keep the \"story crowd\" entertained. The story and dialog never take itself too seriously. During the story, you'll hear profanity spew out of their mouth, and a lot of sexually charged profanity. Don't worry; if you dislike strong language, you can mute most mature language in the options (along with turning the gore off). The innuendo isn't only limited to dialog. During your killings, you'll probably notice a few of them pop up on the screen after getting a skill kill, such as the \"Shocker\" or \"Gang Bang\". Aside from all of the silliness, the game's serious side actually could have been done without. The more goofy the game's dialog was, the more it fit with the actual game. But the seriousness and emotion they tried to put into the game every once in a while turned part of the game into what it was trying hard to parody.Despite all of the story, for better or worst, the game brings to the table what it promises: over-the-top gratuitous violence. The linear campaign will last about 6 hours, which seems to be the new average for shooters. It's also a very easy playthough, even on Very Hard. It's ultimately a cake walk that never feels too punishing. Through each act, you'll unlock new weapons and skill objectives after you've discovered the energy leash. The energy leash is your alternative attack that lashes out at an enemy and pulls them towards you, or with a power-up, will slam energy down to the earth and knock them high into the air for slow-motion killing. The slow-motion is really amazing and fun to play with. When you pull someone towards you, or kick them in the air, they're temporarily slowed down so you can get an easy kill with a headshot or something of that sort. Everything else will move in normal motion. But while an enemy if flying to him doom, you really get to pick how you kill your victim. You can kick them off the map, into spiked cacti or electricity, or just shoot them with your arsenal.The skill shots system is one of the key elements to the game. As mentioned above, a lot of the names for these are filled with innuendo, but all of them will make sense while you discover them. For example, the \"Rear Entry\" skill is performed by shooting an enemy in the butt until he dies. The list is incredible for the amount of damage you can inflict on enemies. The more weapons and upgrades you purchase from strategically placed drop shops (stores), the more skills you'll unlock. These skills are viewable by pressing select on your controller, so it's always there to check what skill you need to try next. Each time you discover a skill kill, you'll enjoy it each time. Not only will it increase your score drastically, you'll find it funny how you've discovered them. As stated, you'll buy new weapons to play around with, outside of the basic assault rifle, kick, and slide. Weapons range from explosive cannon balls to your base shotgun. Each of them have their own alternative attack, or charge attack. Each of these charge attacks unlock even more skills to shoot for (no pun intended).During my play through, I did run into a few glitches that really put a damper on the game's pace. During Act 4, I was rushing through the level to get to the boss quickly. When I arrived at the area I was lead to, I noticed the boss never spawned. I restarted the checkpoint, still nothing. I had to restart the chapter to actually get the game to load the boss correctly. There was also a few other glitches I ran into. My friendly AI team crowding me in a doorway and causing me to stick for a few moments in the door. However, for the most part, the game runs fine and doesn't really have any issues.The game is something to look at. It's vivid and colorful. Usually in a game like this, you'd expect the tone to be rustic, but the game is full of plant life, colorful destroyed cities, and that crimson spray from enemies. The game isn't a 1080p title, but it still looks great still. It might just be all the chaos or the sheer environments that is the true eye candy. You'll never experience a frame rate dip that causes you to miss a shot or anything. Bulletstorm runs smooth, and for this type of title, that's better than the visuals alone. Accompanied with great visuals is a great sounding game. The music is adrenaline pumping and the voice acting is key on. It's a complete package with it's eye and ear candy, not to disappoint the reasonable.When you're done with the campaign, you'll get to enjoy two different modes. Echoes is a time-trial run of Bulletstorm. You'll be challenged to try and pull off as many skill kills as possible, while rushing through a level. Each level (and then some) from the campaign is available to run through and try your shot at the leaderboards. If you happened to have played the demo, you'll understand how this mode is. The other mode you'll play through is Anarchy. Anarchy is much like the Horde play of Gears of War. It's wave after wave of enemies, each wave increasing the difficulty and amount of mini-bosses on the playing field. This mode can be played with a few friends, and the game encourages so by introducing enemies to \"Double Team\". When you \"Double Team\" an enemy, it requires you and a friend to perform certain skills to get more points. You can play Anarchy solo, but the key to this mode is playing it online.Bulletstorm is going to satisfy those awaiting Duke Nukem Forever (another title which is bringing old school shooters back), or just those who want a break from the modern warfare titles that are being milked right now. It's a lot of fun if you're not expecting game of the year material. It's a throwback to the past, a kick to the future, and it takes a shot at taking your gaming too seriously. If you play games for the fun of it, you'll find much pleasure in this title.+ Over-the-top shooter that's very retro and new in a sense.+ Anarchy mode is a blast.- Short and very easy campaign.- A few glitches that need to be patched out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Terrific Fun, Needs Real Multi Next Time", "unixReviewTime": 1315008000, "reviewTime": "09 3, 2011"}

Or if you don't like some immature dialog and gameplay. The only flaw in the game, to me, is that it's pretty short. But for the price, get it if you like FPS games!

It's an adrenaline-charged thrill-ride that plays with it's FPS mechanics, encouraging creativity on behalf of the player. Throw in a sharp story with an amusing sense of humor to boot and you have one of the most exciting FPS games in recent memory!'Bulletstorm' puts you in the role of Grayson Hunt, one of the dumbest (and funniest) FPS protagonists since Duke Nukem! Grayson's a former soldier turned space pirate who, through a wreckless (and intoxicated) act of revenge lands him on planet that was a former vacation resort and now overrun with monsters and criminals. With his surviving crew member and a stranded soldier named Trishka, Grayson and his comrades have to fight their way off planet while he tries for another shot at revenge. The story of Bulletstorm, despite it's low-brow sensibilites (and d*ck jokes) is actually very well thought-out and engaging and actually makes you interested in these characters and their story. The ending is a bit of a let-down (and predictable) but the narrative carries this game better than any other FPS I've played.While a good story and characters are a plus, they're nothing if the gameplay doesn't match. Thankfully, 'Bulletstorm' is just as fun to play as it is to listen to. There's the usual running and gunning mechincs, but added to this is an electric whip/grappling hook that allows you to latch on to enemies (and other objects) and combine them with your guns and melee attacks for some wacky kills. Everything in the gameplay can be used to creatively dispatch an enemy and 'Bulletstorm' actually rewards you points for your kills which you use to purchase upgrades and weapons. The more creative (and tasteless) the kill, the more points you get.The pacing and level design in 'Bulletstorm' is also exceptional. While the game progresses on a linear scale, the environments and enemies are designed for maximum effect, so much so that you practically feel like you're playing through an epic film. Even the scripted events give way to some of the most memorable and exciting levels I've ever seen in an FPS with a giant wheel of death and a remote-controlled dinosaur being the standouts!Unfortunately, while 'Bulletstorm' is entertaining right to the end (and never wears out it's welcome) it is a very SHORT game. I finished it at around six hours and that was taking my time to find collectables. I can see myself going back to it at some point but it's hard to recommend as a purchase.Even though 'Bulletstorm' will probably be a rental for most gamers, it is a title I recommend most people try out! The ending does give way for a sequel, but if EPIC games can create another game as entertaining and fun to play as this one then I'm all for it!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A wild and creative FPS!", "unixReviewTime": 1309046400, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2011"}

I was on the edge with this game because while the demo was lots of fun I couldn't imaging how they could make a decent game out of the concept of Style Point kills. I figured it would get old real fast.  Still I just had to try this out.  It was a bit of a new concept to shooters and boy is this refreshing!!GAMEPLAYThe meat and potatoes of this game.  Pretty much this is like any other shooter but with an edge.  Rather than just kill enemies, you kill them with style!  Leash an enemy to you, kick him in the face then pop his head off for +50 SP instead of a boring +10 for a kill.  Launch an enemy in the air and pull off a quick headshot with a pistol.  Kick a hotdog cart into someone to kill em, then blow it up taking out the rest of the mobs!  This game is about style and finding a myriad of ways to kill people.  I often found myself debating what weapons load out to chose towards the end simply because I wanted to be stylish; yet still try for tricks I had not unlocked yet. There are 2 tabs of \"general\" kills, and each weapon has its own set of stylish kills + 1 tab of hidden style kills you will try to figure out during the game.  Action is fast paced with little downtime and brings only the core elements of a shooter in with it.  There is no real fancy cover system or over the top weapon configuration options. This is just here is a gun... there are 8 baddies rushing you.  Kill em as stylish as possible. Kick em into spikes, throw em off a bridge, headshot, nut shot, throw em into electricity, a grinding wheel, a plant, electrified bugs.  Blow up some explosives and while they are on fire kill em.  Hit em in the face with a cannonball.  Pop a nutshut then kick em in the face :P  go for broke!GRAPHICS / SOUNDThe game graphics are actually quite amazing on the PS3.  The PC has the best graphics(no surprise there, my buddy picked it up for PC and it looks amazing).  The 360 seems to have just a \"slightly\" better graphics appearance than the PS3 but I am not surprised by that. This game was mainly developed on a 360.  The environments are well detailed, weapon detail is great. Coloring and visuals are nice with some pretty good physics.  *** Sound quality is exceptional.  The voice acting is very high quality and believable(despite being over the top), weapon sound effects are great as is ambient sounds in the game.  The sound track is also very killer especially the main menu them ^_^REPLAY / STORYThe storyline for this game is pretty simple but there is enough there to keep it entertaining.  It is obvious just from the first 10 minutes of the game the storyline is just added in there to give the game some flow and direction.  I personally enjoyed the storyline and the way characters interacted.  The campaign (normal difficulty) ran me around 7-8hrs.  About the same time as killzone 3 but part of that was I would restart sections to try and get some trophies on my first playthrough so you can expect more like 6 solid hours of gameplay from the campaign.*** REPLAY value, for me at least, is through the roof.  Not only is the campaign amazing; but the game tracks your stats so you could always try to beat your campaign run.  ONLINE offers Echoes and Anarchy mode  where ECHOES is pretty much running key parts of the SP campaign with a timer and score counter.  Higher you get your SP the cooler you look on the high scores chart.  ANARCHY is like horde mode.  You have waves of mobs and have to hit a certain amount of SP before advancing with your team. However you can't be a lone gunman with this mode; as there are a set # of mobs meaning you need to WORK AS A TEAM to achieve the scores and pull of team based skill moves.  If you get some people willing to work as a team this mode can be a lot of fun (or just get some friends together and try to last as long as you could)OVERALL (90% 9.0/A-)This game for me gets a 90%.  It is fantastic and for those who aren't to heavy into MP competition this is the perfect shooter to pick up.  While it can't compete with other MP shooters out there, it provides a fun and memorable campaign with over the top dialogue - and a MP element that has both competition and requires teamwork.  In my book, this is a must have title for any FPS fan period.  While this game isn't Killzone 3, Halo: Reach, Gears of War 2... it is a breath of fresh air that more than makes up for that and well deserving of a 5 star rating.* The only NEGATIVE I have about this game is the dialogue at times could be far to over the top and at times I did find myself getting stuck in textures(like I get hit by an explosion and it pushes me on-top of a texture and can't get down so I had to die/restart checkpoint)** LIMITED EDITION VERSION **It contains 25,000XP for multiplayer (you start at level 5), a silver leash color, a few skins for your character's gear, and additional Echoes maps (included with your online pass).  All the \"content\" provided by the Limited Edition is ONLINE ONLY.  The skins and such are only accessible as options for your multi-player character which kind of is a downer for me as the Silver Leash looks wicked cool. Would love to use it in the campaign.the 360 version of Bulletstorm - Limited Edition also comes with a Gears of War 3 beta invitation so if you enjoyed Gears of War and have a 360... try to get your hands on a LE version for free Beta access.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bulletstorm...this isn't your daddy's shooter!", "unixReviewTime": 1298764800, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2011"}

Lethal", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "While this game can draw no direct comparison with Duke Nukem, the unapologetic, in-your-face guns blazing style and bad attitude of the main character have a similar vibe.  There are enough reviews for me to skip the details so I'll stick to my own gameplay experience.I find the leash you use to grab enemies and draw them in to be effective, well implemented and generally fun.  It slows them in mid-air to set up skillshots and aim them for environmental kills.  The skillshots are many and some are easy to pull off while others demand precision or require certain conditions like something to impale an enemy on or getting two or more lined up to take out at once.There are unique weapons like the flail gun and drill that add variety to the gameplay, and each weapon can eventually have a charge shot added to it that does something different than the normal blast, such as the pistol having a flare shot that sets an enemy ablaze or sniper bullets that can be detonated on command once you have guided one into a target, allowing you to blow up him and any nearby enemies all at once, with all multi-enemy kills giving point bonuses.  When you fire the sniper rifle, you get a behind the camera view of the bullet in flight and control its path with the right stick, meaning you can even hit enemies hiding behind cover.There's a decent level of variety in the enemies, and the stages also change up just enough to allow numerous types of environmental kills.  Since creative kills yield more points to buy ammo and charge shots, all your sadism feels like it has a purpose.  Without giving anything away, there are some good boss fights, which is very rare for a FPS.  There's a ton of cursing, some of which involves phrases that don't even make sense, which even your character pokes fun at once.  While I don't find it adds to the game, it's not so blatant as to get on my nerves.Online frag-fests bore me to tears so I can't speak to the online experience.I'm a gamer who rips on most FPS's for all being the same, but there's definitely enough originality to justify picking this one up, especially now that the price has dropped.

At times it did feel a little repetitive. Since skillshots are unlocked while playing levels. That means you cannot do them untill they are unlocked. You can try but you won't get the points for them.If you go in there shooting everything in site, you will waste your bullets and end up dying or wasting money trying to buy more bullets.

{"reviewerID": "A369KP0JV77JYT", "asin": "B003H0CBYS", "reviewerName": "Jon", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "*Single player campaign review only*I think this is a game where it's best to just list the pros and cons, rather than a summary.Pros:1. Great set of weapons.  Very few weapons overall, but considering a great deal of the game is strategy in how to effectively take out the enemies, it works well and each weapon is unique to the others and seems to have it's own type of \"personality\".  The thing I liked a lot was the incorporation of \"skillshots\" - points for different methods of dispatching the enemy.  The more unique, the more skill points you'd get, and thus the more you could upgrade your weapons.  This made it interesting and unique in terms of how much it felt useful to conserve ammo.  It was rarely that there wasn't enough ammo, it was much more that you wanted to conserve to try and do interesting moves.  Segueing into,2. apart from your weapons you have some unique skills.  The traditional \"melee\" is now more of a \"kick\" feature, where you kick a guy and it slows down time so you can continue to dispatch him however you want.  You also have a \"leash\" which is perhaps the heart and soul of this game.  You can pull things to you, activate things, pull enemies to you, and eventually use it as a weapon.  Finally related to the melee is the ability to \"slide\" - it's basically a slide tackle move where again it slows down time but also can be used to attack enemies from a distance to quickly get up close.3. I was expecting a brainless shooter with a lot of interesting ways to kill guys, but I actually was kept very much in the game with the overall storyline.  It is a bit cliche, perhaps, but still enjoyable, and the plot does develop the characters and story much better than you think it will.  The story kept moving and never slowed which was nice.4. I was quite impressed with the graphics.  Seemed really well done.  At one point you're battling a city-sized beast and the scope is amazing.5. Considering the recent slew of EXTREMELY short games I've purchased (Medal of Honor, Homefront, COD Black Ops) this one was more like Kill Zone 3 in terms of a better length.  Certainly felt long enough for me to be happy.Cons:1. Game was very very linear.  It was something you could look past since there was always something going on, but besides the occasional little area you could hunt around for ammo boxes, it was completely a straight path.2. The enemies were quite repetitive.  I don't know how to emphasize this more, but while a few different types emerged at later points in the game, you did feel at times like it was the same thing over and over and over and over.  I mean this is an iffy critique for any FPS, since I don't know what they're supposed to do to combat this type of thing, but it definitely felt like you were basically facing few different enemies total.3. You have to choose three weapons out of your entire stash to be able to carry at a time.  This was frustrating because I ended up basically just using three different weapons (machine gun, pistol, & sniper rifle) since I didn't know what the other weapons could do exactly and never seemed to have a moment where I'd be able to get them down before using them.  Bulletstorm has a quick-cycle thing to choose your weapon, but I have played other games where you can cycle through all of them at any time and the gameplay stops while you're doing so.  Of course many games these days only allow you to carry a light and heavy weapon period.Random thoughts:1. Sniper rifle \"bullet time:\" basically you pull the trigger, the bullet heads towards the enemy, then it switches to a slowed down bullet time where you can direct the bullet.  This was both cool and frustrating.  The effect was cool, but I found until I was able to upgrade the weapon it was very hard to actually hit guys - they'd always jump out of the way of the bullet a little too intelligently.  The sniper rifle later becomes much more useful to me when you can make additions to the type of ammo.2. Your computer teammates are pretty much indifferent to your quest, which I think is good after playing games where they are too important and thus can screw up your own methodology to FPS.  They help sometimes but never get in the way, which is nice enough.3. In response to the amount of cussing people mentioned in other comments, it is no worse then half the other games out there.  Yes there is an ample amount, but never so much you're distracted by it.  Some of it is even amusing.  If it's distracting when you hear bad words then don't buy mature rated games.  The cussing works with the dialogue.Bottom-line:  I would say this is worth the cost resoundingly if you're a fan of just fun first person shooters, regardless of how realistic it is or if it's part of a series.  But if you don't like alien-shooting games maybe you wouldn't be happy with it.  I felt like it is well worth the money - I bought it on an Amazon sale at I think $39.99, and I am very happy with my purchase.  It is an original game, with original components, and I think in terms of it being FUN you will be happy with your purchase.  It does get repetitive at times, which was why I rated it four stars instead of five overall.  But it was a nice pick-me-up after having dropped $60 on the disappointing Homefront game.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Loads of fun, original for a FPS these days", "unixReviewTime": 1301184000, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2011"}

Basically this is what video games should be, a lot of fun and an enjoyable escape from reality. I also must add, there is a lot of cursing, however after you get into the game it really just becomes background noise and you really don't notice it much. The violence aspect is over the top, but in a very animated sense, kind of like a grownups version of Looney Tunes.Surprisingly, the story isn't that bad. I'm not sure if it's because I wasn't really expecting much because of the type of game it is or if it was actually a good story on its own merits, but either way the bottom line is it was pretty good. There was just as much action as there was character development, you actually felt as if you were fighting for something and someone at the same time.The AI is as dumb as a box of rocks, not really much of a challenge. This game really wasn't meant to blow you away with incredible AI, they were meant to be used as target practice and nothing more.

I will tell you though; the multiplayer portion is a lot more fun with friends than it is with random people. You will be entertained, but I don't know if you'll spend Call of Duty hours playing online here in the Bulletstorm world.If I could compare this game to anything else currently on the market, it would be a mash up of MadWorld, Gears of War and Borderlands, and if you ask me borrowing elements from those titles isn't a bad thing at all. If you're looking for a good time, nothing too serious, pick this game up, you won't be disappointed.By the way, in case you were wondering, the title is an inside joke for Xbox 360 players.Michael", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The only time when seeing the \"red ring of death\" isn't a bad thing!", "unixReviewTime": 1298505600, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2011"}

It looked like a decent shooter that was reminiscent of most FPS games. I thought it might be a lot like Borderlands (which would not be a bad thing...Borderlands was awesome!), based on the \"points\" received for well-executed shots, along with the ability to upgrade equipment and/or abilities along the way. In that sense, it really is like Borderlands. But it's really a very different game overall...and not in a bad way. It's got its own identity, and a very high fun factor.The good:+The skillshot system is awesome. You can play the game like any other shooter, if you want, and ignore the skillshots altogether. But it's so much more fun if you embrace the skillshots and pursue them. Note that not all of these are actually \"skill\" based, so that's a bit of a misnomer. For example, one of them is to get a kill by shooting or kicking someone into a high voltage fence. This doesn't really require any skill...just taking advantage of the right timing and use of the environment. Some of them ARE skill-based, though, and even the ones that aren't don't make them any less fun to pursue. Watching a guy get frizzled on an electric fence is pretty cool, even if it doesn't really require me doing anything specific to make it happen.+Along with the skillshot system is the upgrade system. You can upgrade your equipment and (to a lesser extent) abilities (things like health and so forth). This is very cool, and gives the game a bit more depth than most shooters. It also give you a little bit more incentive to pursue the various skillshots.+The graphics are actually pretty good. Colorful, detailed environments, many of which can be used with the skillshot system, and the effects are quite well-done.+The story is actually pretty good. It's completely absurd and over the top, but not necessarily in a bad way. If you don't go in expecting a riveting story, it's actually a pretty good premise. I won't spoil any of it, but it's got a decent antagonist who you really love to hate.+The length of the single player campaign is awesome for a FPS, especially compared to other recent shooters (COD games, for example, which are offensively short for the single player campaign). The SPC should take at least 8 hours for most players, and if you try to go for the skillshots, it will take even longer. The combat doesn't get repetitive because of the skillshot system.+The sound design is excellent. Effects on shots and environmental takedowns is great, the music is very cool. The only downside of the sound is the laughable voice acting, which can get grating after a while, but it does go along with the over the top story.+The \"fun\" factor. This game is just plain fun. It's frantic, hectic, and loud. Lots of energy and a fast pace throughout. Sometimes I wished that it would slow down a little bit for some contrast, and while that happened a slight bit, it didn't seem like enough. That said, though, this is also in line with the over-the-top nature of the whole game. The skillshots are loads of fun, and I just had a blast with this one. Very well done.The bad:-The game is very linear. Definitely an \"on rails\" kind of game. And by that, I mean it's VERY linear. When linear is done really well, it's not noticeable at all (like the Uncharted games - very linear, but I never felt like I was being pushed along a particular path in those). Here the linear nature of the game didn't really bother me much, because the skillshot system kept things fresh throughout, but I was definitely aware that it was linear throughout most of the game. You are pushed along singular corridors...and pushed, and pushed. There is almost no variation in approach to different areas, enemies, etc.-The user interface is somewhat confusing and unhelpful. It lists the various skillshots, but without any seeming purpose. It doesn't tell you how to accomplish those skillshots, nor does it clearly identify which ones you've successfully achieved and which you have yet to go. Many of the skillshots are only unlocked as you progress through the game, or as you perform other skillshots, but it's not clear which ones are new. Fortunately, this didn't seem to hamper the game or the skillshot system, but it could have added something to the game that wasn't, and it seems like a missed opportunity.-Language. SO MUCH CURSING. Why is this kind of language necessary? Some of the quips were funny, once. But they repeat the same jokes and foul language, over and over and over. It does go with the over the top story, but it's just not necessary, and would have been a much better game without it.Overall:This game is loads of fun. A more open-world format, a better UI, and FAR less foul language would have made it near perfect. Here's hoping for a sequel that addresses some of these issues, but the game is definitely recommended for FPS fans.Gameplay - 8/10Plot/Story - 6/10Graphics - 7/10Sound - 6/10Length - 8/10Fun - 9/10Overall - 8.5/10 (not an average)NOTE: I didn't include anything about the coop or multiplayer aspects of the game, because I never play multiplayer at all...ever...so I couldn't care less about it, and can't speak to it.

From a campaign perspective, I think Bulletstorm is hands-down a better game than Black Ops.  BTW, I play a lot of Black Ops and, for the most part, I think it's a better game than reviews indicate.Anyway, Bulletstorm is tons of fun to play.  I'm not much of a sci-fi guy but the story is good and the action is a blast.  Kicking guys into cacti, leashing an enemy to pull him into a metal gate and impale him on a piece of rebar...awesome!  The variety of ways you can kill never gets old.  I adapted very easily to the controls and the physics of the game and am easily able to switch between this and other shooters without any problem.  If I were judging strictly on campaign, I would give this game 5 stars without question.Unfortunately, the multiplayer is quite lacking.  If the Treyarch guys put too much into multiplayer and not enough campaign, the developers of Bulletstorm are guilty of the opposite.  It's fun to play but there is only one mode (Anarchy) and no way you can actually battle other players.  It's just a team of players going against AI enemies.  Like I said, it's fun but pretty weak considering the competition out there in the FPS genre and it gets boring pretty quickly.  I bought Black Ops in November of last year and I still play the online multiplayer.  I still play games that are 2 or 3 years old because of multiplayer but I don't suspect the case will be the same with Bulletstorm.  I will probably play the campaign through one more time on a harder than normal difficulty and shelve it.I disagree with the reviewer who claimed that this game is all about shock value because of some coarse language.  There are about 5 R-rated movies released in any given week with more coarse language than this game.  Even if you are offended by foul language, it's incorrect to say that this game is about shock value, there is some definite substance here from a gamer's perspective, I'd just like to see them take the multiplayer further.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "This game is ALL ABOUT FUN...but multiplayer sucks", "unixReviewTime": 1298937600, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2011"}

The story is not fine literature,  but then again it's a FPS.  If you want a story driven game this is not the right place to look for it,  I am aware other games have story and action but this game is not trying to do that,  It is not like they shot for something and missed,  they aimed at a specific goal and made it.The graphics and good,  and the game play is engaging as well,  the skill points aspect of the game is fun, and not as repetitive as I thought when I looked at the reviews,  it is all based on how you play the game,  if you change up the weapons frequently then it is not that big of an issue,  if you use the same three guns the entire game it will be an issue.I am extremely disappointed in the multiplayer function,  I have a good internet connection at my house, and this game kept saying some odd message about something or other not being properly set so I would have trouble hosting a game,  I have not had this issue with any other game I have played or owned, so I am a little confused,  also I have gone back to older games that I enjoyed playing online,  Resistance two is one of my all time favorites,  it came out a while back and has a lot of features,  Games are supposed to progress and develop new features,  all games have lets say a death match or team death match,  one of the recent halo games has something called Horde which is basically the only multiplayer function in Bulletstorm.  Resistance Two has all those other multiplayer plus team based missions that change up every time you play a map, so that no two times are the same really,  the objectives in each mission and they change up so that you have a unique experience.  None of that in this game,  it is the same thing every time,  you have to play with a certain number of people, and you have to gain skill points by killing enemies,  but the maps I have played on were so small that the other people kept killing people right before I tried to,  We were fighting over enemies to kill... Lame.I am giving this game three stars for that reason,  EA is going to charge people who buy the game used ten dollars to use the online features,  or just to play the story mode,  not sure if you can just play offline.  But that is really unfair to consumers,  first to charge them, but also because the content is not working as well as it should,  the one multiplayer match I got into was glitchy, and they decided that the best place to put a warning about internet connection was in the center of the screen,  I was playing and right in the middle of the screen was \"internet connection bad\" or something like that in big black letters,  not cool.  So The only thing that you really get is a single type of multiplayer game, where you work with other players to fight a bunch of bad guys,  to get points and your ranked when you play echos,  that does not seem worth charging people who want to buy a used copy ten dollars.  They should have put in the other standard multiplayer games,  Death Match, Capture the Flag, and so on, as well as team based for the same thing.  They could have been more creative, then using something that is basically a multiplayer version of the game in a smaller level, Resident Evil 5 added Versus, but they charged players,  if games are going to be adding multiplayer DLC that seems really wrong,  I will bet anyone that they release DLC and the download will be super small because like some other games,  it will just release content on the game disc.Also people who have complained about the language should know that you can turn it off in the main menu,  you can also turn off blood and gore.This game should have been better in terms of the multiplayer,  because that is how most people get hours out of a game,  but this games multiplayer functions are super lame,  and non creative,  I mean just off the top of my head they could have used the gravity boots from the first five seconds of the game to do a sky scrapper death match, where your running around a building,  they could have had a death match where not only do you have to survive but you have to make your way through a collapsing building a very popular theme in the game,  expanding on that they could have a team based version where one team has to keep you from escaping and destroying the building.  That took me two minutes,  the game developers had a lot more time to give players a really fun multiplayer experience, and instead they gave us one lousy mode that hardly works,  and they expect people who buy used games to pay ten dollars to be able to play it, as well as not being able to play on multiple platforms,  the days of games making it easier to go play at a friends house or lend games is being destroyed by EA.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not A Bad Game, But Not A Great Game", "unixReviewTime": 1299283200, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2011"}

I have to say that even given those constraints, I was pleasantly surprised.For a start, it IS stupid fun.  The dialogue is b-movie rogue hero stuff and progress is linear and direct, with no bother with an open world/roam anywhere playing field.Simple, yes, but the first surprise came with the highly polished gameplay.  Controls are fluid and instantly familiar.  Character movement is smooth and aiming is easy.  Fun and combat variety come from the \"leash,\" \"thumper,\" kicking, and sliding mechanics.  Leash an enemy and yank them toward you, and they float in slow motion for a few moments while you kick or shoot them to pieces.  The skill-based kill system is fun, encouraging you to be creative.  What they also got right is they don't make it impossible to do this by overrunning you with hoards of enemies.  While combat is well paced, you still have time to try out those various kills.  The more creative you are, the more points you earn.  Some of the skills are comical too (kill a burner by shooting his butt), and the whole game has a carefree, lighthearted feel to it.But the biggest surprise is the graphics.  Some reviews here say they are so-so, but with a mere 720p HD LCD the environments are, gasp, really beautiful.  I didn't expect this at all, but the vistas are just gorgeous.  The environments are non-repetitive, very well detailed, and varied.  You won't see pieces of wall design repeated all over the place.  They are also accurate, in the sense that what you see from a given vantage point is what you played through earlier, not just a generic canvas.  For example, standing on a huge dam, in the distance you can see the collapsed railroad bridge that you fell from earlier, and the ground way down on your right looks like what you played through to get where you are now.You get the usual doses of variety.  There's the mounted-gun-on-a-train section (with the truly awesome sight of a huge turbine rolling along behind you), and a great section where you get to control a big mechanical dinosaur - laser beam eyes! - to mow down enemies.  How many games let you control a big dinosaur in a future amusement park?  Hilarious fun and every little boys' dream.It's definitely not a little boy's game, though.  Language and violence are very adult.Although I haven't quite finished it yet (I'm close to the end of the single-player campaign), I'm pleasantly surprised.  The game may not take itself too seriously, which is part of what makes it so fun, but the developers definitely DID take it seriously.  They may have set out to make a stupid-fun shooter with an ingrown silliness (like drinking the booze bottles you find and getting drunk for a few seconds), but that didn't stop them from taking their jobs very seriously.  Solid controls, beautiful graphics, no glitches to speak of, and the combat system all more than make up for the lack of story.

Controlling the sniper rifle was new since I suck with sniper rifles and this made it interesting. Same with using the leash. I did find it hard to buy ammo for all the weapons, I stuck to just a few weapons I like. But the game was still not that hard at all and I was able to beat it in 6 hours. Problem is there's really nothing to do after you beat it. Unlike other games were you can go into multiplayer and just start blasting other people. The multiplayer here is just you in a party of 4 fighting waves of enemies. The issue here is I really don't know anyone else with the game so you got to partner with random people who might not care about team work. Plus I had a hard time connecting just to start a game so I just didn't bother trying. The \"Echoes\" mode is just you going through the single player game again trying to get the most skill points as possible. So nothing really new there. The leashed might have been the issue for a deathmatch multiplayer game mode, but couldn't they disable that for multiplayer?  Anyways this was a fun game for the 6 hours I played it, but there is no lasting appeal and I probably should have rented this instead. In face I recommend everyone else to just rent it, don't waste your $60. My friends were asking me if they should get it, I told them I'm done and they can just borrow it. There's an online code like all EA games, but single player is all they need. Based on the ending, there will definitely be a sequel, I hope they add a better multiplayer mode.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fun game, but doesn't last.", "unixReviewTime": 1298851200, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2011"}

Bulletstorm starts out with you, Grayson, drunk off your a** trying to get information out of a prisoner. Then you start going through the basic movement mechanics of the game to get a feel for it. The witty remarks that are made by Grayson are off the wall and very hilarious. This game flows very well is graphically decent looking...but its gameplay and story are what set it apart.Grayson and his team of Dead Ops were sent out to perform hit missions coming to find out the people they were killing were actually innocent civilians trying to expose the Confederation of heinous crimes. Grayson decides to rebel against them and become a pirate destroying any and all Confederate ships he runs into. Then, one day, drunk off his a** he finds, the main ship with the general who betrayed him on it. So being completely smashed he does the logical thing, starts attacking it wildly with a turret. He succeeds in bringing it down along with his ship on a semi-deserted planet. That is where the story begins...and I am not giving up anymore than that.When it comes to gameplay and combat...this game does it well. A decent variety of weapons with a regular attack and a charge attack. You can upgrade the ammo clips and charged attacks as well. The fun part of this game is doing the different skills. Everynight I am sitting there thinking of new ways to lay these idiots out. Favorite has to be the flail gun (explosive attachment) then kick them into a group of enemies...AWESOME!!! You are going to have a lot of fun doing the different things in this game, I guarantee it.This game is worth its price tag, have not been online with it yet but it has a variety of play modes and kind of a beat the score mode as well.

A nice addition.ConsNo co-op campaign. I realize this may not work with the whole \"kill with skill\" gimmick, but its not a good excuse to not have it, in my opinion.Poorly implemented Anarchy Mode. Although the concept is great, and I still play horde mode a couple of times a week, they really dropped the ball here. They rush you between rounds when you have to purchase your weapons, upgrades and ammo. They give you 30 seconds and then that's it, you have to wait until the next round. Why put a time limit on this?Many times the combinations don't execute properly or you aren't awarded the points even when you do exactly what you were supposed to.Only a handful of maps doesn't help any at all. I know that its probably difficult to make maps for a game like this because of all the interactive elements on each level, but they should have had a few more.I enjoyed the campaign and the anarchy mode will provide you with a few hours of enjoyment, but you'll soon tire of the kill with skill gimmick.

Even the sniper rifle was cool as I kept missing not realizing they move after you shoot and you get to aim the slomo bullet in flight and it's not as easy as it seems to get a hit - whats cooler is if you hit an explosive target to burn the enemies instead as body shots get you a paltry 10 points.Also, be forewarned that there are periods where the game has some glitches where you may be suspended in a region that you cannot escape or get locked into the scenery and your left with no choice but to restart a checkpoint or chapter unfortunately.  I would guess during each playthrough twice it occurred about 2-3 times but during about 8-10 hours gamelay simply meant some do over killing.Been playing FPS since Doom was a shareware piece, and a big fan of Serious Sam Series and EDF and love the simplicity and while you can do the easy level fairly quick it offers up the Echo challenges and the game much more difficult.  This is no Borderlands where an addiction factor with collecting weapons and DLC's that can keep you busy for months and months through two tiers and 69 levels but it can be intense, challenging, and IMO humorous as can be the way it's presented.  You'll finish it quickly on easy and just getting used to the skill kills and want to play again since you may be just getting used to how to use many of the weapons since you have to earn money to buy up and ordinary kills equal very little to buy the real kick-butt weapons and charges.Got my copy for free and love these type $20-$30 budget games but realize this title is truly an \"M\" rated title folks and it's strictly kill as quickly and creatively as you can and proceed forward - this is not Borderlands GOY edition addiction but in some cases it's more intense in quick spurts versus wandering a massive map of Borderlands and honing your addiction to the weapons collection and crazy time spent surviving all the Underdome challenges and just one of those 20 levels of five in three arenas takes far longer and harder than this entire game - the Underdome DLC took me months to survive them all at Tier 2 whereas this game will be done in a day or two at easy.  Different beast altogether but well worth the money IMO.

The main story is pretty short (I'd guess around 6-8 hours though I'm not sure) and there's really no other modes to sink your teeth into. There's a challenge mode where you can join your friends and essentially play small portions of levels. However, with no competitive aspect and little variety it quickly becomes boring.The story is a relatively generic jock sci-fi throwaway which ends up taking place solely in a blown up theme park. The game is very vulgar, but in a childish way where it's so stupid it's kind of funny. However other times it comes back around and you're left just shaking your head. The leash is an interesting gaming weapon, but it is very simplistic, allowing for very limited attacks and experimentation. Most effective attacks boil down to leash a guy to you (unless they're \"too fast\" which was annoyingly ridiculous) kick them away and blow of their head. The guns you get are pretty cool, but with very limited ammo most of the time and only two weapon spots the fun is limited. Also, the coolest part of the weapons, getting a new one and trying it out on a bunch of baddies, ends around 3/4 of the way through.The whole point system is very interesting, with how the leash gives him the hud and points for effective play resulting in ammo and weapon upgrades, but at the same time it gives points for things that break the idea. For example groin shots (dude, you just don't shoot another guy in the d*ck), getting drunk, and killing insects. Why not just get rid of all the pretense and make a wicked awesome game, who cares if it does or doesn't make sense.Finally, I had a multitude of glitches, the worst being a game breaking glitch where I had to restart the whole level. Along with that large glitch (of which I've heard there are many other gamebreaking glitches, mostly involving your AI partner getting stuck) there are many other smaller ones, for example some of the animations/challenges not activating when they should (especially for nut shots).In the end, this game is essentially a placeholder for Gears of War 3.

This was Bungie's big goal, to create 30 seconds of fun for the gamer, and then let him do it again and again. And it worked - Halo is arguably one of the greatest FPS franchises in the business!However, without fail, the same thing could be said for just about EVERY shooter out there. Point, shoot, reload, point, shoot, reload... Still fun though, right?People Can Fly and Epic Studios have done just that with their new opus, Bulletstorm. Only, this time, they added a couple new wrinkles to that 30 seconds; a nifty new tool, the tether; and a carnival house devoted to pain! Just about everywhere one looks in Bulletstorm, one sees something they wouldn't want to get too close to in real life - cactus covered in deadly spikes, exposed electrical wiring, man-eating plants, etc. Each of these things are designed to be used by the player to rack up crazy combinations of over the top violence visited upon the bodies of maniacal (and most probably cannibalistic) muties out to kill you. The more you manage to wring out of a combo, the more points you get. However, since points in Bulletstorm equate to cash, and cash is what you need to buy more ammo and upgrades for your fabulously twisted weapons arsenal, it behooves the player to be as creative in his kills as he possibly can. This \"skillshot system\" is what changes everything - People Can Fly obviously love video-games, and it shows in a perfectly balanced system designed to reward player creativity with bigger and better toys...One example is the flailgun, a weapon you find early on that shoots spiked grenades connected by a chain like a sadistic bolo, perfect for tying up a foe which you can then use to fling into a group of his buddies before remotely setting off the explosives, multiplying your skillshot count by the overall amount of enemies. If any of them end up stuck to a cactus, or slamming up against an explosive barrel, you get credit for those things, too! All these seemingly disparate mini-atrocities add up to one big score, which the player can then use to buy themselves something nice from the store. And since every item in the store is a weapon or something weapon-related, that \"something nice\" is definitely gonna be something you like. This, of course, is just one small example - not only does each weapon have a secondary mode, they also have their own specific skillshots to unlock inspiring the player to use each weapon in ways he may never have thought about before!As for re-playability, Bulletstorm has that in spades. Playing thru the campaign opens up challenge areas you can take on separately by yourself, or with a couple of friends (the main campaign has co-op as well!). Your scores are kept track of and placed on the gamerboards for everyone else to see. The better you get at manipulating each one of these spaces, squeezing out more and more skillshot points, the better you end up being in the campaign upon every consecutive play-thru. In the end, the experience is akin to billiards - the better you get at it, the more satisfying the experience. And with graphics this good, and characters this fun to hang out with, you're gonna want to get better...On the subject of multi-player, results can be mixed. If you're playing with friends with a common goal, you're gonna have a lot of fun. If you're playing with strangers, you're probably not gonna have any fun at all as most of the gameplay relies on mutual cooperation and good communication.

Thankfully I did not have the same experience and I actual got into the game. In the game you will be playing as the character, Gray, a super soldier who goes rogue with the rest of his group. Several years after going rogue he sees the chance to take down the man who sent them on all those missions and decides to basically kamikaze the other's ship. Amazingly enough some people survived, you (of course), the man you want to kill, and a couple of others, but you have crashed on this planet. The planet is in disarray and there are gangs that roam the streets looking for control of all that is there. You'll have to fight your way through them if you want to have a chance at getting back at Saranno, the main who sent you on all the missions that you hate yourself for.Graphically this game looks pretty good, there's a couple of locales that you'll get to see through the game, and the character design for the different factions definitely give them a unique look, but then to fill the screen with bad guys its all cut and paste. There are a couple graphical hiccups in the cut scenes where certain things don't completely render, but overall the graphics stand up for this fact paced game.I couldn't tell you one thing about the music in the game, it just didn't stand out. What did stand out was the voice acting, there were quite a few voices in there that left me feeling like I had heard them before. The dialog was above and beyond cheesy, but I think for the most part I was able to forgive the game for it.The controls for the game definitely took a couple scenes before I really got a handle on them. Once I got the controls down, though, man I had a lot of fun quickly attacking, switching weapons, using the electronic tether, and kicking enemies into highly fatal situations. There was also the sliding mechanic of double tapping 'A' that definitely created some interesting scenarios.Overall this game, in my opinion, was made to rack up a high score. Its basically a game in which you want to be inventive on how you dispose of your opponent, and the game definitely gives you some environmental help in that area with large cactus, steep drops, foot carts, highly explosive containers, spinning blades, electric-charged cables, and more. Shooting the crap out of your enemy, then pulling them to you with the tether, then kicking them away, shooting them some more, and then watching them impale yourself can definitely have its moments of utter bliss, and also cause lots of points to pile up. Now there is a reason for the points, they will be used to upgrade your weapons, possibly unlock new ones, and reload your ammo reserves. You can also change what three guns you currently have equiped. For me personally I had the machine gun, the sniper rifle, and the shotgun, and I was hell on wheels with that combo. The game does try to get you to use all the weapons so that you can unlock all the special combos that will bring in the big bucks the first time you successfully do the required action, but after a while I kind of just stuck with what felt comfortable. Fighting your way through all those enemies can at times be really enjoyable, and sometimes frustrating because you will have cleared a section of a room or area, and then as you're trying to spot up to take on some enemies on the other side of the room all of a sudden more enemies appear at your back. So make sure you're protected when using the sniper rifle. That reminds me the sniper rifle is a very unique experience not only do you sight your target but you also control the bullet, apparently everyone in the game, minus you, has beyond human reaction time, so you're going to have to steer the bullet into the opponent if you actually want to hit them, otherwise you're going to miss almost every time unless you're trying to take on one of the bigger characters who can take a couple of rounds without falling. I did have one huge glitch happen to me in one of the levels where I somehow got so far ahead of my CPU companions that I couldn't progress any further, so my advice to you is that whenever you're taking an elevator make sure they are with you, if they are not you might have to replay an entire level all over again.With all the cheesiness and the arcady feeling I still really like the game. Yes it set itself up for a sequel, yes there's probably areas that could be improved, but at the end of the day if you're just looking to blow off steam and destroy enemies Rambo style, with some added flair, this is the game for you. This game gets an 8.3 out of 10.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Bulletstorm Review", "unixReviewTime": 1324339200, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2011"}

I wanted to leave a review based on the demo and update when I got the game, but I waited.Fast forward to today. I have been counting the last few days down till release day and then I had to wait till after dinner to play because I had to help my kids do some stuff after school. Needless to say I was chomping at the bit. I put the game in and downloaded it to my hard drive as I ate dinner, so it would be ready when I was.This game is so amazing!

All this is just a set up for the games real feature... KILL WITH SOME SKILL!!Every weapon you you possess gives you a new way to kill the enemy. Every weapon combines with every other weapon to give you ways to kill the enemy. Now for the truely genius thing about KILL WITH SKILL, you earn points for each type of skilled kill that allow you to upgrade your weapons, buy new weapons and buy ammo to allow you to get new ways to KILL WITH SKILL. You even get environment skill kills depending on where you are in the story, plus you get skill points for being quick to look at the story elements the game wants you to see by pressing the left trigger quick. I am having a blast hustling thru the game at an advanced pace and getting my points for KILLING WITH SKILL. I laugh at the names of the kills and try for the harder ones continually (harder skill kills earn bigger points). The coolest part about the skill kills is that when they are unlocked, they tell you how to achieve them. No guessing, just more KILLS WITH SKILLS.I have not played the multi-player yet, but I am glad that it has both co-op and multi-player. When I do play some multi-player I will edit my review with the new info. A little side note about the game, I like that for no more cost, I got the Epic Edition by pre-ordering which gave me some cool multi-player bonuses (couple of skins, new leash color and 25,000 bonus experience to start muli-player with). I am actually glad they they didn't give me some over powered weapon that took the challenge out of the campaign portion of the game.

Allen", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewText": "I'd like to compare Bullet Storm with Duke Nukem mostly because it's over the top and attempt to take seriousness out of the game and put in intense violent action with funny colorful dialogs.Storyline ~I like to think that the developers were aiming for a 1980s style B-rated film plot line. For those of you who don't know, 1980's b-rated movies were generally gems where funny one liner dialogs and corny plots occur while trying to be serious but being extremely funny.The story of Bullet Storm puts you in the role of character who is trying to seek revenge. The character is part of a team who had orders from a general who told them to assassinate people they thought were terrorists but it turned out that the general only wanted to kill people trying to expose the truth about their government. The point is the story is ridiculous and silly.The game has it where you shoot down the general's warship, but your ship was badly damaged as well. You land on a planet that happens to be a resort planet, but somehow it was overrun by violent gangs and mutants. The entire game has it where you're to try and exact a revenge on the general.Many funny dialogs and plot are exchanged as you advance the story. I won't give away much but then there isn't really that much to say other than it's corny and silly and very unrealistic but it has its share of funny moments.Graphics ~The graphics of Bullet Storm is beautiful. As I said earlier, you're in a resort planet so you're going to see many wonderful tropical places as well as inner city surrounding a beautiful place. However, I've noticed sometimes when you think a place is beautiful, if you zoom in, you can see that they're not actually objects, but pictures that the developer trick you into thinking that it's a far off scenery. That isn't really distracting unless you take the time to really pay close attention.As far as your character graphics, there are so problems. While the graphics is wonderful, from time to time, the gun on your characters back may \"bounce\" or \"distort\" for a second. It doesn't happen often, but it does happen from time to time.Gameplay ~The game is set as a 1st person shooter. You do get one scene where you actually get to shoot from a space ship, but otherwise you're stuck in the 1st person view. The cut scenes tend to have it where you're viewing the characters in 3rd person, but sometimes you see scenes unfold in 1st person. Doesn't totally matter.The environment in this game is sort of confusing from time to time. You don't have \"free roam\" in areas. What I mean is, for example, you can't jump off a rail. Even more so, you can't freely move. While the environment may appear to be open and unlimited, you can't actually move around. You have to follow a set area and sometimes and invisible wall may block you from doing something. I recall one part near the end, you have a lot of \"free roaming\" but yet when you think you can go into an area, an invisible wall sort of blocks you from going to that area even though you can see an opening.You don't get that much of a weapon selection. You get guns and all of them has a primary fire mode and something called a \"charge\" shot which is basically like a secondary fire mode that cost you a \"charge\" that you can upgrade. You also get this thing called a whip, which is used to pull enemies out on the open. You can also you a charge shot on the whip which causes a lot of people to fly into the air at an radius. I found that most of the weapons are boring to use. They have some good ones like a grenade launcher, but it isn't fun at all. I found the best weapons are the standard machine rifle, pistol and the sniper rifle. The sniper rifle is probably the funniest weapon to use as you can navigate the round to the target. It's quite fun but again the AI behavior is the same. Like for example, if you use a sniper rifle, start steering it towards the enemy, he'll slow motion dodge it but once you figure out the pattern it's very easy because the enemy always does the same exact pattern.To get upgrades and ammo/charge shot purchases, you have to have point. Each time you kill an enemy, you get this thing called \"skill shots\" points. For example, if you just plainly shoot someone, you'll get really low points. But if you kick someone to a spiked fence, you get more points. You can compound it like for example, you can whip someout out in the open, kick them to a spiked fence then you get bonus points. It's fun at first, but sort of gets boring at the end when you realize every option is pretty much exhausted. In some cases you can kick these funny looking hats on people, or even shoot a plant that causes mass hysteria. You can even drink booze or inhale the mass hysteria plant and get bonus points by being in an intoxicated state. It's quite fun.There are problems executing the skill shots. For example, some places have decent barrels laying around. So if you \"aim down the sight\" sometimes the auto aim follows someone running off in the distance. So you miss the skill shot chance and now you're stuck having to find another way. It's rather annoying to have the auto aim lock onto something you don't intend to shoot. This can be bypassed though. I've learned that if you want to do this, don't aim down the sight. Instead hip fire and perhaps waste some rounds trying to do something that should have been done easily by aiming down the sights.Also, you get two AI partners in this game. While they appear hardcore in cut scenes, they don't really help out in game. They run around and from time to time may just run past enemies. I don't recall any AI saving me in the game. Matter of fact, they just randomly run around and take cover and so fort. Personally I like it where they don't help, but sometimes it's a wonder why they're so \"dumb\" yet in scenes they appear so different.Some of the boss battles in the game are excellent. I recall this one plant boss, and I never had so much fun fighting a boss. It's fun and exciting. However, that is pretty rare. I think that is the only large boss of the game. Plus one train level, you had to dodge a giant tire while escaping which was extremely fun and exciting times. The game has few great moments but near the end they degrade to simple story line. There isn't even a final battle except a button mashing one which made it about as exciting as pong in 2011.Overall I was happy with the game. The ending to it is horrible. Just horrible. It opens up for Bullet Storm 2, but I don't think I'm getting that title due to some of the issues with this game. Overall it's funny, but I don't think I want to make it a habit buying sequels to this game. It's fun but the story is non-existence and having one large, continuous b-rated storyline would not be very fun. Plus the gun play, which exciting at first, gets boring at the end when you figured out the patterns. Overall fun, but don't want a sequel.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Overall fun and funny", "unixReviewTime": 1299715200, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2011"}
{"reviewerID": "A3HORVSI2I23YR", "asin": "B003H0CC2O", "reviewerName": "Dasbooby", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I had fun with this game but it relies on one premise to make it fun and that's the skill-shots.  If you don't feel like doing them then this game is going to get overly repetitive and boring quickly.Story - You're the leader of a band of space pirates who were formerly a special ops group.  Your boss has had you killing innocent civilians while telling you they're bad/dangerous people.  You find out and now you want revenge.  Fast forward a little and you and the bad guy have crash landed on a planet full of criminals and some other things.  The rest of the game is you and your partner hunting down the bad guy to get your revenge.  Nothing really new or interesting here but it's a shooter so not a huge deal.Characters - There are 4 main characters.  You, your partner Ishi, a female spec ops soldier named Trishka and the main bad guy General Sarrano.  There are some minor characters but they die 2 seconds into the game.  There's nothing really great about any of them and you're very unlikely to get attached to any of them.  It's also unlikely that you'll end up hating any of them either.  They all serve their purposes so once again not a big deal.Dialogue - The game starts off on a bad note with every character swearing, and not just a little but a lot.  I don't mind swearing but it was like listening to a bunch of 8 year olds who just found out some \"bad words\".  It's fairly annoying at first and I thought I was going to dislike the game pretty quickly.  With that said, as the game goes on, it's clear that all this excess swearing is part of what they were going for to make the characters over the top for humorous effect.  Eventually, while I didn't enjoy the dialogue that much, I found that it grew on me somewhat and laughed at a joke here or there.Gameplay - Like I said, this is a skilless shooter.  You'll attack enemies until you get shot enough that your screen will turn red and you'll hide behind some object for about 4-5 seconds before your screen clears up and you're good to go again.  Repeat over and over.  You'll get a leash early on that allows you to grab an enemy and fling them towards you in the air, normally in slow motion.  You can use this infinitely and it'll work on nearly every enemy.  You also have the ability to kick enemies which suspends most of them in slow motion for about 3 seconds.The main premise of the game is to use your weapons, leash, and kick abilities to do special moves which get you points that you can spend to upgrade your weapons.  You'll get points for just killing enemies but not very much.  There are objects littered all over the board like explosive barrels, explosive hot dog carts, cactus, spiked bars, electric wires, etc.  By kicking enemies or leashing enemies into these objects you'll get extra points.  Each weapon will also have a list of special ways to use them to get unique kills that will get bonus points.  One of the nice things about the game is that the special moves list is sorted by each weapon and non-weapon.  It'll place a check mark next to any you've completed so that you know you've done it.  It'll also let you hit a button to hide any special moves you've done so that you'll only see the incomplete ones.  There are also a lot of quick time events that will pop up to give you more points.  Part of the problem is eventually you'll do most of the skill-shots once just to do them and get the bonus points they give and then you'll just be repeating the same boring easy ones over and over.The game is also extremely linear.  You aren't going to be exploring anything during the course of this game.  You'll be on a path the whole time and the game will even point out things you need to kick or leash in order to continue along this linear path.Weapons/Upgrades - Including the leash, I think there are 9 weapons.  There's a standard revolver, assault rifle, and shotgun but there are a couple unique weapons.  Some of these are useful and some are not really useful at all.  The sniper rifle is powerful but can get annoying.Every weapon has the same upgrades.  You'll spend an initial amount of points just to unlock the ability to upgrade it and access it's special moves list.  You can then spend points you've earned to buy ammo, get more total ammo, unlock it's special charge attack, buy charge attacks and buy more total charge attacks.  That's it.Enemies - There's really not a whole lot of variety.  You've got weak melee attackers, some suicide bombers and then everything else has guns and blasts at you.  None of them are challenging in the least.Challenge - If you're looking for a game that requires some semblance of skill than look elsewhere.  This game is just way too easy.  I wasn't sure what to expect coming in so I played it on hard and still found it to be a cakewalk.  You could beat this game never doing any of the special moves and just using the assault rifle the whole time.  Heck, outside of bosses/mini bosses/air units, you could probably just use the kick move the whole time and beat the game.  I'm not exagerating here.  There were parts where I simply just stood in one spot and kept hitting the kick button while melee enemies would run up to me and I would send them flying into some spikes, killing them without ever getting hit.  The mini-bosses aren't hard.  They're really just toughened enemies that will appear every once and a while with the other normal enemies.  They can be killed really quickly and with ease just using the assault rifle charge shot and the leash.  I think there are only 2 actual bosses in the game and both are incredibly easy.  The final boss is just fought in a quick-time event.  The only times you'll really die during this game is if you go out of your way to try and do a skill-shot.  Other than this, you'll almost never die.  It's also impossible to fall to your death as every ledge has an invisible wall to keep you up.Length - The game is maybe 8 hours if you spend time trying to do a lot of the trick shots.  If you ignore these or just don't care though, I could see people beating the game in 6-7 hours, maybe less.Minor problems - I don't know why but they don't have a jump button in the game.  You'll press the A button to vault over obstacles in your path.  The game also relies on a single auto save for your game.  I had the game glitch twice.  Once an enemy somehow pushed me on top of a car.  Because the game has invisible walls, I wasn't able to walk off.  Fortunately, I was smart enough to try using the slide button which got me off of it.  Another time some enemies or explosions pushed me into a pile of tables or something that I couldn't get out of no matter what I did.  I quickly reloaded the previous checkpoint before the game had time to auto save me in there and force me to restart the board.  The Echoes mode is simply parts of the campaign that you can play as a timed challenge to get points on a leaderboard.  Way to go the extra mile on that mode.  The entire campaign you have at least one AI partner with you yet there is no included co-op play.Overall - The game is alright and it has it's fun moments.  If you're doing the skill shots you'll have fun with the game.  If you don't bother with them then I hope you enjoy kicking enemy after enemy into a pit or some spikes since that's all you'll be doing.  The game is simply too easy and it's not satisfying killing these dumb enemies over and over again the same way.  This game is better than some skilless shooters but in the end this is simply another overrated skilless shooter.  I'd say the game is about a 6/10.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Another overhyped skilless shooter", "unixReviewTime": 1343692800, "reviewTime": "07 31, 2012"}

{"reviewerID": "A3OOIS6U00QJJX", "asin": "B003H0CC2O", "reviewerName": "Dev", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Looking at its trailers and hearing its reviews, I had little to no expectations for this game. But then I liked Gears of War and Shadow Complex games and since this was also being released by Epic, I thought why not give it a shot. After finishing the campaign mode and trying Ecos and Anarchy modes, I have to say I am quite surprised.***********PROS.***************-AWESOME COMBAT SYSTEM: This is the best aspect of this game. You can slide, leash to pull enemies, kick them and use variety of weapons with primary and second fire and pull a huge variety of combination off of them. At first you may feel like it may get redundant, but thanks to variety in levels, there are a huge variety of things you can do. Thanks to that you won't get bored till the end of the campaign.-VARIETY IN LEVELS: Other than awesome combat, there is plenty of variety in levels. Throughout the campaign you experience a variety of environments including the space, woody greenery filled areas, abandoned factories, building high in the sky that is about to fall apart and list goes on.-SURPRISES: There parts during the campaign where you will be surprised by certain events and the gameplay that will follow it. I really don't want to spoil it for you, but trust me you will like it.-GREAT GRAPHICS AND DECENT ART WORK: The first time I saw the trailer for this game, it really looked unpolished to me. But now that I have finished the campaign, I can say that since then they seem to have refined it quite a bit. Certain levels just look gorgeous. I guess never doubt the power of unreal engine.-VARIETY IN WEAPONS: There are 8 different types of weapons and that is not including the leash. Each weapons (including leash) has devastating alternate fire mode. There is just plethora of combos you can do if you mix and match these weapons. I personally enjoyed each and every one of them. Also, while some weapons may look and sound familiar from other games, they will play very differently in this game. For example with sniper rifle in this game you can change the direction of bullet after you fire it. I personally have enjoyed the variety very much.-UPGRADABLES: To top of each weapon is upgradeable with the skill point you earn by killing enemies in creative ways. This rpg element will truly encourage you to creatively kill enemies and get as many skill points as possible. While this rpg element is not as well thought of as other games, it still adds incentive to do your best.-ONLINE PLAY AND ECOS MODE: While not my favorites (see cons.), after you finish the game, you can stay busy by playing online multiplayer (anarchy mode) or Ecos mode which has the same levels as campaign but gives you stars on your performance.************CONS************-RELATIVELY SHORT CAMPAIGN: Hate how games these days have such short single player campaigns. Unfortunately bulletstorm is one of them. While I enjoyed each and every moment of the campaign I found it to be very short (~7-8 h max and that is because I explore a lot).-MINOR GLITCHES: I had my character stuck while jumping over objects at least 3-4 times. Unacceptable. All the games have glitches, but under no circumstances your character should be stuck like this. I mean you can't even kill yourself. Restarting the level is the only option.-MEH MULTIPLAYER AND ECOS MODE: Compare to some other games these days, I didn't enjoy the multiplayer so much. I got tired of it rather quickly. Also the Ecos mode felt the exact same as the campaign. I wish they had added more varieties.-LACK OF NEW GAME+ MODE: This is a game that can really use a new game+ mode (i.e. start with all the weapons you collected etc.). Unfortunately, it doesn't have it. So there are some really cool weapons and upgrades you get towards the end of the game. Unfortunately, if you want to use them again, you will have to play the game again and you will only get to use them for last few levels. Just very unfortunate.**********CONCLUSION****************Simply speaking I am looking forward to Bulletstorm 2. Partly because I enjoyed this game and partly I have faith in the developers that they will improve the weak aspects of this game. All and all I enjoyed pulling off crazy combos in beautiful, but destructible environments, but I wish they had longer campaign and had fixed some of the things described in the con section. I give this game 8.5/10.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quite Surprised", "unixReviewTime": 1299542400, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2011"}

You shoot progressively bigger monsters with progressively bigger guns until you find the bad guy and shoot him for while (sorry, spoiler alert, you fight a bad guy at the end)...  Okay, so Bulletstorm doesn't bring much new to the table, but I promise you, you're not gonna care.  It takes the tried and true formula for a first person shooter, moves it forward at a double time and lets you try your best to keep up.  It's an old school roller coaster of a game, linear and almost totally on rails, that is well worth the price of admission.It doesn't start off so hot, though...  actually, it's starts off BRILLIANTLY, with your character drunk off his ass and interrogating a bound and bloody bounty hunter who was hunting a price on your head.  But it doesn't take long to devolve from there, as we get into some of the worst dialogue and story-telling I've heard in years.  There's an awkward flashback, then a jump in time, some terrible voice acting and me left wondering just what the hell is going on.  Not that it matters - it's pretty clear from the get-go who the bad guy is and his untimely betrayal comes as zero suprise.  Then I'm on some... resort?  Like, an entire planet that's a resort?  Is that what it is?  With tough chick side-kick and cyborg side-kick.  And there's gangs of guys and then gangs of... zombies?  I don't know, a bunch of things that look like Gollum with a gun.  Nothing is set up, things are kind of explained after the fact but not really; it's a narrative mess is what I'm getting at.  Early on I was having some dangerous and upsetting flashbacks toCall Of Juarez: The Cartel, which is an ugly path I didn't want to walk down again.  Bulletstorm, of course, doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as and Call of Juarez game; it knows it's borderline retarded and doesn't hesitate to wallow in that.  It's a brave and bold game, even if it does eat its own glue-stick.But where Cartell failed miserably, Bulletstorm exceeds.  The gameplay is frantic and addictive, putting a couple of new spins on space marine FPS.  There are a couple of gimmicks in this one that work out pretty nice, first among them being the 'leash'.  It's a beam of blue... energy?  Mind powers?  Who cares, you grab bad guys with it and fling them around.  Once flung (by anything, actually, not just the leash) the baddies spin through the air in a sort of slow motion, letting you plan some sort of grizzly demise for them.  You've also got a dedicated 'kick-in-the-face' button, which you'll use as much as any gun.  You see, bulletstorm is littered with environmental hazards (spikes, frayed wires, lava pits, cliffs) and you're rewarded with points for finding clever ways to kill. In fact, there's an in game list of well over a hundred different ways to explode (or what-have-you) a monster using your weapons, the environment, or some wacky combination of the two.  Harder combos yield more points and, since you need those points to buy bullets and upgrade your weapons, you spend most of your time not thinking about surviving but about how to most creatively dispatch.  It's a strong point for the game as well as a weakness: bullets are hard to come by, so you better get creative if you want to get heated at the next drop-box.  Constantly having to link up to dropboxes to resupply and monitoring your point intake gives the game a needlessly choppy feel and pulls you out of the action time and time again as you're constantly trading out weapons to ones you have bullets for or just ones that might fit the fight better.  In the end, though, that's a small hiccup and the swift and often brutal ways of maiming your opponents (maybe I'll light him on fire, shoot his leg off and kick him into the electrical wire?  It's been that kind of day, why not?) remain the highlight of the game.  And the more efficient you can become with it, the more satistying it is - leading to a healthy amount of replay value.Which is welcome, because the game is rather short (8 hours?  something like that?).  That, and the ending is incredibly unsatisfying, with the ending fight completely failing in comparison to some of the games more awesome and cinematic moments throughout.  Listen, I know you want to set up a sequel, but COME ON, give me SOME kind of final fight!  With a game this insane and a story as weak as this one, it would not be hard to BS your way into the plot for a second chapter once you've wrapped up this one.  Seriously, give me a satisfying final fight; I'm not in this for the plot at this point (looking square at you Halo 2).Even with its failings, I have to recommend Bulletstorm.  It's a lovely take on a FPS and a juicy dose of the old ultra-violence.  There are even some pretty gorgeous landscapes and truly cinematic moments scattered here and there that would be worth checking out all on their own.  All in all, it's an excellent title to keep on the shelf for a rainy day... or just any day you feel the need to light someone fire, fling them through the air and then impale them screaming onto a giant cactus.

So I figured, why not get the game and also get the GoW 3 Beta as well?  Surprise surprise, turns out this game is one hell of a fun ride!As someone else mentioned, this game is essentially Gears of War meets FPS.  The graphics are phenomenal and the Unreal Engine still kicks butt.  It literally feels like a faster, looser, and even more violent version of Gears from a 1st person vantage point.  I gotta say, I really got into this game the second I started playing it.The story is pretty disposable - which is totally fine because I didn't really care about the plot because all I was thinking about was how to do as many different skill-based kills as I could with the awesomely fun arsenal of weapons that I had.  Even something as simple as using the whip was hilariously fun.  It's awesome when you can just do all sorts of different combo kills - even the simple ones such as whipping a person into the air, shooting them, then whipping them back again so you can kick the body back away and shoot a few more rounds for posterity comes off as insane and fun.  I also like how there is a very detailed list of kill types that you need to hit if you want to add bonus skill points.I started out playing only a little bit, but suddenly I found that several hours had passed by.  That's how this game works.  It just sucks you in because of the easy to pick up controls, solid gameplay, and addictive kill kill kill action that really never gets old.  Definitely worth picking up!ADD: I forgot to note the multiplayer aspect.  I had a decent time with it, as it reminds me of the horde gametype in GoW.  Had a blast playing with 3 other players to wipe out tons of NPCs, though in this case, it's the STYLE kills that really matter.  In the later rounds, it gets hard to level up unless you and your teammates meet the skill challenge kill.  Teamwork for killing is important, which is a nice twist from the usual point shoot kill move on aspects of some FPS games.

The gameplay seemed fluid and innovative. It seemed like gears of war combined with something that I've never seen before.However, from the very beginning of the game, it becomes evident that whoever wrote the dialogue was trying to make it as offensive and hard to listen to as possible. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind swearing at all. I'll gladly listen to a game that throws around R-rated language. That's not what bothers me. The thing that does bother me, however, is that there's a line between language being relevant and language just being annoying and childish. This game gets a running start and long-jumps over that line. The language of this game is reminiscent of the beginning of middle school when kids were just learning all the naughty words and had no idea how to use them. The characters throw around swear words that not only are not needed in a situation, but often don't even make any sense in the context in which they are used.And not only is the language bad, but the dialogue is just pathetic in some places. Most characters seem to have believable lines, however there are some (particularly the robot version of one of your allies who follows you throughout the game) who just spout poorly-written line after poorly-written line.Aside from that, though, the game is actually a fun and creative shooter. The gameplay is really smooth and fun. The game is a little over-the-top gory, but not much more than other games of the genre. I especially enjoyed sliding, for some reason.I really feel like this game could've earned a four or five star rating if not for the abysmal dialogue.Bottomline: fun game, terrible dialogue.

Are you an \"experienced\" gamer that has been playing FPSs for years?  Are you bored to tears with military style shooters that are so similar to one another that they all kind of just blend together?  Did this last iteration of killzone feel more like a chore than a good time?If you answered yes to any or all of these questions then bulletstorm might be the fresh take on the FPS genre that you need.PLOT:  I've read a few reviews bashing the plot of this game, and I honestly don't understand why.  Okay, nobody is mistaking Bulletstorm for Mass Effect.  But you know what?  It's not trying to be Mass Effect.  Bulletstorm does not take itself seriously, and neither should you.  The language and jokes are supposed to be over-the-top ridiculous, and if you can get into the spirit of what it's trying to do, you'll get some good laughs out of it.  And let's be real, if you think other FPSs like CoDMW/BO or BFBC2 have well constructed narratives, then you are sadly mistaken.Graphics:  I personally loved the graphics on this game.  It's probably not as technically impressive as KZ3, but the environments, colors and art direction put it above KZ in my book.  Some of the outdoor vistas are jaw dropping, and the set pieces in this game are absolute top notch.  The only time it got a bit \"blah\" was in a few of the underground levels later on.  These are few and far between though, and overall this is an extremely pretty game.Gameplay:  This is where Bulletsorm shines.  The leash mechanics work beautifully once you get the hang of it.  The shooting is tight and accurate.  Your character feels fast and agile, with a slide/kick function that provides you with several options for how to dispatch enemies.  But the best thing about Bulletstorm is that the \"kill with skill\" mantra is actually fun (really fun) to work at.  When I bought the game I thought that some of the kills I saw on the trailer would simply be too difficult to pull off, but the game is great about picking up what you are trying to do, and providing some assistance to help you get it done.  You'll want to play this game again just to go back through and find all of the neat ways to massacre your enemies.  I almost never repeat a game, and I'm already on my second playthrough of Bulletstorm.NOTE: for the people saying that these mechanics don't add anything to the game, they simply aren't trying to get anything out of the skillshot system.  If you go through BS like it's MW, then it will feel pretty familiar, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice.  There is so much to explore gameplay-wise, that it is an absolute fail not to experiment with the unique selection of guns and skills.Online:  I've only dabbled online, but this seems to be the only failing in the game.  I would have really like to seen some competitive online MP, but the closest we get to that in BS is the Echoes online play, which is essentially just an online leaderboard that keeps track of your scores for certain levels.  There is also some coop type games that are someone amusing.  Overall, these are all pretty lackluster.Verdict:  If you want to experience something new in the FPS genre, get this game.  Outstanding gameplay and gorgeous graphics highlight a fun, but simple romp on an alien world.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredibly Fun Game", "unixReviewTime": 1298851200, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2011"}

Once I picked up the controller I could not put it back down. The result was a game I finished quickly but find unquestionable replayable whenever I'm in the mood for insane FPS action!While the story is fairly generic, the voice acting and \"crude\" or \"vulgar\" dialogue (hilarious stuff, by the way) make the cut scenes a joy to witness. Characterizations are good, too, so you will care what happens to these people, you just might not be surprised.Gameplay is king here. Nothing feels more rewarding that rushing into the next battle zone, pulling an enemy towards you in slow-mo, then using your gun or mighty boot to send the poor fellow into a bed of spikes, pitfall, or giant cactus. Combat is generally fast and fluid. You'll also be rewarded for embracing the \"kill with skill\" mentality. Get creative and you'll receive points that allow you to purchase weapon upgrades and ammo. You won't get bored!Graphics are mostly good. Close-ups of characters tend to reveal some weakness (especially with hair detail and animation) but everything else looks great, especially the stunning backgrounds. During a brief moment of peace between firefights you'll eventually find yourself on a gorgeous seashore surrounded by mountains, waterfalls, and giant gears, all framed by a beautifully rendered sky and sunlight. The inclusion of such beauty amid the horrors of constant fighting is wonderfully effective.The game gets a strong five stars for presentation, insane levels of fun, and creative use of vulgar language. However there is one MAJOR issue that comes up at the VERY end of the game.SEMI-SPOILER ALERT!!!The ending sequence sets up a sequel that will likely never see the light of day due to lack of sales. I understand that the folks who made the game are a smaller group with the enormously successful Epic Games, makers of the Gears of War franchise, but they should have known better than to put a cliffhanger at the end of a brand new intellectual property. As someone who absolutely adored Bulletstorm from the opening seconds, it pains me to know that there is no true closure to the events.That said, I suggest starting a petition for a the developer (People Can Fly) to create a DLC package containing the final mission, so that everyone who loved the adventure of Grayson Hunt can finally get the closure they deserve.SEMI-SPOILER ALERT OVER!Conclusion: if you like over-the-top action shooters, and maybe hilariously off-color dialogue, this is a game you absolutely MUST play!

I was hoping it would be a different refreshing take on the genre, but it wasn't.  Yes, it's brilliantly colorful and fast-paced and has different weapons and cool different ways of killing an enemy, but I found it boring.  Slaughtering your way through a level in this game does not feel rewarding in the least, and I could care less about my point total, or comparing it online with some kid in Japan who will always hold the highest score for that level anyhow.  People don't care about their score anymore.  So by including something we USED to care about in a game that's meant for kids of TODAY, you get this mixed bag that doesn't work.  The graphics are great, and there's a lot going on - but there's almost TOO MUCH going on: Yes I can kill a guy a few different ways but there's SO MUCH action going on or other guys attacking you that it's not like you can spend time appreciating the devestation you create.

When you hear them speak, this is made pretty evident; you're not dealing with Einstein here, more like Frankenstein.The environments are beautifully rendered, lots of detail and variety. The character models are a little stiff but not bad, let's just say you won't be mistaking them for real people.Believe it or not, with all that is happening on the screen during a typical gun fight, the aiming system is pretty accurate. Most of the time, you are able to pull off the desired skill shots with little to no hassle at all. The game's controls are tight, not too difficult to learn nor too complicated during the long run, ultimately pretty fluid and user friendly.The online aspect of this game is different than most, you won't find your typical team deathmatch here. I will tell you though; the multiplayer portion is a lot more fun with friends than it is with random people. You will be entertained, but I don't know if you'll spend Call of Duty hours playing online here in the Bulletstorm world.If I could compare this game to anything else currently on the market, it would be a mash up of MadWorld, Gears of War and Borderlands, and if you ask me borrowing elements from those titles isn't a bad thing at all. If you're looking for a good time, nothing too serious, pick this game up, you won't be disappointed.By the way, in case you were wondering, the title is an inside joke for Xbox 360 players.Michael", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The only time when seeing the \"red ring of death\" isn't a bad thing!", "unixReviewTime": 1298505600, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2011"}

I had so much fun playing this game!Gameplay- The gameplay was what I thought would bring this game down. The gameplay is surprisingly smooth though. Sprint with the \"A\" button (such as in Gears of War) and you have option to melee with the right stick. Made it easy to adjust to. The objective is to either leash, kick or shoot your enemy in different skillful ways. Example- leash your enemy near you and kick them into a cactus with very large spikes. You get skill points for this which you can use for ammo and upgrades. Also as another reviewer stated, You can get stuck in random place not being able to move. It's happened to me at least 3-4 times but I've just pressed A twice to slide out of that spot.Graphics- Graphics are nice. Not Killzone or Gears of War nice but they are good. The characters are huge kind of like Gears of War characters but it fits the over the top nature of the game. The environments are where this game shines. They are beautiful and creative. Waterfalls and mountains make for nice visuals along the way.Game Modes- Of course the story isn't the games strong point. The story isn't bad either. So that I won't ruin it with spoilers I won't go on but the campaign is very short but with the wacky gameply it probably didn't need to be any longer. The Echoes and Multiplayer are the games strong points. Echoes you play solo while attempting to ge the best and highest skill points and skill shots to earn more stars. Multiplayer you can play the Anarchy mode, which allows you to play with up to 3 friends and fight through hordes of enemies. Each round gets harder but it's not just about killing the enemy. You much kill them in skillfull ways and earn enough points to move on to the next level. That makes the game different and fun. From what I've played of the multiplayer so far. It seems that they are having alot of lag problems. Hopefully they can get this fixed soon in a patch or update. I have held complete matches just fine though.Conclusion- This is a very good game. It's not a grade A shooter such as Call of Duty, Gears of War or Halo but it is a great alternative to the beyond serious military shooters.

It's got an amusing story with some incredibly dirty, but funny dialogue. It has some of the best graphics you'll see on any console, but most importantly it's addictive as hell. Ignore all the whiners complaining that its linear and repetitive. Hello, it's a shooter. Would you rather play a shooter where all you do is shoot people with a gun over and over? Yeah, that's not repetitive I guess...DERP. In Bulletstorm you literally have dozens of different ways to kill bad guys at all times and its up to you to figure out the best way. My favorite is shooting a big guy in the stomach, forcing him to double over in pain, run around him and kick off his back plate, and then shoot a flare up his butt. This will earn you a Skill Shot called Fire in the Hole, and as the big guy dies he lets out a really disgusting fart. Great stuff.The game is about 8 hours long if you don't rush through it, but when the campaign is over you then have Echoes mode, which is a ton of fun and adds hours upon hours of more gameplay.

{"reviewerID": "A2YSUZ7R9AGJIU", "asin": "B003H0CC2O", "reviewerName": "R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"", "helpful": [3, 6], "reviewText": "Bulletstorm is a rare game for me, in that not only does it earn five stars from me, but it's a first person shooter at that. In the same way that a movie like Shoot 'Em Up is nowhere near the same level as say, Citizen Kane, they are both near flawless movies, but for entirely different reasons. The same is true of Bulletstorm. It is nearly flawless, but a unique type of game, one that you really won't play for the story, because you really won't get a whole lot out of it. But that's okay, because the developers knew this and didn't try to awkwardly insert any kind of real seriousness into the game. Bulletstorm is over the top in pretty much every single way. It's extremely vulgar, violent and bloody, and it's fantastic.The game takes place on a resort planet, overrun by mutated humans as well as the locals (and even the fauna) after your ship crash lands there post space battle with a warship commanded by the antagonist of the story and the man who betrayed you and your squad and has a bounty on all of your heads. That's all I will say as far as the story is concerned, I will not spoil anything for anyone who hasn't played the game. I will say, however, that the writer(s) of the game did a great job in that even at the end of the game, many issues are left unresolved. There is no Hollywood ending where everything is tied in a neat bow. Your character does have an arc emotionally, but it's much more reserved than most other games (or movies, for that matter) and adds additional layers of depth.When I say resort world, I mean it. Most of the visuals in this game are extraordinary. Colors are vivid, the clouds, sun and sky are breathtaking to look at, and a lot of the game takes place in various tall buildings. The scope of some of the falls are really something to behold. I tell you this only because the care with which each section of the game was detailed is very apparent, and it also really pays off, lending itself greatly to the atmosphere of the game. Immersion can be a beautiful and violent thing.The voice acting is...okay. I'm wasn't really ever playing this game for the story, which is a fairly typical and straightforward revenge deal, so the voice work was pretty much all it needed to be. And besides that, more than half the dialog is sexual innuendo with much swearing thrown in for good measure, so does it really matter how the lines are delivered? Not that much. I think the only complaint I can really make here is that in this game, as in almost all others where the situation arises, the actors use normal speaking volume in a situation that the in-game characters would realistically want to be much quieter in. But hey, nothing's perfect, and the game is so much fun that this complaint is pretty much a non-issue.After crash landing you and one of your squad members have to leave to find some power cells, and in this quest the game really takes a hold of you. You see an elite soldier of the Confederation (the government and former military which you once served), called a Final Echo, battling a group of mutated humans. He is ultimately crushed by a car though, and from his body you take the Leash which will serve you for the remainder of the game. The Leash is made from some sort of matter that can both interact with the environment and pass through parts of it. For instance sometimes to get across a broken bridge you will have to drop something down that you can use to cross over it, so you'll have to wrap it around say, a bus. But you can also throw your Leash through objects to grapple enemies and pull them towards you (the Leash is used by pressing the Left Bumper, and more advanced uses require you to hold the button down). Soon after gaining the Leash, its nano-processors flood your body and you receive your HUD, which fades (another way in which the game is immersive), leaving only your first-person view and no ugly ammo counters or health displays to impede the beauty of the scenery.The Leash serves two functions: Firstly, it is your connection to Confederate DropKits scattered plentifully throughout the game. DropKits allow you to upgrade your weapons and purchase more ammo for them using the points you gain with Skillshots, or, killing enemies in unique and skillful ways. The Leash's second function is that, as previously stated, you can grapple enemies and pull them towards you. Combined with the seven (I think? Maybe eight) weapons and their charged abilities, plus your kick and slide ability (B and double-tapping A, respectively), plus the environment, you must defeat your enemies in new and interesting ways. Some of them are entirely clever, and some will only seem obvious after you accidentally do them the first time. More difficult Skillshots are rewarded with more points you can put towards upgrades and ammo.As far as the weapons in the game go, they are pretty neat and easy to understand. I do think though, that the developers felt like they had to add more weapons than they really needed to. I stuck with four throughout the entire game. Some of them I just found impractical to carry with me, as they only really had very situational uses, and since ammunition in the game isn't plentiful (which I liked), I stuck with weapons that were most effective most of the time). All weapons have a secondary ability, and you can carry three weapons total, or, your default assault rifle plus two others. And here is where my greatest annoyance with the game lies. And once I tell you what it is, you can relax, because it's really not a big deal. There are two different ways to change your weapons. First, quick change, which is whatever secondary weapon you're using plus your assault rifle. So if you have the shotgun equipped and you tap Y, you go right back to the assault rifle. Tap Y again and it will go back to the shotgun. The second way to change your weapon is to hold Y, which brings up a weapon interface on-screen. However, when you're out of ammo, or you have emptied a magazine and want to just switch to a different weapon instead of reloading, holding Y (which does NOT pause gameplay) really leaves you wide open for attack. Since you are only able to carry three weapons at a time anyways, I don't know why the developers don't allow you to simply cycle through all three weapons. Then there'd be no need for a weapon interface at all. Just my opinion though.Wracking my brain, the only other possible complaint I have is about this game's self-awareness. And by that I mean that there are a few instances in the first half of the game where you might come across a horribly dismembered and bloody corpse, or someone impaled on a spike, and your character makes some sort of comment about how awful it all is. But you know, this is right after I just achieved the \"Pricked\" Skillshot for kicking an enemy into a cactus. What I'm doing is really no less violent and deranged than what the murderous locals are doing. Just one more thing that took me out of the moment.However, on to more good. I didn't time it exactly, but the game seemed to be about 8-10 hours, and my first playthrough (which I just finished) was on the Hard difficulty. Difficulties range from Very Easy to Easy, then Normal, then Hard, then Very Hard. I am no hardcore FPS player, and I didn't have but maybe one part give me difficulty. For the most part even playing on Hard wasn't that difficult. 8-10 hours isn't that long, especially when you compare it to something like Fallout: New Vegas, where hundreds of hours can be put into a single playthrough, however, this also means that you aren't required to do pointless filler missions that don't really make sense to the ultimate conclusion of the story. In every objective you know exactly why you're doing what you're doing, and that is needed if you want me to care at all about what's going on in the game. To add to that, even though the story is fairly short, because of the Skillshots it also has a very high replayability factor, which not a lot of games have anymore.Overall, Bulletstorm accomplished a lot, even if it isn't exactly anything mind-blowing. It achieved exactly what it intended to, the game did not crash or lag at all (at ALL), there are some truly epic boss battles, some really hilarious banter between characters, and in the end, there's even a point to the excessive violence in the game. This is one of those few games that I will not say \"Wait until the price drops if you buy it.\" You could, of course, but the game is just such a fun experience that I want everyone to be able to...well, experience it.***Update 2/23/2011*** It was brought to my attention that it is possible to hotkey the weapons you are carrying so as to avoid what I described as my biggest complaint about the game.

Clearly taking inspiration from classic arcade shooters Bulletstorm features a light, breezy plot heavy on gunplay, power ups, and colorful locations.  If you're looking for a game that emphasizes fun and a colorful art style over narrative and innovation than you've found your game.In Bulletstorm the player is let loose into a world where each kill earns them points (the more creative the kill the more points earned).  Did I mention that the world happens to be an abandoned amusement park located on an alien planet?  Sadly there's nothing truly spectacular about the game's gunplay.  Boss fights in particular are a frustrating disappointment.  The lasso (a beam of light you can grab and throw opponents with) is an outstanding idea which I had a lot of fun playing with, but there isn't enough to truly set Bulletstorm apart from other shooters.The bosses in Bulletstorm actually have giant glowing \"shoot here!\" spots, a trope I thought had disappeared from gaming years ago.  On top of that not a single one of them offers much of a challenge.  An arcade style shooter like this should have made its boss battles the highlight of the game, but all they amount to is a slight roadblock between levels.The story has some nice touches here and there, but ultimately isn't anything you'll be raving about.  Each character in Bulletstorm is a caricature acting more like a cartoons than actual human beings.  There is the grizzled, alcoholic leader, a tough as nails woman with an attitude,  and an all-business cyborg.  Those are the three characters most interacted with in Bulletstorm, and while they certainly sport some fun dialogue one never feels overly attached to them.  They, like the plot, lack true focus.  This prevents you, the gamer, from entering their world and as a result the world just isn't as magical as it should have been.Bulletstorm, like its setting, is an amusement park.  It's fun but ultimately lacks substance.  There's nothing innovative about the game play and the story won't engage a gamer on any emotional level.  Does that make it a bad game?  Not really.

That is pretty much everything to the game.Let me start by talking about the campaign. I had a blast with the campaign. The dialog was over-the-top vulgar which played into the humor of the game. Some people may not like it, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I even replayed parts of the campaign just for some of the one liner dialogs that made me laugh. The action is mostly non stop with breaks and pauses that tie into the story. The story coupled with the entertaining game mechanics makes it top notch... except it's far to short and there is no coop for the campaign (which is highly dumb in my opinion as I got the game primarily thinking it was a coop campaign like gears of war).So then one is left to playing echos mode or anarchy. I enjoyed what little of anarchy I could get to work. There were constant desyncs that made it not so fun, but once that's worked out, it has potential. There needs to be a high level of coordination between the team members to make any real progress. The teams I played with were highly unorganized which was a huge limiting factor to progression. I didn't find a way to play against other players, only cooperatively which is mostly fine for me being a coop preference player. I only ever got the same map over and over, but I think there are a half dozen maps with more to come. Once the bugs are worked out in MP, it will be much better.That leaves echos. Echos is basically going through the campaign missions and racking up as many points as you can muster. Then your score is posted on the leader boards for all to see. In reality it is pretty underwhelming because unless you are the best of the best, no one will ever know or care.All that said, the gameplay and control is the important part of the whole game. You are basically supposed to shoot and kill enemies in unique and creative ways. That is only a half truth. There are only a hand full (probably 100 or so) different ways the game looks for, for deaths. In reality, it doesn't really reward creativity like the game is advertised. I've done some pretty spectacular things with killing an enemy or a group only to get a 10 point minimum added to my score. Even performing 3 or 4 of the prescripted things, often times only yields points for one of them. Now, I could very well be doing something wrong and not grasping the whole skill shot concept, but the most points I could ever really get were in the order of 500 at a time or so (mostly on bosses). For me it came down to doing the same half dozen effective and point effective skill shots because there were no points for doing things in a flourish manner.The controls themselves were decent, though, my gripe would be having to push the stick button to execute a kick. I'd much have preferred a few more control schemes to get one that worked better for me, but it's a minor gripe.The graphics are pretty, just like every other game to have come out in the last couple years. They are very bright and vibrant and add to the comedic yet serious atmosphere of the game.Overall, the game is quite fun and the skills system has potential, but I wish it would reward creativity instead of who can get lucky enough to execute a prescripted method until all methods are completed. The humor of the campaign is a love it or hate it type of humor that depends heavily on vulgarity. Once the multiplayer is stabilized and expanded, the life of the game will go beyond that of 10 hours (6 hours for campaign if you take your time and 4 hours before you get tired of desyncing from other players, maybe an hour or two of echos if you like that style of gameplay). For now, I'd say it's worth getting once the price comes down a bit. It's definitely a $40 game, but not a $60 game.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fun game, but needs more", "unixReviewTime": 1298592000, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2011"}

Whats more, along with the headphones themselves needing a power source and small adapter, the 5.1 sound box also needs power (of course).

I picked up these headphones mostly for playing in the early morning or late night hours so I didn't wake up my kiddies. If I was going to buy a headset at all, I wasn't going to buy something that was mediocre and regret not getting the \"good\" headphones later on. As soon as I put these headphones on, I was amazed at the sound.I am a big CoD player so a quality set of headphones really goes a long way for helping your gameplay. I was surprised about how much I could now hear in games that I never heard before. Now I am hearing sounds that I never knew existed. Even though they are not the lightest headphones out there, they are extremely comfortable and the weight doesn't bother me at all. In fact, my ears fit inside such that there is nothing pressing on my ears at all which used to bother me after long playing sessions with other traditional headsets. The mic is as clear as a bell. I've had people comment on how clear I sound online and ask what headset am I using.The headphones are also wired, and that is an understatement. There are wires everywhere but really only one long one from the adapter to your headset so there is not a ton of wires that people have to step over. Most of the remaining wiring is close to the PS3 or whatever system you use this on. The fact that it's wired is good and bad. Good in the sense that you'll never have to put batteries in it and bad in the sense that, well, it isn't wireless. But since I am playing like this when everyone else is asleep, it doesn't come into play.The green lights on the outside are pretty cool but when you are not playing can be annoying so I usually unplug them when not in use.

As things stand now, if you want to play a hockey game, you've got no where else to turn, so in a way any review is a waste.  However, if you are on the fence, this review will help determine which side you want to jump on.--------------Update:  3/31/11I've been playing season mode a lot, since I don't have internet currently, and I want to say this: the computer cheats.I'm playing superstar, and there is a huge double standard that has caused my controller to get tossed more than 10 times.  For example, if I knock the computer off the puck, it's irrelevant, as he'll get back to the puck 80% of the time (unless I knock him down, and then he's prone to flailing on the ice and sometimes knocking the puck away).  The other way around, if he hits me, I can rarely get back to the puck; he nearly always beats me to it or he's got support to take the puck.  You can't have it both ways.  Also, the computer is awesome at skating through my body when I dive.  It's really amazing, as if I'm not even there.  And the computer also likes to poke check through my body too, so even when I think I have positioning, it's irrelevant, because he's got magic powers.Finally, the goalies are not made equal.  My goalie seems to let in really, really pathetic goals, whereas the computer makes ridiculous saves.I want this game to be difficult on it's highest setting, but this isn't difficult, it's cheating.  If I have 2 steps on someone to a loose puck, and I'm using speed burst, they should not be able to out race me 9 times out of 10 (as the 'hawks, Kane and Campbell seem to be able to skate as fast as Wade Brookbank.  Sure, sure).  I know you can edit the settings to make the superstars stand out, but why is that even a feature? Why bother rating the players if Daniel Winnick is going to score a hat trick on me?Anyway, thanks for playing unfair computer.--------------BE A PRO MODE:The problems with Be A Pro mode that have been in previous NHL's is still there.  Your AI teammates are useless.  Their passes are garbage (sometimes they will ignore your passing request), they will lose nearly every board battle, are super good at turning the puck over, and the D will completely abandon the crease.Essentially, Be A Pro mode will involve you playing 1 on 5.  And why would you want to bother with that?  Let's move on to the part of the NHL series which just keeps getting worse.UNLOCKABLES:For the EASHL (this is where you play as your own character) you either have to pay to improve your character or play a ton of games to do so.  A lot of the unlockables involve playing 40+ games of Be a Pro, the major problem being that it's a nearly unbearable experience.So, you will have to pay one way or another, either with money or with a lot of your time (and sanity).  This is a problem, not just from a greed stand point, but in that players will always be artificially good.  Everyone should be the same, and whoever is the better player should be the standard, not whoever spent more MS points than you.HUT (New Addition, Needs Deletion):I find Hockey Ultimate Team to be a gigantic waste.  I have played 2 games online, only to unlock something for my EASHL player.  Why would I want to play another game where the player I'm up against can just buy better players?  Why would I want to play a game where my players are rated so low they can't make a pass, poke check, or skate?NEW GAME = NEW ERRORSThe checking in this game with the \"new\" physics engine is cartoonish.  I've been checked from behind on the rush and have gone flying.  I've hit someone with a tip of my elbow and they are tossed ragdoll-style in the opposite direction.Outside of that, goalies currently have a proclivity for pushing the puck in their own net.  They will make a butterfly save and then proceed to bat the puck in the net.  What a joke.And again, the AI can stick lift you even when you are in front of them.  If you even try to do that, you will get 2 minutes.One funny addition to the EASHL is 10 minute majors.  If your friend gets one, it's a riot b/c he's out of the game.  However, for online team play, this means a computer team mate for the rest of the game (everyone usually quits, anyway), which can be a nuisance.  So, Im unsure if I like this new penalty.Summation:Again, what choice do you have if you want to play a hockey game?  As time goes on, I'll add to the review.  It can be a very fun to play, but the mistakes in the game will also cause a lot of frustration as they are so incredibly stupid.  Is is worth the agitation to you?UPDATE -Since the last tuner update, the goalies have become horrible.  I've seen them get beat on simple, unscreened wrist shots, and on a 2 on 1 the goalie completely ignored the shooter, leaving the entire left side open (assuming a pass).  Just great, EA.Also, the Online Team Play rooms are still buggy (although it appears they finally learned to count -- it was Online Team Play Room #1, Online Team Play Room #1, and Online Team Play Room #1 as available rooms instead of 1,2,3).  In NHL 10, the Xbox 360 would just freeze at random spots.  So far, there's two spots where it will freeze, one of which is loading the game room in online team play.  I was gently hoping that since EA now requires you to have a passcode to play online, that that would mean less problems.Um, nope.Finally, passing, while I'm sure I still need more time to get use to it, it definitely still needs refinement.  It should not be THAT hard to send a pass and to receive one.

NHL 09 was awesome, NHL 10 was even better, and now here comes NHL 11 with a whole bunch of new features and improvements - think evolution, not revolution.  If you're new to the NHL franchise, then rest assured that you're buying into a fantastic and fun hockey simulation.  The graphics are great, there are tons of teams to choose from, a huge amount of customization, and solid online functionality.  Want to take on the Canadians with the Bruins in Boston while wearing throwback jerseys?  With three of your friends offline or up to eleven online?  No problem!  Laying a big hit into someone is more satisfying than ever before, and the new physics system allows for some really dynamic situations.Since the NHL formula is so well established at this point, I thought it would be productive to list a version of some major changes you'll notice between NHL 10 and the new NHL 11.  Hopefully this list will help you decide if the new features/improvements are worth it for you:- Passes now happen when you RELEASE the pass trigger, not when you press it.  The strength of your pass is controlled by how long you hold the button before the release.  This is the first major gameplay change I noticed in NHL 11.  The more I play with this, the more I like the change - although as a result I'm having a little more trouble getting one-timers off.- In NHL10 faceoffs almost always resulted in the puck going directly to a player on the ice, in NHL 11 faceoffs are much more dynamic.  It's possible to switch grips, shove, or block your faceoff opponent.  Many more options this time around, faceoffs are definitely more interesting.  In NHL9/10 faceoffs were pretty formulaic and boring.- Broken sticks can happen and take a player mostly out of play.  He'll still be able to kick the puck and block/check, but is obviously at a big disadvantage.  Teammates can hand off their stick as a replacement, or the player can go to the bench to get a new one.  You can also lose your stick if you get cleaned out during a huge hit.- If you are a fan of Madden Ultimate Team mode, then you'll be happy to know that EA has implemented something similar in this game: Hockey Ultimate Team.  This mode is based on collecting trading cards of players, stadiums, coaches, etc. and using these options to build your team.  As you win games, you'll unlock more cards and improve your team.- You can now play online with friends against a purely CPU controller team.  This was a major missing feature from NHL10, and it's great to see that they fixed it.- A `hustle' button (push in left stick) will temporarily give your player a burst of speed.  This feature existed in some previous NHL games, but not in NHL 10.- There's a whole new physics-based engine powering the game.  This can affect lots of different things in the game, from checks to puckhandling to- When laying out a check, you can choose between hitting high and hitting low.  Combined with the new physics engine, this creates some really fun hits.- Reworked trade logic in the `Be a GM' mode.

EA's NHL series is an excellent one, it gives the action of hockey in a game and makes it fun and precise and the series won many awards and is generally considered the best video game hockey franchise (rivaled only by 2K). For years EA provided gamers with great yearly edition of hockey and only made the game better and better. NHL 11 is exactly like that except there is not as much new content as you'd imagine there might be. GM mode did not change much, they only added one or two new option and Be A Pro mode is not all that different either. The on-ice upgrades they did (like new faceoffs, better checking and broken sticks)definitely add something to the already solid gameplay.NHL 11 offers a few changes and some interesting modes but I don't feel like it's enough, for this reason some fans of the franchise might be disappointed with it as there is not enough of a change in 11. It's not that different from the past year's edition, NHL 10, and even 09 is pretty close to it. EA stuck and played it safe with a winning formula but added a few things to improve the game overall. I must say I do like the additions EA made to the game this year, they make it more realistic (for example the broken sticks) and add to the experience. The same modes are present with little more content; the game is basically the same as the past version on that point, only online has anything different. Ultimate team is a nice online mode but can be complicated to figure out (similar to the Madden franchise's Ultimate Team except with hockey where you can try and build the \"dream team\"). It seems as if it's even the same graphics only the animations are considerably better. The real new content of the game lies in the gameplay, for instance the controls are improved significantly for the faceoffs (it's great), passes, you can now check high or low and you can jump over an opponent who's down on the ice. Defensive techniques are better and the deeke system feels much better. Those little upgrades are very noticeable and contribute in bringing the gamer a great hockey video gaming experience you can't fault EA Sports for that but you can criticize them for lacking new features.However those who own NHL 2010 may not think of this a more than just another yearly update in the series, there's probably not enough new content to keep you happy this time around so you might want to reconsider purchasing this right away and play it before you spend over 60$ for it, just my thought. When I first popped the game in and did the requirement player exercises and it looked like it was the same as the past versions (or even 09), that's how bad it was. If this is your first time buy for a hockey video game or if you have not bought any EA hockey title since a few years I would really recommend this to you. The improved controls help the game but NHL 11 lacks new features. Those who buy the new edition each year will probably want it regardless for the upgrades and the updated roster. If that's your case buy it now, if not wait until you try it otherwise you may regret your purchase. Don't get me wrong I'm a little upset about the lack of new content, a new mode would've been nice (not an online one, online is totally different) but I'll take it, EA's NHL 11 is the best NHL game out there. 4 stars", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Still the best hockey video game but not that different from previous edition", "unixReviewTime": 1283904000, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2010"}

Though in sports games more players can make the game trickier, if players play together long enough, it can create a huge advantage.There are different ways to take a face off, and it's extremely nice to be able to tie up a player who just seems to have the edge instead of loosing.From what I've seen, fights are mostly won by taping the punch button (right analog \"up\") as fast as possible while holding one's head to a direction (left analog). Though there's not much diversity in the fights, it's a nice way to relieve anger, and change the momentum of a game. (NOTE* i play with 2 friends and i'm positive were not in the top half of the online players, so maybe the better players have more of a strategy).Momentum is great, players getting tired based on how many hits they've taken, how long they've skated, and how well they're line and team is doing.The game is quite real, with responsive controls, official NHL stats, and beautiful visuals. Certain players are faster, and stronger, while certain teams have trouble winning. This is somewhat a down-er as a leafs fan, as i'm constantly facing the Canucks, the Penguins, and the Capitals online (the three highest rated teams, against the near lowest), but it is true to life. The only thing that is exaggerated are hits;, when players are hit they fall more often then they would in real life. This just allows for more visual satisfaction to a well timed hit, and to compensate, a player fallen from a hit does not affect the puck or the players around him. Offering the hitter praise, without the repercussion of having to deal with a body interfering with a play. EA let's you add your own tracks which is a huge plus, with customizable menu music, goal scoring music, pause music, fight music (extremely detailed, and for those who don't have much of a preference you can simply select all and put one or more of your songs on shuffle, or listen to EA's provided tracks). it's a great game that my friends and I keep coming back to.

I've been playing it now for 3 days straight and for those of you on fence about buying it if you own NHL 10, I'm here to tell you it's completely worth it. While many of the upgrades are small, and may not be noticed right off the bat by novice players, these upgrades add to the authenticity of the overall game. As far as the online/offline modes, I won't cover them since most people are familiar with them as they haven't changed a whole lot since last years edition. What I am going to go over are the small, but numerous game play upgrades that make NHL 11 that much better of a simulation, and a worthy predecessor to last years game of the year.STICK BREAKS/DROPS - You may think this is just a cosmetic gimmick, but stick breaks can happen anytime and completely change the outcome of a play or game. There's a slider to adjust the occurrence of stick breaks which is nice. Also, your player will still try and play the puck with his skates, or get a stick from another player or the bench. It's a neat feature.FACE-OFFS - Another important part of the game that got a revamp is in the face-off circle. Instead of merely winning a face-off cleanly to a defensemen or a winger, you now have the option to tie the other player up, use your skates, or allow another player to sweep in for the puck. Hardly any face-offs look the same, and this feature looks and feels much more realistic.CHECKING PHYSICS - EA has implemented a new physics engine that creates unique player reactions and movements when getting checked. Instead of having the magnetic checking like in last years edition, checks are a lot harder to line up and finish, but when you do the check looks organic and a lot more punishing.PASSING - Another immediate change you'll see in NHL 11 is that passing isn't nearly as easy as it was in NHL 10. You can adjust the sliders, but keeping the passing assist down really adds to the authenticity. Depending on how long you hold down the pass will regulate the speed of the pass. If you make a hard, fast pass to a player that is close he may have difficulty controlling the pass. If you have the sliders adjusted for realism, it's not uncommon for a quarter of your passes to not cleanly connect with the players. Frustrating at times, but necessary for a hockey simulation.CROWD INTERACTION/GOAL CELEBRATIONS - While the crowd interaction was great last year, this years has some small but cool upgrades. For starters the crowd now chants team specific chants, and reactions to goals and penalties are much more noticeable. When you score you can also choose a specific type of celebration that are mapped to the face buttons. While this feature is rather cosmetic, it gives the player options to create their own visuals which is cool.There are more, somewhat smaller upgrades to NHL 11 that make it even more enjoyable, simulation. It will be interesting to see what EA Canada will come up with for next years installment since with NHL 11 they're getting increasingly closer to creating a perfect hockey video game simulation.

The little details are the most important and EA Canada realizes that. If you are a fan of sports game I'm sure you played the new Madden and like me was extremely disappointed. EA Canada proved the Madden team has done nothing to improve the offline experience.This is going to seem a little off but one of my favorite new features is the restricted free agents. They are such a big part of the real game that it only makes since they are in the video game. The tracking of actual draft placement is also impressive. I start my first dynasty as the Bruins and sure enough they have Toronto's first and second pick in 2011. Awesomeness.The Be a Pro Mode is even more awesome this year then years past. Playing in the memorial cup was way more fun then I'd ever thought it be. Go Thunderbirds. The only thing that kind of sucks about it is that if you play really well you pretty much get guaranteed to get drafted by the oilers. Who wants to play for them really...The new stick breaking feature is fun for a while until it happens to you when the game is on the line. The feature its self is nothing to write home about but like I said before its the little details that make or break these annual sport releases.My one complaint is the new collision system. The hits do look completely awesome but why do I have to press in R3 of all buttons to make a hit. I think I just haven't gotten the hang of it or something but seriously it is a pain in the butt with everything else going. It just feels completely unnatural to press and hold in R3 while trying to deliver a hit. The process slows you player far too much and I actually miss about 80% of my intended hits. But like I said that's my only complaint.Overall Great Effort by EA Canada keeping pace.

I've not even bothered to play it because of the reviews from friends, who can't believe EA would release such a product. Not only does it cause your system to freeze often, it also has bizarre game mode problems such as putting two goalies on the ice for your team and only 4 skaters or no goalie at all. There are also problems with the cards you have to buy or win, apparently. Avoid this game mode like the plague...The regular game modes have some \"improvements\" that you may want to avoid. First off, broken sticks are nonsensical, sometimes resulting from a 5 foot touch pass. So Superman plays hockey, does he? The new physics engine is better in some ways but worse in others. There are more big hits but they seem to have little effect on the recipient. While the player physics are perhaps improved, the puck physics are horrible. Backhands are simply insanely bizarre. A 15 footer from the slot will never get on goal but you can do some backhand dekes and shots that completely defy the laws of physics. Backhands with one hand on the stick from behind your own body go inside a 6 inch opening just under the crossbar while you're not looking at the net.Another annoying feature is that CPU goalies are too darn good on realistic scoring chances, even exceptional ones, UNLESS you resort to \"cheese\". Cheese is a term that refers to methods of scoring that work 80%+ of the time. I'm not going to say what they are but when used against you, you may lose your mind very quickly. An extension of the flawed, artificially inflated scoring is that it's harder to succeed as a human goalie as well. You can't control your rebounds or even see the puck when it's loose, even if only 18 inches in front of you. The auto cover puck feature has been removed as well and when you hit triangle on the PS3 to cover the puck, your goalie will often turn to the wrong direction and/or miss the puck altogether.There's also an unseen momentum factor, making it possible for a team to erase a 3-0 deficit in the third period with unusual ease. This completely ruins games online most of the time. The passing is also unusually difficult in some position but too easy in others. For instance, 5 foot touch passes can very easily go the wrong direction entirely, while 50 foot breakout passes up the boards can be executed with precision by veterans like me. However these problems all pale in comparison to the dumbest AI I have ever seen. If you have a 3 on 0 breakaway with 2 cpu teammates, they'll literally just stand around and watch. They'll fall for the simplest dekes on defense and make terrible, awful passes to you but perfect passes to each other. They simply seem comatose out there...Outside of the gameplay changes, a lot is the same, if not worse. The amount of times NHL 11 has frozen on me has exceeded the amount that NHL 10 and 09 froze on me, not slightly but by far. EA now forces auto save on it's customers, meaning the game automatically saves your progress at certain points, sounds good, right? However, it has frozen on me at least 50 games in offline be-a-pro mode and completely discounts my progress. I've had to replay so many games to get achievements/boosts, I wanted to tear my hair out! This was not a problem last year. The game also freezes 35% of the time when I go to edit my Be-A-Pro skater's attributes.To sum it up, there are some small improvements but unless you HAVE to play the online EASHL mode (what a non-stop glitch fest it is), avoid this game like the plague.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Take It From A 17 Year NHL Addict, Don't Bother", "unixReviewTime": 1294358400, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2011"}

Breen \"Canuckster1127\"", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewText": "I've spent more game time on Oblivion than any other game I've owned.  I've played the game on the PC platform as well as on this XBox360 platform.  Between the two, in terms of being able to lose oneself in the gaming experience, my preference is XBox360.  If you value being able to use cheats or mods then you'll want to give this a pass and go to the PC version.Oblivion feature open game play, meaning you can, with few exceptions, choose the order in which you complete missions throughout the game.  There is a primary game mission to follow which is probably a good choice when you first start, until you get used to the rest of the game and then you'll probably find you quickly develop some favorite missions and quests which you'll choose to follow before you return to the main method.Interesting as well is the leveling system which progressively increases the challenges (and the rewards) of missions as well as the available loot and items you can obtain throughout the game.  If you wish the options available to finish all the missions and explore all the available caves, mines, forts, etc. can easily lead to up to 200 hours of game play.Add to this graphics that all immaculate, scrolling that leaves you feeling like you're in the midst of an animated movie which you're directing and you have all the ingredients for a classic gaming experience.All that's missing is a multi-player option, which, when you think about it, is probably more the result of the use of the available resources to make the stand-alone option as good as it is.When you're finished with your character, you're not finished.  You'll find it an easy thing to return to the game and change your character and characteristics and then go through the game as a thief, a warrior, a mage and despite the familiar missions the challenge morphs enough in it's new approach that you'll not mind that and will want to play the game again.Be aware that there are add-ons available through XBox that you will want to look at, in particular the Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine.  The cost of adding these on are high enough (despite the time that has passed) that you'd be wise to buy an edition with those additions on, as you'll save money.All in all, it's hard to imagine a much better RPG.  If you like the genre at all you'll have to have this game.  If you're not necessarily and enthusiast, this game may just make you one.5 stars.bart breen", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Standard by which all other RPGs are Measured", "unixReviewTime": 1309737600, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2011"}

Nice huge open environment with the ability to save anywhere. Customization options for your character with multiple professions to choose from or add to. There are some interesting weapons and spells to choose from. Having the ability to create potions and poisons with some interesting effects. Having a marker placed on your map for the quest you are on helps finding the destination much easier than Morrowind, but takes some of the fun out of finding it. The game will take months to complete unless you concentrate on just the main plot, but that defeats the purpose of the RPG experience.Combat system was easy to use. After you played this game thoroughly you probably won't play it again for some time.Cons:The balance system used in the game to adjust the toughness level of the creatures to your character level and skill could use a little more work. This feature will make super tough goblins instead of wimpy goblins when attacking the same lair dependent on your character's level. You will die a fair amount of times due to the number of creatures and men you will need to fight. There are tons of quests to accomplish. This is a double edge sword. Lots to do or redundant steps not leading you to the Promised Land. I guess it depends on how you perceive it. Most don't have anything to do with the main quest so it could get redundant.Overall Score: 91/100Some suggestions to Bethesda:Limit the amount of invisibility of items that have Chameleon spells put on them. 100% invisible should not be attainable.Night Vision should also be tempered somewhat like the Chameleon spell.Better thief and assassin missions. Morrowind had better assassin missions.Better stealth meters and improvements based on available shadows and light sources. Currently your character can walk down a well-lit hall and if his stealth skills are way up there nobody can see him.More diversified magic spells.Don't provide the ability to create your own class of character.

In this review I will discuss the pros and cons of Oblivion. I hope you find it useful.Oblivion: RPG, Open World, Leveling System, No Online features.This review contains no spoilers.Please note that I have not tried all available downloadable content (DLC).Oblivion is a medieval fantasy world, including things such as swords and goblins.Bethesda's Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion has earned itself a Platinum Hit award, has received a perfect score of 10 in GameInformer (video game magazine) and I'm sure there are tons and tons of other reviews on this game talking about how pefect it is. All of that is true.In the beginning of the game, you can, of course, customize your character. However, Oblivion has the most intricate character-customizing system I've yet to encounter. You can set the jaw bone, eye color, hair style and color, skin color, wrinkles, face width and many, many more options. You can practically make the character look like the real you in this game (with the exception of possible acne, possible facial hair and height, though the height varies between different races of characters).Pros:Open World - As described in some of my other reviews, many players prefer not to have an open world to explore and would rather just complete designated missions. There are always others, however, who prefer open world leveling up games to explore. So far out of all the open world games I've played, which are about 6 or so, Oblivion has the largest world I've yet seen, next to Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption. I have a character of my own on Oblivion, and so far I've discovered somewhere between 100 and 300 areas, and still I haven't discovered them all. Even players who have several huge world games should not be disappointed in Oblivion's world.Gorgeous Graphics - Close attention to details in buildings, rolling hills, lush forests, snowy mountains, and burning wastelands make Oblivion one of the best-looking games out there. As Bethesda does in many of its games, the facial expressions in the characters, such as smiles and grimaces, as well as facial structures and eye color, are very lucid.Varying Missions - Don't worry about constantly having to participate in the main story, you can always, at any point, stop whatever mission you're currently playing and do whatever you want in Oblivion's massive world. Missions can vary from closing portals to demonic realms to cleaning a town of vampires. It's going to take you a long, long time to complete half the quests in the game.Leveling system - For those who haven't played a game with a leveling system, it's where you kill a certain amount of enemies and complete several missions to increase your level, making you stronger and more durable. Oblivion's level system is fairly simple, but is always exciting when you do manage to level up. You automatically gain more health and deal more damage, and can choose to increase specific attributes to enhance your character, such as running faster or being more persuasive.Several Fighting Styles - Oblivion has a fighting style to suit everyone's preferance (besides guns, Oblivion does not contain modern weaponry). You can be a swordsman, a stealthy assassin, or a (rather overpowered) wizard. You can toss lightning at enemies, shoot them with a bow and arrows, take them out quickly and silently from the shadows, even summon undead creatures and demons to help you fight.Cons:No Online Features or Multiplayer- You may not want to play online against or with other players, but it's always nice when a game offers it. Oblivion does not offer online play, nor does it offer multiplayer. It is solely a single-player game.Maturity Rating - Oblivion has little to no gore, if anything it's some drops of blood coming out of your enemy when they die. Not much sexuality, but when you loot enemies you are allowed to take their armor, which can reduce them to their underwear. There's some alchohol in it, but it isn't monotonous. No smoking, and practically no swearing, besides maybe 3 or 4 occasions of someone saying \"damn\" (which, in a game this size, isn't very notable). I usually add the maturity rating as a con if a game has earned one.Well that's pretty much all the cons I can think of off the top of my head. Numerous pros, surprisingly few glitches, considering how big the game is, tons of missions and ways to fight, leveling system, and very little maturity in the game make Oblivion an obvious choice if you're considering buying a role playing game.I hope this review has been helpful to you.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Review on Oblivion, Include Pros and Cons", "unixReviewTime": 1290902400, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2010"}

Back in the day, I had a Barbie gymnastics game for my PC, and ten years later, I liked the idea of playing another game that was perhaps similar to it.  I immediately purchased this game a month ago, and I am more than pleased.First off, to address the concerns of young children being bored or confused, I understand where these are coming from.  However, this game is about reflexes and hand-eye coordination, something many young children lack for a while.  I find this game pleasantly challenging (though in a month, I have beaten both career and quick play mode), and would expect young kids to find it very challenging.  However, the game gets harder progressively so as kids get used to gameplay, they are once again challenged.The moves are authentic, and despite gripes about graphics that other reviewers have voiced, I'm personally in favor of fun over beauty.  I think the graphics are decent, as in, you can clearly see what the gymnast is doing.  I'm not really looking for anything else other than that.Overall, the game is addicting and simple fun.  The controls are something you have to get used to at first, but the game walks you through them before you get to any serious competitions.  Once you beat a few competitions, you can begin creating your own routines, and as you win more, you unlock new moves.  The game keeps you on your toes, and often has you pumping your arms to give your gymnast power, so it's better than sitting stationary while playing a game.Shawn comments during your routines, cheering you on when you score a \"good\" or \"perfect\", or reminding you to stay focused when you score a \"bad\".  For the most part, bad marks don't affect a routine, unless you mess up a landing.  On bars, your gymnast won't have the momentum to swing back to the top, so you'll see her struggle to get back up, and on the vault or floor, your gymnast can either stumble or fall backwards if she fails to stick her landing.

I pre-ordered this game despite straight up disgust with id's previous title, Doom 3, so I take full credit for the sheer lack of foresight that led me to waste $40 on this title (I had $20 amazon VG credit).  However, that doesn't excuse the awfulness in this AAA title.First, the praise.  RAGE is technically impressive in many ways.  The character models are very detailed, and the creature AI is among the best in any shooter -- if not the best.  Mutants will perform incredible acrobatic maneuvers using the environment.  Enemy bandits and soldier will take cover and work as a team to flank you.  Combined with the many weapons and ammo types as well as sentries and bots, it's quite fun, but ultimately a very shallow experience.\"Megatextures\" are the major new feature in id's new engine, id Tech 5.  It allows the game artists to paint directly on the environment's multi-gigabyte textures, which makes for some impressive scenery.  However, it does nothing to improve the actual gameplay, and I often found indoor environmental textures to be rather low quality and straight up bad.  Overall, they seemed to cancel each other out.  Give me deep gameplay over superficial graphical features any day.One of the major complaints about id is that they make great tech, but awful games.  RAGE certainly feels that way.  Like Doom 3, it seems like a tech demo.  They created what seems like an amazing game world, but it's shallow and linear to an extreme.  For example, you have the ability to jump, but often rails that would be easily jump-able in other games serve as invisible walls in RAGE.  It's frustratingly bad.  Furthermore, aside from very rare exceptions, there's no reward for exploring the very limited environments.The paths through levels are designed to be convenient at the expense of logic and immersion.  With every level, you fight your way through linear corridors and end up conveniently near an exit.  In one instance, you have to fight through the sewers to stop bandits from contaminating the well.  The treatment facility room, where the level ends, has an exit right into town.  Well, why didn't you just start there to begin with?  Why did you take the long way around?  Horrible design decisions like this plague RAGE and destroy every bit of potential this game had.There are boss and mini-boss battles throughout the game, but the final battle is completely anti-climactic.  It's so utterly disappointing.Oh, of course there's also the buggy that you use to travel from location to location.  In town, you upgrade the buggy by earning racing tickets by racing and engaging in other buggy challenges.  It's a decent feature, but I wonder if it was really necessary given the extreme linear nature of the game.Overall, I really didn't like RAGE.  I could not recommend this game to anyone, and there's not a chance that I will ever pay full price for an id game again.

It looks like this is another game that I fell for the hype on and is NOTHING like advertised.This is a SINGLE PLAYER review.This is a Fun, Short, game... Worth a rental on a console but not to be bought on a PC.I beat the game in about 8 hours, so I played it all the way through. This is even after, and I use the term loosely \"Exploring\" and doing \"Side missions.\"It runs fine on my computer at the in-game locked rate of 60fps at 1920x1080 Resolution: A quad core 3.0ghz Intel chip, with an evga 790i ftw digital motherboard and a 460GTX Nvidia card running graphics and an Nvidia 9800gtx+ handling physics (when applicable). Windows 7 x64 ultimate, and 16gb of DDR3 1600 ram.I'm going to break down how badly this game missed the mark by using the very lies that were in the description here on amazon...\"-Visceral 1st-person gunplay and exploration - Take on bandit gangs and hordes of mutants using an arsenal of exotic weapons and special items,Such as wingsticks, personal turrets, sentry bots, and remote-controlled bomb cars.\" --- The gunplay was fun but most badguys take massive amounts of shots to finally go down and stay down, so most gun fights involve running backwards while reloading to take care of the last two badguys in a \"horde.\" I wouldn't exactly call the amount of weapons in this game as being an \"Arsenal\" More like a \"Few\" projectile weapons and an okay amount of gadgets. And you cannot even pick up the weapons that the enemies drop, they just sort of \"magically\" vanish... Same thing happens with most baddies bodies, they just POOF. Though I have to admit that the enemy A.I. was pretty decent when compared to most FPS games out now.\"-Frenetic 3rd-person vehicular mayhem - Upgrade and customize your car with special parts, paint jobs and weapons.\" --- Again, the wrong use of words. I wouldn't call the vehicle combat \"Frenetic\" I'd call it more along the lines of a bunch of boring driving from point a to point b with a few moments of shooting and blowing up randomly appearing cars in obviously open areas. Though the car customization was very limited as you could choose, at most, two different paint schemes for each of the 4 cars and 1 ATV, it was still fun to upgrade and race. Though no matter how much you upgrade your vehicles, the other racers will always be able to match your speed or catch up (look up Rubber Band Racing A.I.), except in story races where they suddenly don't know how to drive.****\"-Graphics that have to be seen to be believed - Powered by id's cutting-edge new id Tech 5 engine, new Megatexture technology brings the vast wasteland to life in never-before- possible detail with action running at an astounding 60 frames per second.\"*** THIS IS WHERE THE GAME IS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING!! The graphics are, simply put, way out of date!! I mean, Read Dead Redemption on the Xbox 360 looks better than this, even Fallout new Vegas on PC without environment shadows still looks better than this game! I was led to believe that the whole new \"id Tech 5 engine\" was supposed to be all high tech and Next Gen... What a bunch of B.S.!! They don't even give you in game options for graphics other than Anti-Aliasing and screen resolution. There is no day or night cycle, the clouds don't move, I couldn't really tell how good the lighting was because it just seemed they would use massive amounts of bloom to emphasize bright light. Everything seems like it is out of focus or blurred, even looking at a big yellow and black Rail Road Crossing sign the RR and black line just seem, out of focus... Sort of like they were using 256bit map images for graphics instead of High Definition sized images. (it just seems this game was made purely for the outdated Xbox 360s DX9 system, or they didn't want to go to the trouble to use HD graphics) There is also this, annoying, \"POP IN\" of images and textures. If you suddenly look or spin left or right or up and down, the images and textures pop in a second later. There were just TOO MANY things going wrong here to make the game immersive.***\"-An expansive experience - Beyond the first-person action and vehicle combat, RAGE offers a world open to explore, with unique characters, side quests, and a compelling storyline.\"*** I absolutely HATE when companies label their games as \"Open World\" without knowing what that actually means. I don't know what their definition of \"OPEN WORLD\" is but it certainty wasn't GTA San Andreas, or Just Cause 2, Fallout 3, and New Vegas open world, or even on a lesser note, Fable style open world, though I would have to say this game seems to have a similar layout to fable, with less choice. I would call it a mostly linear corridor shooter with slightly open world driving areas and two different \"City\" areas. In almost all missions and areas you can only enter one way and exit another way, Point A to Point B kind of stuff. You cannot really walk up on a mountain and snipe at bad guys or sneak in from one way and avoid them or such, so don't buy this expecting Fallout or Deus Ex FPS choices. As for the story line... it ends WAY TOO SOON! The ending of the game feels more like it SHOULD HAVE BEEN the midway point, if that had been the case, then it would be getting a star or two more.\"-Three ways to play for unlimited action - Immerse yourself in a rich story-driven single-player experience, grab a friend for exclusive co-op modes, or go online for all-out multiplayer mayhem.\" I cannot attest to multi-player as I couldn't care less about multi-player games, and if I wanted a co-op post apocalyptic driving and shooting game I'd go for Borderlands, as it lasts MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, longer, and has infinite re-playability due to its unique weapons system. As stated above, there are just too many things going wrong to make this a truly \"IMMERSIVE\" game for me. Though I do have to give some credit to the facial animations and the top notch voice actors! But the game is just too short to really get me involved with its world.I may update this if ID decides to upgrade or patch this game in the next few months to give PC gamers the game they were expecting, but until then, it's just another console port and quite forgettable after finishing it. No real re-playability for the single player. But it is still a fun game, even with all the flaws and hype let down.---BOTTOM LINE----This is not the big 5 star AAA game it was hyped up to be.Again... It is a fun game on the first playthough... I just cannot recommend actually buying it for the PC at this time.Rent it on a console, because it just isn't the type of game worth owning.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Does not live up to the hype...", "unixReviewTime": 1317859200, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2011"}

The A.I is awesome in Rage, and enemies react to your attacks by dodging, ducking, hiding behind cover, fleeing etc, so good eye hand coordination is a must.Also, when an enemy is down, it doesn't necessarily mean he's dead.  He'll be dying yes, but he can still pull out a weapon and try to kill you :D  The animations are great as well, much better than other lauded titles *cough* Mass Effect 2 *cough*As for the graphics, it's a mixed bag.  On one hand, the megatexture technology allows for incredible variation and detail in the game's textures which makes for a more convincing World.  Basically, Rage is the best post apocalyptic rendition ever seen in a video game..  Although I haven't admittedly progressed very far yet, I can still see and appreciate the variety found in the various locations that I've been to.On the other hand, the megatexture itself is still rather low resolution in a number of areas (mostly interior) due to heavy compression for the consoles.  Supposedly the game engine constantly and dynamically adjusts texture detail on the fly to maintain both visual fidelity and  performance; a great thing to have when playing on machines with low memory ie consoles.But for modern gaming PCs, it's not really necessary....which is why there is a CFG hack out already which overrides the game's dynamic adjustments, so you can enjoy Rage at full quality settings.  If you have a mid range GTX 400 or 500 series card with at least 1GB of VRAM, I HIGHLY SUGGEST generating a CFG file override by following the directions in this guide:[...]The game will look noticeably better.  If you want to take it further, you can try using this CFG file which tweaks the settings even further for enhanced visual detail:seta image_usecompression \"0\"seta image_anisotropy \"4\"seta image_filter \"GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR\"seta image_preload \"1\"seta image_lodbias \"-2\"seta image_ignoreHighQuality \"0\"seta image_ignoreLowQuality \"1\"seta image_useCache \"1\"seta image_cacheMegs \"1024\"seta image_cacheMinK \"128\"seta r_renderer \"best\"seta r_multiSamples \"4\"seta r_useRenderThread \"1\"seta r_skipBump \"0\"seta r_skipSpecular \"0\"seta r_cgFragmentProfile \"best\"seta r_cgVertexProfile \"best\"seta vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly2 \"8192\"seta vt_pageimagesizeuniquediffuseonly \"8192\"seta vt_pageimagesizeunique \"8192\"seta vt_pageimagesizevmtr \"8192\"seta vt_useCudaTranscode \"2\"seta vt_maxppf \"24\"seta vt_maxlockedpages \"256\"seta vt_minlod \"-2\"seta vt_lodBias \"-2\"seta vt_maxaniso \"4\"seta vt_qualityhdplossless \"1\"seta vt_qualityhdppower \"0\"seta vt_qualityhdpspecular \"0\"seta vt_qualityhdpnormal \"0\"seta vt_qualityhdpdiffuse \"0\"seta vt_qualitydctpower \"100\"seta vt_qualitydctspecular \"100\"seta vt_qualitydctnormal \"100\"seta vt_qualitydctchroma \"100\"seta vt_qualitydctluma \"100\"seta vt_restartIf you play at 2560x1600 like I do, then you don't need to set multisampling above 4.

Unfortunately, the game really does not look very good. If you are someone that keeps up with all the latest first person shooters, then I will try to describe what it looks like at it's absolute best:Homefront with better animations and character models.I hate to say it but there is a serious amount of detail missing, and on top of that when you turn quickly you will see texture pop-in....I assume this is because it was designed to be played with a controller, and controllers cant move around as quickly as a mouse, thus eliminating the problem.....for console players at least.So for a game that took so long to make and was being promoted largely around it's graphics alone, it can be pretty disappointing. If you are a hardcore PC gamer, I can pretty much say for sure skip this one simply because it is missing all those features that people want like being able to change the FOV and not having a frame rate locked at 60fps (people with 3d setups are screwed), you can't even do SLI or Crossfire with the game...not that it would matter considering it really is not very taxing due to the lackluster textures. Even John Carmack released a statement saying that concentrating on the console version ended up hurting the PC version so there isn't even any denying it.So is there anything good about the game? Well...yea, but I seriously doubt you will find anything that you haven't seen before and don't buy it expecting to test out a new system because it's not that kind of game, the only graphical options are AA, resolution and gamma...no joke.I enjoyed the gun play aspect of the game, if there is one thing ID won't get wrong, its shooting at stuff although the difficulty is way, way, too easy. I even found myself enjoying the driving parts of the game (possibly more than the main portion). The driving parts play like the old Twisted Metal games from PS2 and I found that to be entertaining overall.I just can't in good conscience give this game a high score after paying $60 for it and basically not getting what we were promised. The porting issues with PC games only seems to get worse and worse and the only time we can hope for a short reprieve is when the current generation of consoles starts to become stagnant and people start coming back to PC gaming.I say yes, play this game and enjoy yourself. But please, do not pay $60 for it. If you are getting the PC version, I can almost guarantee that you will not be getting your moneys worth.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "RAGE is not a terrible game, but definitely not a great one either", "unixReviewTime": 1317772800, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2011"}

You do have to use Steam for the game, but in the Steam engine it is possible to set it to play offline.  Plus I personally like Steam because I can play the game from either of my computers without the disk in the drive, and each computer can play the same save files.  It's also a great way to have a digital backup copy of the game in case the DVD gets damaged.As for the game itself I feel that I can't give any stars, and I really can't even talk about the gameplay.  I had purchased this game a while ago and still have no luck in trying to get it to work.  After hours of chatting with support from steam and Bethesda no one can figure out why it won't even start properly for me.  My computer meets and exceeds all requirements for play, and there are no conflicting hardware issues. I did speak to one person who was a little \"candid\" about the issue and explained that iD was a big reason this game has so many issues, and Bethesda is trying to fix the issues as fast as possible.  I personally do believe that because from personal experience I feel that Bethesda makes amazing games. Their games do usually have some minor issues, but the issues get worked out pretty fast with updates. I have a lot of Bethesda games and this is the only one that I have ever had serious issues with.It seems like this game might be fun and interesting if it worked.  If you do buy the game and get it to work I hope you enjoy it, but be warned that there are major bugs which prevent some people from even playing the game properly.Update - 9/1/2012So it's about 9 months since I purchased this game.  Until this week I could never get it to work.  As stated before; Bethesda said they were working on many common issues, but none of the updates corrected the problem.  My old video card was compaitble with the game,but apparently that was the issue.  I recently upgraded the memory card to one that the game says is \"unsupported\", but for some reason it actually works now.  I am not sure why a supported video card wouldn't work and an unsupported card actually works, but hey I'm happy that I can play now and it wasn't a total waste of money.I started playing the game and found it to be pretty interesting right from the start.  I amost feel as if the game is somewhat like Fallout 3 or new vegas, but with a lot less extra stuff.  By this I mean that while you can drive cars with weapons, shoot bandits, and play as a FPS it still lacks depth.  You get missions which are pretty much straight forward.  You do get some quests randomly or by looking at the jobs board in town, but they aren't anything too special.  In games like Fallout you were given missions but allowed to do whatever you wanted because it was an open ended sandbox RPG/FPS, but this game you get missions and most times if you don't want to do one of them right away theres really nothing else you can do.  I don't want to give any story away but the first town sends you to a second town after the first few missions.  You meet the people in the second town and get about 2-3 missions from them.  Then you go back to the first town and get a few more missions, but going back to the second town the gate is closed and the guard says the people have decided to pack up and move on.  After you get sent to the third town you can go back and visit the first town, but really there is nothing to do and no one really worth speaking to other than the shop owner.  The guy in the first town which gave you the missions goes to another town for \"a few days\" which really means hes pretty much not coming back anytime soon.  Not to mention the fact that the map you can drive around on is basically a big closed area that allows you to go to about 5-6 places that have no reason unless a mission is telling you to go there.  Most of the time these areas are actually restricted until you get the mission.I think this is a great game concept.  Somewhat similar to Fallout but less of an RPG and more of a FPS, but I honestly feel more like the character is an errand boy as opposed to a \"hero.\"  I've been playing a lot since it started working this week but I'm already getting tired of playing.  If you like linear games that give missions and are mainly a FPS you might enjoy this game, but as a fan of most FPS and RPG games I'm not that crazy about this game.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Waited 5 months to write thisreview and it still won't work. - Updated 9 months after buying", "unixReviewTime": 1337040000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2012"}

The game looks pretty good on my two-year old Radeon 5850, though there are some mip-mapping artifacts at far distances.So far I have no technical issues.  The game comes with it's own utility to set the optimal settings for your system.  The game did not recommend the highest settings, so the engine must have some feature improvements typical of the older id software titles, designed to run for the latest video cards.Gameplay-wise Rage is like how other reviewers have stated: somewhat repetitive.  But there is a progression of weapons and inventory and equipment, like your cars, so that gives me something to look forward to in upcoming missions.I'm playing on the Hard difficulty and it's just about right in terms of a challenge, so far.  I've played a lot of id software games and found their Hard difficulty to be too easy, while Nightmare mode to be too tough.  I like the fact the game will let you carry all sorts of weapons, since I'm used to that style of play.  Compared with Duke Nukem Forever, it was a pain to be limited on the weapons, even though they upped the carry maximum to four guns.I never played Borderlands so can't say how it compares.  But I have played the STALKER series and this game somewhat reminds me of that, except in STALKER there are no vehicles.  In STALKER you would meet up with NPCs would could give you optional quests to take, and you could build up a list of quests to do in any order.  Rage appears to have a similar quest-gathering system.In Rage there seems to be lots of areas to explore as you run back and forth between the quests given to you by the settlements.  I remember Doom 3 had a quest-like system with the recordings you would find around the base, but in Rage the quest system is handled better.I'll update my review later after I have gone through more of the game.

The AMD driver update makes the game playable, but you'll still encounter tons of graphical glitches, problems etc. Some of this makes it less fun to play and a little less pretty, other glitches make it a complete waste of time. If you're running and gunning maybe low texture quality won't be that big of a deal, but don't stop to admire an outdoor vista! You'll think you were playing a game from 1997.The glitches that really suck are when characters don't draw correctly and turn into a mess of geometry and ghosts of that character being drawn in and out of different positions, with different weapons. It certainly makes the cities seem... alive, if not seizure inducing. You can also see enemies drawn through walls in weird ways, and shadows can go across walls/floors when the enemies are actually a floor above you. I've experienced this all, with a top of the line system and the most up-to date drivers.You cannot change most of this - it's a console port so there's no way to adjust any graphics settings aside from AA and screen dimensions. Nothing else. Now, if you follow some community hacks to try and get the game to work there are config files and console commands that can attempt to force the game to work at your systems capability level, but this is rather technical and a real waste of time since it doesn't really fix anything, just slightly improves the badness.Now - once the game is fixed up it'll be much prettier and the fun potential is all over the place. Bu there's no multiplayer, the RPG elements are wholly without any interaction, any choice, and since all you do is click \"E\" when facing a character that can talk to you, any sort of replay ability is going to be reserved for those that enjoy driving between cities, doing menial tasks and not being able to skip through cut scenes, character dialogue and any other part of the time wasting that's marketed as RPG.Finally, just a couple more indications of what this game is about - the bar in the second city has a man smoking a cigarette in it... well it's random when you load, but he's either got the cigarette in his hand, or it's floating mid-air about 2 feet away from his hand. It at least follows the movement to take a drag, but again, kind of a near miss when the guy is 2ft away with his smoke.In terms of AI, stare at some enemies that see you, fire at you, watch you step into a doorway and you'll be met with a near continual loop of \"where'd he go?\" coming from them. Apparently the AI doesn't know how to move, and doesn't understand anything beyond Peek-a-boo.There's some fun elements, there's a lot that could have been fun, and if they ever fix the game the graphics will probably be great... if they fix it. Just don't buy this for PC, if you want to play it, it's really not as great as all the pay-for-review sites say, but it is fun. It'd even be a great $30 console when that time comes.

It has the feel of DOOM 3 when you're doing missions, and a pretty decent adventure feel outside of mission areas.  It is basically completely linear though, so if you are looking for an expansive adventure this probably isn't for you.  Don't expect Fallout.The graphics are great, when they aren't getting jacked up.  And there lies the problem, I don't know if the problem lies with video drivers or is really an Id Tech 5 engine screw up, but it seems that this game wasn't tested at all on PC because the graphics are very screwy.The texture popping is very prominent, the only things that are fully rendered are those that you are looking at, an area is never fully represented so any time you turn your head, there will be a texture pop.  Fairly often (about once a minute) a wild shape will jut into the screen, which is sometimes bright enough to make you physically uncomfortable.The vehicle portion of this game has been given WAY too much credit by it's makers.  The buggies handle pretty awfully, and nothing like a real buggy, or any kind of car.  Vehicle combat is something you will quickly realize is no more than an annoying gimmick.  Enemies have insane maneuvering abilities and can annoy the hell out of you.The sound is one thing I have really had a problem with.  This is the one game I own that has messed up sound placement.  I have fully updated drivers but I still have problems.  The big thing is that an enemy thirty feet away from you and to your far right can sound like it is directly in front of you, inches away.  In a game where sneaking has its benefits, this really ruins the experience.If they fix the tech problems, I'll give this game a 4 or 5, but until then I can't do better than a 3.

The game would be great if it wasn't plagued with flashes of random jagged images that ruin your view on a regular basis. I am able to play games like Batman Gotham City, Skyrim, Fallout NV and other games on high detail with no problems.Also, the way the game renders is aweful. If you are looking forward and remain still, it is clear as day and is very detailed. As soon as you look right or left, it must re-render the terrain that you are looking at from scratch. If you look back to the front, it must re-render it all over again. It's very annoying.Another reason that I dropped my score is that when you are driving vehicles, you can't look around at all. So if you are taking fire, the only way to know where it's coming from is to get out or off the vehicle and look around. This will play into the linear style of gameplay and the unnecessary reasons for free roaming exploration. What I mean is, when you are driving around, if you think you saw something off to the right, there is no point to get out and explore since you can't look left or right unless you stop and get out. Also, if there is a building, they are all locked until you are specifically sent there. There is zero reason to get out and enjoy the scenery.There isn't a lot of reason to roam the map and look for many items. They are all on the way to your next destination (Linear gameplay). Just look around the immediate area that you are already required to go to. If you decide to go off on the map and explore, it's pretty pointless.If you ever decide to take on the armed buggies outside town, they will just respawn and take all your ammo. Ignore them. Trust me.If I want to play a racing game, I will buy a racing game. Make it an option to race and not a requirement in order to continue the game. 4-5 hours into gameplay you are told you can't have the supplies unless you arm your buggy. You must go to some jerk at a garage to arm your vehicle. You have $$ but that is useless. He says that you MUST take part in races to earn credits that will be used later to arm your buggy with guns. Then and ony then will the sheriff give you medical supplies. (What does a sheriff care if I race my buggy and arm it with guns and what does that have to do with medical supplies?) Also, why is a sheriff giving out medical supplies? Isn't there a supply store?

Even though Unreal Engine has seemingly become much more ubiquitous than id tech.And RAGE is definitely impressive. The detail is sharp, but the draw distances and levels are truly grand. I'm not sure how it stacks up with like the Frostbite engine, but it does a pretty good job.This is basically two games. One is a shooter component. The other is a demolition derby car component. Both are done well enough. The enemies are standard fare, but they have some tricks. Like, melee enemies will juke and dive like Emmitt Smith while they run towards you. range enemies use cover well and so on.The enemies also seem to have an inordinate amount of HP. Which results in rattling your rifle and running out of ammo trying to kill them. This is a little frustrating, since one of the joys of shooters is seeing the enemy go splat with a quick shot. Here, you shoot and shoot and they keep on coming at you. When you finally kill one, it's like an eventuality.The game world has some neat art stylings, but it was also very linear. Yes, it is open-world, but you really can't do much with it other than go to quests. And the quests basically go like, enter area. Shoot up stuff. Get to to end of area. Door to outside magically appears. step out door. go back to base.There are some areas of creativity in manufacturing stuff, but mostly it's just shoot everything in a room till it's dead and then move on to next area. And shooting everything in room till dead takes some time since the enemies have a lot of HP.The interface is truly bad in this game. ID is supposed to be a PC company, right? So why is everything consolized? The worst offender to me was weapon switching. You can only switch 4 weapons at a time, despite carrying 9.

{"reviewerID": "A3V6Z4RCDGRC44", "asin": "B003ICGL7I", "reviewerName": "Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...", "helpful": [12, 14], "reviewText": "A post-apocalyptic FPS / vehicle combat game, \"RAGE\" attempts to deliver fast-paced gameplay but bogs itself down with unnecessary RPG elements.\"RAGE\" is the product of Id Software, better known for games like Doom and Quake.  RAGE attempts to incorporate both on-foot shooting and third-person buggy-driving combat as part of an \"open-world\" concept. Its setting is heavily based on Mad Max and other post-apocalyptic standards; following a comet strike on the Earth, the surviving humans basically turned into the cliche division of honest settlers and evil raiders in football gear. Really, there's not much more of an explanation beyond that: you play an individual with special technology who was locked into a survival pod before the comet hit, and when you emerge there's \"raiders and stuff\".A low-story game isn't a bad thing - that allows it to focus on gameplay, after all. However, despite their barely developed setting, the game insists on trying to shove story in where it doesn't belong. The game advances primarily through doing quests, and doing quests basically means going to talk to someone before going to the next \"shoot everyone on this linear path\" dungeon. The story is incredibly lackluster (the good guys are named the \"resistance\" and the bad guys are named the \"authority\", and there's no real explanation why one's good and the other's evil), and really it just serves as an obstacle to shooting things. In one case I was doing a quest so that I could do a quest so that I could do a quest - three nested quests for one routine mission. They're the usual fetch-quests and \"go kill everyone in this building\" quests, but they seem ultimately pointless.To be fair, when the game does get to the shooting, it's pretty decent. There's two main kinds of enemies: humans and mutants. Humans mostly use guns and grenades, meaning that fighting them involves using cover and tactics. Mutants rush headlong with claws and occasionally slow-moving projectiles, which means that fighting mutants is much more fast-paced. Human enemies have a lot of variety in design terms (different gangs and so on), but not so much in actual combat terms. The game's occasional bosses are more gimmicky than reflexive; the one that stands out the most clearly is a giant mutant who targets you with highly visible attacks while you shoot at him with an infinite-ammo rocket launcher.There's a decent, if standard, collection of guns in the game, including pistols, shotguns, machine guns, rocket launchers, and so on. Each weapon also has three types of ammo, which provides some diversity. None of the guns were really worth getting excited about; the crossbow's mind-control bolts are the only vaguely unique thing, and all they let you do is blow up one guy. The rest of the ammo types are either \"does more damage to x enemy\" or something simple like exploding ammo or lightning ammo. One element that mixes it up a bit is the presence of support items. These items include basic things like medkits and grenades, but also encompass more advanced tech like radio-controlled explosive cars, sentry guns, and deployable robots. One such item, the \"wingstick\", is a razor-sharp boomerang that serves as the game's main logo. These items are relatively interesting and add some variety to the run-and-gun process.The other main part of the game is the driving segments. Over the course of the game you will obtain buggies of various kinds which can be used to drive from area to area (you can also walk, but naturally it takes longer). Buggies can be upgraded with better engines, armor, weapons, and so on by winning races. The vehicle combat is fairly solid, although it's more of an obstacle than anything - you're trying to get somewhere, there's some enemy buggies in your way, kill them. It might be more interesting if the world was actually open, but it's not. RAGE's world is a winding set of paths with a few branches; there's no real exploration because every interesting place is eventually a mandatory quest point. At one point I found a mortar outside an enemy base and was curious about it; it turned out to be a quest item like five minutes later. Everything interesting is something pre-planned, and there's not a lot of \"hey I found something pretty cool\" moments. The game has crafting based on ingredients you can find around the world, but the linear maps means that \"finding ingredients\" means progressing forward and grabbing everything you see.RAGE has multiplayer of several kinds, including shooting deathmatches, driving deathmatches, and co-op missions. It seems strange that the main campaign doesn't have cooperative play, only isolated challenges do. The game's graphics are decent but uninspired, drawing upon a tired array of post-apocalyptic concepts with the occasional steampunk or Wild West imagery thrown in for good measure. The music, however, was definitely a letdown. The game actually becomes way more enjoyable if you throw on some rock-and-roll or anything fast-paced, because the game's shooting action doesn't exactly match up with the slow, meandering soundtrack.Overall, RAGE wasn't a good game. It was a chore to push through, and the decent shooting doesn't make up for what a bore it is. If it had JUST been shooting, maybe it would have been okay, but the incredibly forced questing and the laughable world bog down the core gameplay by a huge amount. 5/10.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "a chore to push through", "unixReviewTime": 1321056000, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2011"}

It's a beautiful game too, though some of the textures look bad up close - nothing I've never seen before.When you're not driving upgradable buggies and off-road trucks in the desert, you're in various settlements talking to people, gathering up quests, upgrading your arsenal of weapons, crafting stuff (auto turrets, exploding remote control cars, temporary buffs, etc), competing in races and buying and selling ammo and supplies. And when you're not doing that the game will occasionally tell you to go somewhere and shoot stuff in the face. The thing is, you spend a lot of time in Rage NOT shooting which is unfortunate because the shooting in this game is classic id software crazyness: lots of circle strafing avoiding slowish moving projectiles, bashing enemies that get close to you and blowing stuff apart with shotguns (among other weapons). Fans of Doom will feel right at home with the shooting. And just like Doom, you'll go in a room, throw a switch, and enemies will overwhelm you. Often.The game is too long for its own good unfortunately. The formula of go to X settlement, talk to X person, deliver X goods, return to questgiver or go to X enemy camp, kill X guy or gather X part, return to town gets old a few hours in and the game is rather lengthy for how repetitive it becomes. However for $10 or whatever I paid for it, it's a steal. It's part Borderlands, part Fallout 3 and part Doom. All great games.

Or maybe it simply easier to copy ideas that came before, but Rage is so unbelievably derivative and boring, it's embarrasing.Like many others here, I'm a veteran gamer, and will try almost anything.  Most \"professional\" reviews are garbage, and are paid for by the developer or the studio, so they are never to be believed.  I usually make my own decisions on these things, and Rage is no different.  I was more interested in the actual customer reviews, than the paid for \"professional\" reviews, and as they were overwhelmigly negative as well as consistent as far as criticism, I figured I'd wait until the price was dirt cheap to buy it, which I did this past holiday season.After playing through a good portion of Rage, I am appalled.  This game is simply not even worth the space it takes up on my computer.  It is simply awful, boring, derivative, and has zero personality.  I am truly stunned at how bad this gigantic piece of software is.  An EPIC disaster in gaming development.  All this is even more amplified by the unbelievable HYPE and PR, as well as the uber expensive pricing when it was released.  Just a disaster...1) There is ZERO story.  It is Borderlands, yet much much worse, and far more pretentious.  The graphics and artwork are pretty sophisticated, but they are hollow and meaningless because you simply don't care about any of what you're seeing.  The dialogue and characters are painfully slow and tedious.  There's no personality.  Its dreadful2)  The gameplay is weak and boring. As far as shooters go, it is not even worth playing it to shoot things.  The console themed shooting and damage are just as tedious, and I personally never connected with the action.  The weapons are not interesting, very conventional, and the action is well.... not really that exciting.3) Driving... oh good grief, the driving.  It appears that the driving was put in in order to extend the amount of time you spend in the game.  There is NO reason to drive anywhere, other than the fact that there is really little else to do of value.  Its a collosal time wasting part of the game, boring as anything, and the vehicles are wholly uninteresting and derivative.  Dumb, just dumb.4) Linearity...  not much else to say, but you are on rails.  There is zero movement outside of the predetermined tracks the game is played on.  You drive past these ambitiously designed and drawn structures and scenes, but they are stage props.  There's nothing there.  You can't go anywhere, except the occasional sewer, which is also hyper linear.  No surprises here.5) The Stuff you pick up has no rhyme or reason.  Its wierd stuff, and some of it has value, while some of it doesn't.  If you like shooters with stuff (Borderlands, Fallout, Stalker, etc) you'll want to scoop out your eyes after a few hours playing Rage.Conclusion:  If I paid more than the few dollars I actually paid for this mess of pretentious poppycock, it would have haunted me for the rest of my life.

{"reviewerID": "A8RGWWCC1PVMQ", "asin": "B003ICGL7I", "reviewerName": "NeoTristan", "helpful": [7, 13], "reviewText": "((INTRO))While Bethesda has developed one critically-acclaimed CRPG after another CRPG since 1994, their publishing records have been mediocre at best.  Games like Rogue Warrior, WET, Brink and many Star Trek games have enraged gamers who blindly purchased those games on the strength of their prestigious name alone.  Only FONV was spared of such fate.But just as they were once reinvigorated by a 'hands-off' media mogul, ZeniMax, 'id Software' headed by the Godfather of FPS, John Carmack, has joined the ZeniMax family.  Carmack, wanting to gain financial muscle without giving up his creative control and integrity, turned down EA and agreed to join Bethesda.With a new arsenal under their belts, Bethesda finally published a game that can live up to their TES and Fallout prestige, albeit not without some flaws.  It's Rage, developed by the renowned id Software.((id TECH 5))Carmack, the creator of Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake series, is notorious for spending too much time on the engine and focusing only on the tech side of the game development.  So it's a no surprise that Rage is one heck of a great-looking game on PC thanks to his 'id Tech 5' engine.Colors, graphical fidelity, textures, details and draw distance are nothing short of breath-taking and framerate is rock-solid on nVidia-equipped PC.  The art design is focused on style rather than photo-realism, character animations are highly stylized and vibrant.The game is over 25 GB when fully installed on your PC.((FPS FOR NON-MODERN WARFARE CROWDS))FPS has evolved significantly since Doom 3, the last game developed by id Software back in 2004.So gamers who loves multiplayer-focused FPSs like Modern Warfare, Halo and Battlefield series must be aware that Rage is a single player-focused FPS with one single player portion, one seperate co-op portion and vehicular multiplayer portion.  There is no FPS multiplayer; no deathmatch, no CTF, no onslaught.Also gamers who expect another Fallout or Borderlands must be aware that Rage is neither CRPG like Fallout 3 nor Action slash RPG hybrid like Borderlands.Rage is a FPS first and foremost with a long campaign (about 12 hours main quest alone and many sidequests and minigames to take on and racings to join); I finished the single campaign around 20 hours doing everything and I finished seperate co-op portion in about 5 hours.  Think of Doom 3 with handful of hub towns set in large open outdoor environment in wasteland and MotorStorm thrown in the mix, you have a good idea what Rage will be like.((GAMEPLAY))You take quest, you drive through the wasteland, fight off the enemy vehicles, enter the indoor environment, kill everything that moves, head back to the quest-giver, upgrade your weapons and vehicles.  Take some rest and play some minigames, take some sidequests.  Rinse and repeat.There is no character buildup to worry about and there is no interaction with NPCs or environment.  Conversations with NPCs are one-way.  They either give you quests, barter with you or engage in minigames with you.  Story is bare minimum and an excuse for the action.  You cannot pick up weapons from the dead foes and items you pick up are solely used for your weapon and vehicle upgrades.  It's this rather simplistic and cumbersome gameplay mechanics and lack of FPS multiplayer portion that will disappoint many hardcore Modern Warfare crowds.Outstanding gunplay mechanics, sound effects and awesome graphics with smooth framerate Rage offers on PC are not just for show but a requirement in order for you to fend off endless waves of hyperactive mobs with excellent A.I.  I've never experienced such relentless, methodical and unpredictable foes in FPS genre and you are in for a fight for your life every inch of your way.  Your enemies will coordinate the attack plans to corner you, flank you, flush you, trap you in packs.  And because you are pretty much ineffective in melee combat, you have to use things like sentry-bot, turret, RC-mini car, wingstick and crossbow to keep them at bay and figure out which types of ammo to use and up to 4 different types of ammos can be slotted in any given weapon.While Rage is not a RPG, it packs surprising amount of depths in customization and menu layouts.  Your weapons must be purchased or given but can be crafted, customized and upgraded to your hearts contents by picking up various items and components scattered throughout the world.  Every weapon packs a violent punch and each hit ends with satisfying gore.Vehicular action and controls are very well implemented and speedy racing action (both combat and non-combat) and mayhem are thoroughly satisfying and a nice change of pace.((DOWNSIDES))The game is definitely one of the longest FPS out there but feels so brief and short in part due to its excellency but also because you get sucked into this gorgeous world that gives you the illusion of endless possibilities but gives you very limited amount of freedom.I guess I've been spoiled by Fallout 3 and FONV (even Borderlands to some extent) but it's impossible to look at Rage and not thinking about some what-ifs; filling out this gorgeous open-world with more NPCs, more quests and more meaningful interaction with such a detailed world, but as I said earlier, Rage is a FPS.  But I have to keep telling myself it's FPS, FPS, FPS,...but what if...It's almost a crime not to fill this gorgeous open-world up with enough contents to rival TES and Fallout series.It would have been nice if they put mobs on foot in the wasteland also but as it stands the open-world outside corridor and hubs are a playground solely for vehicular action, and the world, that will take forever to walk, feels so small when you drive around.id Software is no Shakespear when it comes to storytelling department from Wolfenstein 3D to Doom 3, but I can't shake the feeling that the story is inevitable setup for franchise or more DLCs to come.  The story is rather disappointing and the ending might even enrage some of you.Last, but not least, Rage on PC is not for the average rigs.  While not as system resource hog as the first Crysis or Crysis 2 with high-texture pack and DX11, its system requirements are not low.  Remember that meeting the recommended system requirements doesn't mean you can play the game at the max setting.Considering the size of the installed game and incredible graphics, the game is bug-free and stable with smooth and solid framerate.My PC is equipped with Intel i7 950 3.1 Ghz, Corsair 6 GB tri-channel DDR3 Dominator GT and EVGA GTX 460 1024 MB Superclocked; certainly a high-end but not a top-notch system but the game runs at solid 60 plus fps with no texture pop-ups, no screen tearing, no slowdown and loading time about 5 seconds.((STEAMED))Yes, it's steamed.((OUTRO))If you enjoy unique FPS like Crysis, Far Cry, Deus Ex but not fans of mainstream FPS behemoths like Modern Warfare, Halo and Battlefield, try Rage.  It doesn't revolutionize anything new at all for the genre but it feels fresh and unique precisely because it does everything different from more mainstream approaches.However, even if you are fans of Modern Warfare, Halo and Battlefield series, you will find it enjoyable if you keep open-minded.  It offers long main quest (in FPS standard) and many sidequests and minigames to take on.  It does offers vehicular multiplayer portion and story-driven seperate co-op portion.  With the graphic to melt your face and awesome gunplay mechanics, it's one of the best game of the year.((Addendum))It seems Rage is much more inclined to nVidia than ATI and so many ATI owners have more problems than nVidia owners but not every ATI owner have problems and not all nVidia owners can run the game problem free.I am not taking id Software's side but it is indeed impossible for any developers to QA for gazillion cases of various PC peripherals combination possibilities, and no developers ever test for any video cards out there; it's just not their jobs outside creating and developing the game itself.  They simply program for the respective graphic card architectures, not toward any specific video card.First update your respective video card driver and optimize your HDD before installing the game.Make sure you keep your drivers for DirectX, C++ Redistributable and sound card up to date and open up your control panel on your Windows and adjust your nVidia / ATI control panel.  These updates are important not just for Rage but for all PC games all the time.If you have broken quests, character stuck in environment, objects disappears, etc, they are in-game programming bugs.  If you cannot start the game, black screen, no sound, scratching noise, etc, they are usually related to your PC settings and hardwares / drivers.  It doesn't matter if your PC is an uber-powerful top of the line machine or brand new.I can appreciate the frustration for those who cannot play the game while I've never had any single problem.  Unfortunately, you just have to wait for the new updates for your graphic card.New patch from the developers also adds new options for graphical settings.  They also plan to release multiple PC exclusive patches, like 'The Witcher' series, that will give additional modding tools, DX11 options and even higher texture packs that were originally cut from 125 GB size.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It has all the great tools to be a tremendous game but falls a little short", "unixReviewTime": 1317686400, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2011"}

Our hero emerges into the world after been cocooned into the underground shelter known as the Vault - no, strike that: the Ark, the Ark! The year is 2029 and, following a near-extinction event (namely, the asteroid Apophis spiraling down Earth's gravity well) humanity has pealed back the last vestiges of our civilized facade. Small surviving communities fight to the death for the small pockets of land, shelter and water. They fight off brutal bandits, persistent mutants and each other.SHOOT. LOOT. BARTER. UPGRADE. REPEAT UNTIL SATISFIED.RAGE is a RolePlaying Shooter (RPS), although it plays much more like an FPS than an RPG. There is no leveling up and you have no real inventory. On the other hand, you get missions (apparently no one strained any creativity muscle to think those up), you keep what you kill, you sell the junk you do not need and upgrade whenever you can. There are schematics (buy them whenever you find them) that allow you to MacGyver gadgets and customized weapons out of found components.The characters you meet are quirky and interesting whereas your enemies will react to your killing shot (strangely though, not to all the previous ones!).All in all, the game is fun to play and although its replayability is not that high, it is a game well worth of your attention.AS NEO HAS REPEATEDLY EXPLAINED, WE WILL NEED GUNSAnd by \"guns\" I doubt he meant...WingSticks. These are what you'd get if you were to cross a boomerang with a Ninja-star: they may look good in action but I found them to be far less satisfying than a good shotgun. Do not be disheartened though. Every weapon is extremely beautifully designed and they come with up to four different type of ammo.InBioshockone could complete the entire game by first zapping the enemies and then finishing them off with the wrench. In RAGE you can do the same with electric ammo followed by some WingSticks. And, unlike BioShock, ammo is plentiful in RAGE.IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WASTELAND OUT THERE (IF YOU CAN SEE IT)I was one of the lucky ones because my gaming PC has a single nVidia video card and I am running in a 32bit WinXP environment. ATI cards, SLi stacks and 64bit systems are out of luck: the developer did not care enough to optimize the game for them! Hence the number of gamers complaining about this.So, when they work, the graphics are gorgeous. More artistic than realistic and with great light/shadow transitions. Ever since the originalUnrealI always notice the skies of a game and RAGE has beautiful cumulus and stratus clouds, through which the Sun scorches the Wastelands.So, crack open a cold bottle of Kola-Kong, sit back and enjoy. (No, you do not need to keep the cap. Do I need to keep reminding you that this is notFallout 3!).HAVE BUGGY WILL TRAVEL. THE SLOW SHALL DIE.After so many hours raking Pandora for that perfect Chimera pistol, it was inevitable that once I slipped into yet another sand buggy and start roaming desert vistas I would think ofBorderlands. Buggies here are not only a means to travel but they can also be raced around tracks.They are a good addition, the are fun to handle and they offer a nicely done racing component to a shooter game.CAN YOU STOMACH THIS NEW WORLD?The game comes with surprisingly modest hardware requirements for the eye candy it is. The biggest problem is the HDD space - it will hog ...25GB! For a game that is far from being...100-hours long that is on the excessive side. I had to uninstall no less than 4 games in order to fit this on my primary HDD.Now, the rig I am running RAGE is a two years old Intel Core i7, with 3GB of RAM, nVidia 480GTX (updated to driver 280.26) on a MSI Eclipse running WinXP (SP3) - and it plays at a decent framerate but not free of frequent rendering and the occasional tearing. And this is where the game looses its first star: it is not finished.Consoles are sold at cost and the companies make a profit by pricing console games higher. PC games are different. No one...subsidies our PC systems. So, if you are going to ask for 60$(!) for a PC game, it better be PC-optimized and polished to a shine. And when you think you are done, polish it some more.Otherwise what exactly are you selling, the...promise of someday been able to play the game I pay at such a price?FAST! SHOOT THE VALVE THAT CONTROLS THE STEAM.Yes, RAGE comes with mandatory STEAM tie-in. This means two things. First, for the love of God, if you bought the game retail, activate, then kill the STEAM download, delete the local content that managed to slip through and finally reinstall from your disks. Do you really want to wait for 21.6GB to download?Secondly, this means the $60-game is not yours to keep. You can play with it but you have to leave it in STEAM's playroom when done. You cannot resell it if you so decide and you cannot gift it if you get bored with it. I take a full star off for such DRM schemes; however, if this is not important to you, feel free to adjust my rating accordingly.A FINAL BULLET.Although not that original, RAGE incorporates a number of RPS ideas with gusto and style.

Personally this game was very fun for me, it kept pulling me in over and over again. ID did a great job IMO. But not everything about this game is rosy. Please see my CONS.CONS:Overall graphics could have been much better. Personally I am getting sick and tired of Console Ports. Companies \"NEED\" to design games based on PC technology then port them over onto Consoles. This ensures best possible graphics for the PC. Porting a high quality PC game onto the console ensures better Picture Quality vs. if it was designed for consoles. FACT.This game suffered from massive graphics glitches, primarily with AMD/ATI graphics cards, though Nvidia based cards had their fare share of issues.Anyhow after several weeks of its release, most if not all glitches have been resolved, all thanks to game patches and driver modifications and updates.What really pissed me off was this game is way too short.

{"reviewerID": "A271SYCDU6ZWQD", "asin": "B003ICGL7I", "reviewerName": "Patrick Rouse", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewText": "I will start this by stating that I very much enjoyed RAGE from a fun to play perspective.  However, the technical issues in and out of the game do lead to some issues that can't be overlooked.For starters, out of the box I found out that I couldn't immediately play the game because I couldn't install it.  This isn't a bash against Steam or autoupdating by I literally couldn't install it.  It turns out a number of DVD copies of RAGE shipped with incomplete product keys.  Rather than the 15 character keys that Steam requires, I got 14.  After dredging through Steam's user forums for a while I found out what the problem was.  Unfortunately, the only way to figure out the rest of my key was to plug in every letter and numerical character on the keyboard until Steam accepted my key.  I started with 0-10 and went through the alphabet until \"O\" before finding the final letter.  Annoying.  Granted, it could have been worse \"Z\", but annoying none the less.After getting through the product key debacle, I finally was able to install and play.  Immediately after exiting the Ark, you are treated to some of the most beautiful graphics you have ever seen.  After, that the game strips this away and you are left with graphics that are far less impressive.  This is the constant and uneven balance of RAGE.  There are times when RAGE, idTech5 and MegaTexture absolutely live up to all of the hype.  There are moments when the game is simply unrivaled in graphical quality.  Then, there are times when textures are so low resolution that you cannot make out text on in-game sings.  During one mission, there is a picture on a desk to id Software's Tim Willits that it took me a long minute of staring to figure out that was who I was looking at.  While id has talked about a high-res texture pack that will help alleviate this, it is currently absent.The other big issue with idTech5 is texture popping.  Think early Unreal Engine 3, but rather than occurring once at the beginning of every level, it is every time you move through one area and turn around to the other.  While this had been improved with RAGE's first patch, it still is a persistent issue that is simply a flaw (or not depending on your perspective) in idTech5.  John Carmack admitted to this during his keynote at QuakeCon where he described the ideal way to break his new engine.  Back into an area and spin around quickly and everything will be a mess until it loads.  idTech5 lives up to this description and simply cannot be \"fixed\" regardless of patching since it is simply a characteristic of the engine.After the technical issues, the question becomes is RAGE fun?  I believe that it is so long as you go into the game with the right expectations.  If you are looking for a true open-world RPGFPS, you will probably come away $60 poorer, 25gigs of hard drive space lighter and holding a lot of contempt for RAGE.  If you are expecting an id Software shooter set in a more open world than they have ever made, you will come away pleased if the technical issues don't drive you off.  The weapon set is impressive.  The different ammo types and upgrade ability do provide a measure of depth id has never had before, though it does fail to hold up to the level it is provided in other games.  The enemies are fairly varied with the different bandits, mutants and the authority.  The level design is more open and less of a corridor shooter than id's previous games, though still very much on rails.  I almost hesitate to say I won't spoil the ending because it doesn't really end.  Basically, RAGE suffers from the John Grisham ending.  It feels like the campaign stopped just when it was going from great to spectacular and it goes from 60 to 0 in about half a second.  It is a real shame id chose to end the game this way.  If it had continued, I probably would have enjoyed it even more than I did despite the technical issues.Overall, RAGE isn't a genre redefining FPS.  It borrows heavily from other games and is fairly shameless about it.  It doesn't however take the depth of the games it copies from.  At it's core, RAGE is very much a superficial id Software shooter. Everything is deeper than they have ever been with id, but the depth still doesn't compare to other games in the genre.  With the right expectations of what RAGE is, you can enjoy it warts and all.  If you are expecting other games with an id veneer, you probably should reinstall any one of the games RAGE is constantly being compared to and skip id's new offering until you can catch it on sale.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good game marred by technical issues", "unixReviewTime": 1319414400, "reviewTime": "10 24, 2011"}

With all the hype about the amazing and revolutionary graphics engine and weapon system that id Software (the inventors of first person shooters) has made, you would think they would fall through. The game completely is a 180 of what id said the game would be like. The first thing you will notice are the enormous amount of bugs and game breaking glitches especially for ATI card users. The graphics will literally be completely distorted, or the entire game will be blue. How do you fix this? Extract a file from the graphics driver update and put it in the Rage folder. Or you can fiddle around with Catalyst Control Center, or how about the game not even running right unless you have it open? This is completely absurd and should not be like this upon release. I spend a total of four hours fixing this damn game so I could just play it. So you're probably asking is it worth it?Well the shooting is solid and that's a fact. id knows what they are doing and the guns are great and super fun to use. You can upgrade them at stores in towns, and use various ammo types because the enemies do need different approaches. This is by no means a straight up stand in one area and shoot everything. You will die quickly so use what you have available to your advantage. Guns like the assault rifle use regular steel rounds and feltrite rounds which are more expensive but more powerful. The shotgun can use buckshot, but also pulse rounds and pop rockets which act like explosive shells. You get a rocket launcher, sniper rifle, and a pistol that shoots four different types of ammo. There's a decent amount of guns in the game and you slowly unlock them as the game goes on.Shooting enemies is fun because each weapon packs a punch and feels good to shoot. Enemies have great animations and fight worth a damn so the game isn't too easy. There are even some pretty fun boss fights as well. The enemy variety is pretty low, however, you get maybe five different kinds through the whole game with some just swapping out outfits such as different bandit groups. The whole point of Rage is to run around in the world and explore dungeons to complete various mission types. The dungeons are varied and have a lot of loot in them to engineer items such as bandages, wingstick (boomerangs that are instant kills!), sentry bots, RC cars that explode, ammo, grenades, and a whole slew of things you can build in your menu while your on the field. This can be really fun and encourage exploring every corner for junk to sell or use.Now you're probably wondering how the game is like an open world? While the game has a great art style and feels a lot like Fallout that it is trying to copy it isn't in any way. The game has a nice post-apocalyptic art style and has some great designs and pulls of atmosphere, but it falls short because the game has a false sense of freedom. The outdoor areas must be driven (more on car combat later) and can not be traversed by foot because for one it will take forever, and two the other cars will kill you instantly almost. The world has a lot of \"hallways\" that you can drive in that lead to each dungeon, but by no means is it a free open world like Fallout at all.This tends to be very depressing because you can see all this great open land, but it's barren and closed off by cliffs and walls around you. I mean there are only three towns in the whole game, and they are spread out in two different areas that you have to load between. There is a nice amount of side missions as well as races which involves the over hyped car combat. You drive around your car, which controls very well, and do various races to earn certificates to upgrade your vehicle so you can survive out in the \"wasteland\". The combat is fine and all, but mainly serves as just a way to get to your missions in the \"open world\" because car combat out here is far and few between.I also had a problem connecting to characters because you don't talk to them much and they really just give you missions. I also had a problem connecting to the story because while it has potential, it falls short with a terrible and lame ending, plus it just ends abruptly with a poor final mission with no boss fight. Some of the side missions are probably more interesting than the main missions. Overall you're looking at a 15 hour campaign even if you complete every side mission.  I also have to mention that the graphics look good, but there are better looking games out there thanks to Rage's weird low resolution texture problem, but there are some really nice lighting effects throughout.Overall Rage is a buggy, broken technical mess that most people will just give up on. However, the game has solid shooting, excellent weapon design, and engineering stuff is really fun. The false sense of freedom and so-so car combat really bring the game down to just a mediocre experience that will not leave an imprint like Doom or Quake did all those years ago.

This downloaded version cost $59.00.Theme:After an asteroid has hit Earth all that remains is a post apocalyptic world filled with renegades and scum. It is left to you and a few isolated groups that try to restore some semblance of civilization.The Pros:1.) beautiful, smooth flowing graphics (played with 4 Gb RAM and Ge-force GTX 470 video card)2.) atmosphere for buildings, tunnels and sewers...spooky ambient lighting, shifting shadows, dripping water and goo, creaking pipes, the sound of scampering unseen feet. The opening quest in Subway Town will have the hair on your neck standing up.3.) a nice balance between FPS individual enemy fights and 3rd person vehicle battles.4.) a competitive racing game (within the game) that allows you to earn cash and credits to improve cars, weapons etc.5.) as well as the single player mode, there is co-op with friends and a random game for battle other player on-line with your cars.6.) enemies are quick and devious, often in packs...making them a challenge to take down.7.) a crafting scheme that allows you to make several important objects from scavenged items.8.) a quick access system (with the use of F1-F4) allowing you use items (weapons, bandages, grenades etc.) quickly in the heat and chaos of battles (both against personnel and vehicles)9.) game saves...anytime!  Best to save very often.The Cons:1.) the cost...$59.00. Pricey!2.) performance issues...I've been lucky to have a set-up that runs really well. After reading some  other reviews, I guess others are not so fortunate. Friends of mine with running issues; many have an ati card in their computer...something to consider before spending $59.00 on this game. Hopefully a patch will fix these problems...because, when running properly, this is a great game!3.) with the 'Steam' download...no instructions. Making the initial learning curve a little more complicated than it needed to be.4.) initial splash screens (thankfully very short) and most cut-scenes are not skippable.5.) although the driving world is very open, the quests through buildings etc, is very linear.6.) having played and finished the game, I would say it has little replay value. There would be nothing new to try except playing it on a more difficult level.Impressions:A game very reminiscent to 'Borderlands', but in my opinion, a better effort.The in-game Racing feature, open world driving that usually involves car battles and the quests for objects within building areas turned out to be a lot of fun. The game, once you get acquainted with the game play is a real adrenal rush.As mentioned above, there seemed to be that fine balance between driving and questing that fit together perfectly to provide an interesting and intriguing game.I realize some people are having performance issues, but to me, much better than I expected.  5 Stars.Ray Nicholson", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"Rage\"...The Pros and Cons", "unixReviewTime": 1317772800, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2011"}

Seems like they can't do great things any more.This is basically just Borderlands and Fallout 3/New Vegas done in a slightly different way, only not as well and way too late.The game is not horrible, just kind of empty and lackluster.PROs -INVENTORY - Simple, easy inventory. No 'weight limit' baloney!ENEMIES - Some new creeps with some OK moves to dodge me.WEAPONS - A new idea called a Wing Stick. Essentially a boomerang. Kind of fun.WEAPONS - You get a sniper rifle early in the game!ROBOTS - Having turrets or bots to assist your battles was great fun and I felt this should be done again in future games.CONs -RAGE = LAME CORRIDOR SHOOTER - This is an old school gaming term that means you cannot really go where you want and have few options with how to fight the enemy. Take some cover or fight head on. Nothing creative or cutting edge about that. id/Bethesda phoned it in big time.ENVIRONMENT - It is completely non-destructible.  No breaking down walls or smashing through doors to gain an edge or explore. No shooting ceilings or large objects to make them crumble, then fall upon the enemy for a crush kill.RACES - Lots of races attempt to fill up the lack of game substance.RACES 2 - Once you have enough credits for vehicle upgrades, there is no incentive to race any more.RECYCLING - You wind up repeating a lot of levels for meager reasons!WEAPONS - The sniper rifle is ALMOST the ONLY weapon you really need. I found I could advance slowly, engaging a few enemies at a time and do head shots without even getting touched or being at risk.WEAPONS AGAIN - You don't get the best weapon (Authority Pulse Cannon)until the very end. This might be good thing though, since the enemy AI and battles were not that tough even on the hardest setting.WHIMPY WEAPONS - A few weapons and a few meager upgrades for them....YAWN!!!!!!!!!!!VISUALS - Poorly done graphics on a supposed 'cutting edge' gaming engine.VISUALS 2 - This has the identical cartoon/cell look of Borderlands.VISUALS 3 - This looks identical to Fallout 3/New Vegas.ENEMIES - Crappy AI. Easy to beat on the hardest settings.OUTER MAP - There is no map for you for the wasteland. I WANT A MAP I CAN PUT WAY POINTS ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!INNER MAP - There is no map in the villages to show you locations or guide you.MISSION MAP - There is no indicator or guide as to who is offering missions. So, out of fear of missing everything, you have to drag yourself all over town regularly talking with every character to see if they are offering a mission, 99% of the time there is nothing. Thanks id!INCENTIVE - There is very little incentive to explore the outside world. Therefore, this makes the game linear. There are a few flowers to collect. Hoopity do!VENDORS - I find it annoying that I cannot just walk up and purchase. They have to say something first to you and when they are done, you can interact. Petty complaint but annoying nonetheless!BAD DLC - Did you play the 'sewer missions'? If not, you did not miss anything. If you did, can you even remember them? No, you can't because there was NOTHING interesting or worthwhile about them. First, you have to find them. This was not fun, it was just annoying. Once you clear them there will be jobs on the board asking you to go back (more recycling of levels...YAWN) and clean them out of all mutants. The problem is, this time there is even less challenge, fewer enemies, no extra treasure or goodies that make it worth going back and doing it!BAD ENDING - The ending is just that...an ending. It felt rushed, unplanned and you don't even have any real good battles! You fight off some teched-up muties and then it ends. No big bosses, nothing you did not fight already. The game just ends. The critics slammed the game for it's bad ending and now that I experienced it, I agree. In like a wimpy lion, out like a diseased kitten.WOLFENSTEIN 3D - Overall, I felt like I was playing a game that should have been released 10 years ago. Then it would have been impressive.I could think of another 5 or 6 more CONs, but I think I have made my point.id is what I grew up on! Wolfenstein 3D on floppy disks delivered via the mail! id is like a family member, but now Thanksgiving is coming and I am not sure if I want to invite id to the table this year!Really good DLC might just save this game if they release something with new weapons and enough substance and challenge to it to motivate you to play it some more. Though, with Borderlands 2, coming....and with Battlefield 3 and COD:MW3 and Skyrim all within 30 days of being released, I doubt most gamers will care.Mostly, this game just made me nostalgic for Borderlands.

Unfortunately it never quite succeeds. RAGE was hyped up enormously prior to its launch and I was one of those gamers who looked forward to getting around to playing it. Don't get me wrong,  I enjoyed the game but I was always aware that it could have been so much better. The story is standard post-apocalyptic fare and, more notably, the script lacks humour. The gameplay and combat, while good at times, are never outstanding. It tries to create the illusion of open-world play but in fact it's pretty much a corridor shooter with defined routes and little opportunity to explore. The graphics are also deceptive: the landscapes look good from a distance but close-up the textures are disappointing. It should be noted, however, that the background music is quite impressive. There are echoes of both Borderlands and Fallout 3 here, but RAGE is a subpar game when compared to either. It's a shame that the people who brought us the excellent Doom series failed, on this occasion, to match their earlier success.

Dont hate on this review, but I bought a beast of a rig for Skyrim and decided to give it a test on Rage, so I dont have any of the issues many of the 1*s are complaining about. And with that said:Pros:Graphics - Everything is ultra ultra detailed. You can see the writing on cans and boxes around enemies when you zoom in on a sniper rifle. When you talk to people in towns, their movements are so varied and fluent. Paired with the voice acting, it provides an immersive experienceGameplay - This game has alot of side stuff to do, from hunting down bounties in your car to winning races to upgrade your vehicles, the main quest, side jobs and some REALLY fun weapons (looking at you windstick, and silvertip Xbow).Basically the game is about building up your character and his ride. The more races you wim the more credits you earn, which you can use for vehicle upgrades (cant buy them with cash).The job boards are side quests that net you some quick cash and most of them you can insta-travel to upon accepting the job (sniper jobs are the most fun imo).There's also a crafting system which allows you to McGuyver all the bits n pieces you find in the game into some useful stuffAI - Interesting. It will recognize your presence then rally others to your location. It know's when they have you pinned, when you're taking them out one by one. It tries blind fire, will try to escape or charge you, depending on morale.It's not an RPG but its way more than an FPS.Cons:Controls:  Felt just a bit too consoley. Constantly had to mouse over to the 'accept' key instead of just enter/esc out of stuff. Sounds small, wait till you're 4th hr of gaming, it will be in your top 5 pet peeves. There was some kinda tearing going on when I crouched in bandit hideouts, nothing too gamebreaking.Overall:I dont really have much more in the way of cons. This game exceeded expectations both in graphics and gameply.There are views io this game that looks like straight up paintings. When you talk to main chars (hell, any chars) the detail and facial animations are so detailed you'll swear you're looking at something from a cartoon.The best thing is the ability to switch to other activities when you get bored, outmatched in others.So all in all, it seems like nerdrage is fueling the 1 star reviews.

Nobody does desolation imagery, lonely adventure, thoughtful visuals and suggestive religious iconography like Id Software.Despite this, the game can feel hokey at times, especially in the repetitive buggy driving sequences.

{"reviewerID": "AH0A0JH8S9YEU", "asin": "B003ICGL7I", "reviewerName": "the gamer", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Okay so I waited for this game to be around 10-20 bucks before buying it. I saw video reviews of it for a while and screenshots and trailers. They got me pretty excited but the fact was that at the time this came out for 60 dollars and already there was talk about problems with graphics and such put me off and allowed me to wait before buying it.When I got it I realized man this is a fun game even though there are problematic graphical bugs and just regular bugs. The story is okay maybe even good with some problems with it near the end of the game (I will get a bit more into it later). When you first get some guns and a vehicle and start exploring the &#34;wastelands&#34; you will probably start to really enjoy this game. Its a first person shooter game (FPS for short) that has many different and interesting weapons. Although its not as open of a world as I would like its pretty darn close.You play as a mute character like most games these days and you don't really care to much for his story cause there really isn't one but that isn't bad. You get vehicles which you can upgrade later on in the game and get new vehicles but unfortunately its only a few vehicles at most. The guns and gadgets you get are pretty cool and make the game a lot more fun. Once you get the ability to craft turrets that are either on the ground stationary or actually move (like a spider!) and shoot at enemies you can't help but find it fun.The enemies are a lot better then other games at the time. When you shoot them in the leg or something they actually react to that. Such as limping or jumping or crawling towards you. They even try to avoid your shots by jumping off of walls or grabbing onto the ceiling and such to avoid getting hit. It makes it much more challenging. You also get the heavy class of enemies that have bigger weapons or much more difficult to take down. You also get the ability to loot dead bodies when playing missions to allow you to buy items and materials to make the game more fun so there is also that.A lot of the time your tasked with going to ruins and such to get a specific item or such and have to watch out for bandits and all that. Unfortunately a lot of the levels are recycled so that you basically go through them again but in reverse. Such as going in through the exit you made before and leaving through a somewhat new entrance near where you entered the first time. It isn't a game breaker but iv heard a few players complain about that. I still enjoyed it even though some of those levels I already knew from playing through them once.You do drive at times from mission to mission so there is that but its not really a difficult drive. The racing missions are scattered around and you only apparently have to do like 2-3 at most in order to progress through the story so your not forced to do a bunch but you can if you want. Some of them are fun cause its kinda like mario kart in a way where you can destroy the other vehicle with weapons. Luckily there is no rubber band effect (if you play racing games you probably already know what this is if not look it up on google such as &#34;rubber band effect racing games) so you can end up winning the race by a landslide at times.Unfortunately you don't really meet to many memorable characters and most characters you meet you only talk to a few times for a little bit before never having to talk to them again.At one point near the middle of the game you do fight this really big.. um &#34;enemy&#34; (again not going to spoil it for those who don't want to know just yet) and well its not the best fighting spot iv played but its still pretty fun.The end of the game though is a huge disappoint. You can almost tell that they rushed the game or were busy working on another game at the time *cough* Doom 4 *cough* which really made this game not as good as it could have been. When the ending was coming up I was thinking &#34;no it can't be done yet.. they really aren't going to end it this soon&#34; I could almost tell it was ending around then. It was kinda like &#34;here is the big gun now go kill bla bla and help save us all&#34; type of scenario.What really got me annoyed was near the end of the game you are walking around and you might catch this old guy talking to this other guy talking about a &#34;monster&#34; that was &#34;at least 60 feet tall&#34; and then when you get close and try to ask them about it they just shut their lips and tell you not to ask about it or something. Then after the game and started seeing the credits it hit me that they must have been working and planning out a lot more to happen but then either lost the funding, ran out of time, or were ordered to rush the ending and get the game out as soon as possible. You will be able to see this if you play the game and make it to the credits.The ending level was strange and felt out of place. You drive to this area and are told to take out this enemy to basically save the people or something and you get this very strange level that looks nothing like the rest of the game and go up against these enhanced &#34;enemies&#34; that you never fought at all before with a special gun that what iv heard most players saved and didn't use much because they though they needed it for a final boss fight and then were disappointed by a cut scene. I even heard about players rebooting the last save and playing through it again just incase they might have missed something or that there was a bug and caused them to miss the last boss fight that it clearly felt you were going to have.Ontop of all that after the cutscene and the end credits they don't allow you to go back and explore the outskirts and finish up any side missions you might have had. You basically have to start the game all over again. For those who didn't get the anarchy edition (or special edition) that has a few DLC stuff. Such as a different costume that gives you 5-10% off of stuff in shops and the double barrel shot gun I will tell you this. Your not really missing out on anything. I think it was just a ploy to get a few extra dollars out of you for a few stuff that really wasn't that great. I never tried the extra sewer missions except 1 because I heard it was just an area you go through and shoot a few waves of enemies and get an item at the end over and over again through all of them. The one I played through was basically the same as what I had heard so unless you want to waste ammo and shoot more enemies then your not missing out on much.Recently a month ago or so Bethesda released a DLC that kinda fixed the problem with not being able to go back to the outskirts after the final mission and added a bit more to the game. Unfortunately though it was a long wait for people who bought the game a year before and played through it already. And it wasn't even free it will cost you like 5-10 dollars to get it for something that fixes the game. I had just finished the game around the time they announced this and I know most players who had bought and beaten the game a year before were like &#34;DLC that's a year late on a game I played a year ago is a little to late&#34; so it is nice they finally release a bit extra stuff to the game but like most players felt it was a bit to late.Conclusion:I might sound a bit hard on this game near the end of this review but I really did find it to be a fun game. I heard they are making a sequel to it so I hope the sequel will be a lot longer and have a lot of the problems ironed out but since they kinda focused more on Doom 4 when they were making this I am unsure how it will work out. The ending of the game was pretty weak and bad but I think they made it in a way so that they can make a sequel to it.I would say if you are interested in this game get it. Right now for PC its not to expensive and even though there are some graphical problems at times its still a fun FPS game. If they do come out with Rage 2 I will be pretty interested in getting it but I will probably wait like I did with this one for the game to go down in price unless im quite sure they did a better job on it then this one.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The ending might make you rage but its still a fun game", "unixReviewTime": 1357603200, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2013"}

The characters are neither believable nor engaging, there is a serious lack of weapon variety, it's stupid that you can't pick up enemies weapons when they drop them and over all it just does not feel very deep.On the positive side we have a post apocalyptic world that was not destroyed by nuclear war, which is a nice change, the game does not crash every five seconds and if your just looking to kill time this will do it.

If you can make patches to mostly fix a game within a week of it's release push the date back for release and fix it before releasing it to the public.

If you like games like Fallout, play Fallout it's a much better game. One big difference between Fallout and Rage is Rage is way shorter of a game in comparison to Fallout, if you like a game that takes a long time to beat don't play this one. The scope of the world on this game is very small, and the amount of quests to keep you interested in the game is short.This game had a lot of potential, if the game was stable on release, had a much larger world, more quests, better graphics, updated game play engine to make use of the power of today's PC'S, and a more original story this game would have been an awesome game. But it will most likely be remembered as the as the broken on release poor fallout clone with a horrible PC port.P.S. Although the game is broken even after patches and beta graphic drivers, at least Amazon stands behind their customers. I returned the game and received a full refund from Amazon for the game. My suggestion to all PC buyers that are having problems like I did, go through the refund process as long as it has been within the first 30 days since you received the game, and get your money back from Amazon, and send a message to these game creators, that if we are going to spend our hard earned money on a game we a expect a working game out of the box with the same effort put into making it as they did for the console versions.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Fallout/Borderlands Clone Falls short for PC", "unixReviewTime": 1318291200, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2011"}

I should start with mentioning that Rage is not a bad game at all! It is a whole lot of fun and the FPS mechanics are just as superb as they were in iD's previous games. However, it is obvious that Rage has a TON of untapped potential and is sorely lacking in many areas... I won't turn this into a huge wall of text but will give a few bullet points of things that aren't all that great about Rage:-Multiplayer is limited to car combat - I can't believe iD of all companies would opt out of FPS-based multiplayer!-Story - It tries to have a story... sort of, but it isn't really all that well fleshed out-Missions - You basically just run jobs back and forth for the various NPCs in the game... It gets really repetitive, however, the shooting and FPS mechanics are amazing when you are actually fighting enemies so the game actually held my attention quite well throughout the gameOverall, it is definitely a really fun game. I don't know think there is much replay value here seeing as the multiplayer isn't all that great, but the singleplayer alone has 20-40+ hours of gameplay time. This alone makes it worth the purchase price. If you enjoy singleplayer FPS games and are looking for: great shooting mechanics, amazing feeling/sounding guns, great graphics and animations; then you will probably want to pick up Rage.

For you ATI users simply go to the website and there is a RAGE ATI driver, made just for the game. The only thing i see is a little big of screen tearing. I have it cranked up to full 1080p, 4x AA, so once in a while you'll see it, sometimes not. If i do, i'm engrossed in the game and it doesn't ruin a thing. The graphics look absolutely amazing, and the gameplay fairly easy, yet keeps you on your toes. The AI is quite intelligent, they hop off walls, do flips in the air, come after you with various objects, and call you an S.O.B among other things. I have yet to see any glitches, and i don't think i will. One thing to keep in mind is to make sure your distributable packages are updated, using windows update. Other than that, i can't think of anything else that would cause all the problems people seem to have. The game isn't anything \"new\" under the sun, it's your usual post apocalyptic asteroid hit the earth aftermath sort of game. But that's what a lot of games, and movies are based on today. So don't expect any kind of compelling story. It's just a blast to explore, take in the awesome scenery, and kill off the bad guys. The weapons are very fun as well, aiming is spot on accurate, and hitting them with the wingtip boomerang is actually quit funny. Especially when their heads fly off. As i get further into the game (no you don't have to complete a game to review it in part), i'll update later. So update with the driver (ATI users), Nvidia folks, i'm guessing they have one for you as well. As i said this game looks absolutely amazing maxed out. So don't give up on it just yet.

There is alot of action, and most of it is good.  While there is leveling up, you do not have much choice in skills.  Each character has 3 spells and 3 combat skills to choose from.  The spells are the same 3 for both characters.  Each spell or combat ability has 3 levels, such as lower mana cost, higher damage, etc.  The game is mostly linear with a few side quests that you may discover if you check everything in every level.  Weapons are found in racks scattered throughout the levels.  The female character is an archer, although she can also use a sword, and the male character is a fighter.  He also has a crossbow, but archery is not his strong suit.  The graphics are pretty good; however in the cutscenes there is no facial animation other than the mouth. The combat is pretty fun, but nothing that hasn't been done before.  Everything else about the game including the levels and history are pretty much recycled from any other fantasy game you may have played.  If you want to play single player, the partner AI is pretty descent and you don't have to worry about babysitting your partner.

Set in a gritty and brutal fantasy world, the story follows two mercenaries (Caddoc, a human male warrior and E'lara, a female elven archer) as they investigate the disappearances of townsfolk after sinister creatures begin to emerge from the underground.  Armed with a magic artifact called the Deathstone which allows the wielder insight into the lives of the deceased, Caddoc and E'lara set out to the nearby town of Dyfed in search of its missing inhabitants.  Here are my thoughts on Hunted: The Demon's Forge;Pros+ Grim, dark and adult fantasy setting.+ Hidden areas are fun to discover and explore.+ Excellently detailed character and creature models.+ Humorous and witty banter between Caddoc, E'lara and the NPCs.+ Spell and action particle effects are clean and look impressive.+ Rez vials are a convenient way to revive companions.  Much easier than kneeling over them for a set amount of time while getting beat on by enemies.+ Dungeons have dark and eerie feel to them.+ Blood splatter from combat is a nice touch on characters.  Shields are also destructible.+ Very non-stereotypical main characters.  E'lara is shoot first ask questions later elf who is always more than happy to rush into battle.  Caddoc is a calculating and strategic mercenary warrior.+ Solid voice acting talent includes Lucy Lawless, Laura Bailey and Robin Atkin Downes.+ Outstanding soundtrack by Kevin Reipl (Gears of War, Unreal Tournament, Resistance - Burning Skies).+ Weapons and armor have excellent detailing and design.  Many weapons also have magical effects accompanied with simple particle effects.+ Can see many items you're carrying such as weapons, potions and rez vials.+ Gruesome looking creatures.+ A few good scares in dungeons.Cons &lt;Contains SPOILERS>- Impossible to tell which items you can break and which ones you can't.- Caddoc's crossbow is slow and quite lackluster.- Lots of invisible barriers and places where items can fall behind which you can't reach.- Careful fighting next to \"sleg\" pots, it's extremely easy to drink them altering the ending of the game.- Checkpoint save system which can be really poorly spaced in some areas.- Melee combat against enemies is often extremely dangerous even for Caddoc.- Cut-scenes can often cause you to lose loot that you didn't pick up in battle.- Many areas are one-way only with no option of returning.  If you missed something, too bad!- Some really ugly and dated environmental textures.- Health and Mana potions can disappear even though they still show on the ground.- Some musical glitches where it gets caught in a loop so you can't tell when combat is over.- Finishing maneuvers while neat, lock you into the animation but not your partner which ends up looking odd.- Riddle heads tend to get a bit repetitive.- Some graphics clipping issues.- Limited number of enemy types.- No jump or crouch.- Clumsy cover system.- No inventory option.- Linear gameplay.- Some jerky character movement.\"Hunted: The Demon's Forge\" is exactly the type of fantasy action game that I look for.  Its dark story, grim setting, brutal creatures and unique characters intrigued me from the very beginning.  The teasers hinted at Gears of War style gameplay but in a fantasy setting after which I was sold.  Unfortunately, \"Hunted: The Demon's Forge\" just doesn't live up to such lofty expectations.  The game felt unfinished and largely subpar in so many areas.  The game's faults really show with its broken cover system, linear gameplay, dated graphics, clumsy character/enemy combat, invisible barriers and overall bugs.  Despite these issues there are some bright spots in the game as well.  The character and enemy models look great, the combat is generally fun, the voice acting and soundtrack are quite well done and the overall setting of the game has a very dark and gritty feel to it.  That being said it's still not enough to push this game beyond the average or cause you to overlook its many flaws.

The game has an interesting story that falls flat due to poor storytelling and pacing. You play as a mercenary couple: The human Caddoc and the beautiful elf E'Lara. Caddoc is calm and reserved while E'Lara is all about rushing in and killing everything. The swapped stereotypes are nice, but the overall story goes nowhere until the very end. You get caught up in a mission to stop an evil man named Annuvin who is using a dangerous liquid called Sleg that can turn everything into evil. Along the way the only other part of the story is trying to find a mayor's daughter for a high reward. Not very interesting since the game is linear to a fault, and the gameplay is just yawn worthy.Throughout the game there are points where you can swap between the two and they each play differently. Caddoc is all about melee and brute force while he has a crossbow that does minor damage. I felt the crossbow completely useless since it does hardly any damage (even after you find a few upgrades) and is very slow to shoot and takes forever to reload. His melee attacks are best, but you just mash the attack button ad nauseam. If you block attacks with your shield you can charge a fury attack, but if you get hit once before it charges it depletes. What kind of thing is that? Every so often you will get super charged and do extra damage, but I could never figure out how this happens exactly since it seem to be random.E'Lara is all about using her bow and melee is just like Caddoc's crossbow; useless. You can pick up different level weapons at three levels which are fast, medium, and slow, but she doesn't have a fury meter. If either partner dies you can throw each other regeneration vials, but if you run out you're dead for good. You can also use magic, but it's clunky and doesn't fit right because some magic uses your weapon then you have to switch to just magic which involves throwing stuff. The game is just very clunky and not very responsive and it makes a lot of battles a huge pain to get through.Upgrading magic works, but it's nothing special since there are only three different types and then two upgrades on top of that. You get upgrade crystals by finding them in containers or enemies will drop fragments. On top of this you would think that being an RPG there would be side quests. Not really. You can find paths that lead to \"rare\" weapons, but these tend to be just as useless as the rest of the game and not worth anything. Hell, you can't even spend the gold you pick up through the game. It just increases your score on the leaderboard. You can also find death stones on fallen enemies to hear their stories, but what's the point? You'll be too busy screaming at the clunky combat and falling asleep at the derivative gameplay.Does the game at least look good? Not really. This is another game that uses the Unreal Engine 3 that doesn't use it to its full potential. The game looks average and for some reason has a lot of bugs and constant slowdown even on high-end systems. The voice acting for the characters is good, but since the game is so boring you won't really care. Why should you play through this? The archery in the game is fun at first because at least that part is done well and is pretty quick and fun. Hell, just play to stare at how gorgeous E'Lara is if you want or even Seraphin.

This game is really none of those, i would put it close to the Witcher but that still wouldn't be fair. The game play is very simple, they give you auto aim, and replenishing your health is very easy as well. I've just started through the first parts of the game, and while i'm not disappointed, i can't really say i'm very impressed either. The detailing is great, but the graphics still leave something to be desired. I don't or haven't noticed any bugs yet, but time will tell. It's pretty much like a mid evil version of Resident Evil 5, which i loved because of the co op. On PC it's not going to be like on consoles unless you play with someone online. No one will be sitting on PC with two controllers for co op mode. So your stuck with switching back and forth between characters, which is fine since i play alone anyways. The story is pretty flimsy, though effective enough. The dialogue is about as bad as i've ever heard for this genre of gaming. And everything else well, it's just there. But it does have its fun, and good moments. So as i get further into it, it's just nice to have a simple kind of dungeon adventure to play without having to think about every move you make, and stop and talk to 100 different people throughout the game. If you're looking for that, then stick with Fable and Dragon Age etc.I noticed someone called this Gears Of Sword and they are basically right, the cover system is exact, some of the walls you hide behind are exact, and even some of the scenery(which looks good on highest settings 1080p) resemble Gears as well. Just in Dungeonesque fashion. I cranked up everything and have up to 60fps no problem. So i don't know that it looks dated, maybe just a few years old. I don't think the hype this game has been giving out since last year is at all worth 60 or 50 bucks. Maybe 40 at the most. But it is a decent game, and the more i play the more i'll update. Combat is very simple, spells and magic are as well, and i get the feeling it would probably be better suited on 360 or PS3, but wouldn't look as good. But i do have the feeling also, that the co op on a large 52 inch LED/LCD would be more fun as well. So if you get it for PC expect to play alone, i may get it for 360 when the price drops, or not. So far it's far from the best looking or playing RPG(which i wouldn't call it), but far from the worst also. I'm going to try The Witcher 2 and see how much better it is, i'm sure a lot.

Unfortunately, it's mostly all flash and very little fun.Characters are pretty absurdly imbalanced, and there's an enormous focus placed on aggressive tactics. This game throws defensive play completely out the window with overpowered super moves, combos that (even when blocked) are nearly impossible to counter attack, and assists that are really easy to abuse. And the X-Factor? This just makes the game even more aggressive.The game's designers fully admitted that they had no intention of balancing the game, simply because there's too many characters. Due to this, people just pick the overpowered characters like Sentinel, Wesker, Akuma, Hulk, and Dante, to name a few (not coincidentally, highly aggressive characters). This may sound like a lot of variety, but keep in mind that this game is 3v3, and you're much more likely to run into match ups involving at least 2 of those characters.There's supposed to be balance tweaks coming for Ultimate, but I'm not holding my breath. If they had no intention of balancing in the first place, what are the odds that Ultimate is going to get it right?If you love games that focus on off-the-wall combos, then maybe you'll like this game.

Finally the third game is now on store shelves. Will it live up to it's predecessor? Only time will tell. This review will talk about the different modes the game offers, the characters, and of course, the gameplay.The original Marvel games had very few modes, arcade, versus and training. This game offers these modes, online play (which I haven't touched yet), and mission mode. The gallery doesn't count...Versus mode: You fight with your friends locally. Pretty standard.Online: You can fight other people around the world in a ranked match or a exhibition. From what I've read, there is no replay or spectator system. This is a major drawback as it lessens the community experience. Basically, you end up waiting in a lobby bored to death before having an actual fight (spectator mode makes this bearable in Street Fighter 4)Training mode: Practice combos, using assists and just getting to know the characters and team strategies. You will spend a lot of time here.Arcade mode: Fight the computer until the last boss. This mode can also be used to practice before fighting online. I've that on the hardest setting the AI becomes particularly unfair with psychic blocks and throws but never shows off any real unique combos.Characters: People complain that there aren't enough characters and I think its pretty silly. You get close to 40 right off the bat with DLC along the way. Almost every single character is unique. Like keep away? Dormammu, Arthur, and Chris are really good. Like rush down? Wolverine, Dante, and Akuma are great. Marvel 2 had 56 with like 30 clones, seriously. I guarantee you will find more than a couple people you like.Gameplay: Very different from Marvel 2 and Street Fighter. Combos are usually light -- medium -- hard -- special -- jump -- repeat -- possibly super. This is the general order of attacks but there are many combos in the game. Assists are your partners that help you out for a short time. They are used to put pressure or keep away or gain more meter. You can switch between them in the middle or the match (now in an air combo). The controls are much simpler than before and this helps and hurts the game. Its easier to pull off moves but it feels like every character is doing the same thing. Combo into the air, then to the ground, bounce, more combo or super.The X-factor is new to the game and makes a character very strong temporarily. You can easily kill all 3 opponents with one guy. But you can only use this once. I'm not sure if this helps the game or hurts it. Its just something to help people come back from a beating.The biggest fault of the game is the low health for the entire cast minus Sentinel. Fights can be very fun, so it's very anti-climatic to only combo someone 3 times before they die (once for Pheonix). You can set the damage lower but that should have been the default option.Great game and tons to figure out.

And just like any long-awaited sequel, there will be people who love it, and people who hate it. As for me, I'm a fan, and here's why:Easy but deep: The controls in MVC3 are a bit different than what you may be used to from MVC2. In fact, I think it was harder for me to adjust than it would be for someone who had never played MVC2. I think that, on the whole, the controls are easier to learn and much easier for new players to pick up. The simple control method takes this even further and lets even non-gamers take a swing. Sure, they'll button mash, and it may not be a true competitive match, but I respect that Capcom was willing to let them in. The game controlls a lot like Tatsunoko vs Capcom on the Wii. Despite the simpler controls, it still feels like there's a good deal of strategy for each fighter.Character: I'll admit, I was a little dissapointed that MVC3 didn't live up to it's predeecessor's record of characters. That being said, not many fighting games will give you this broad a selection. And, unlike several other fighting games I've played, none of them feel the same. I wished for a few more x-men on the marvel side, and I'm missing Mega-Man on the capcom side, but there'll certainly be someone for every player on this roster.It's not a perfect game, but the only negative things I have to say about it are more about how it compares to MVC2 than about the game itself.

The prospect of playing as Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk and Wolverine is mighty tempting for a young boy so, when teaser trailers forMarvel vs. Capcom 3appeared last year, requests naturally followed.I wasn't concerned about the voluptuous female characters (my kids turn their heads in disgust when Lois Lane kisses Superman) or the animated violence which is no worse than what they watch on Cartoon Network. The stylized fighting is relatively tame (read: no where near as bloody) as you'll find inX-Men Origins: WolverineorMortal Kombat(BTW: both of those games carry an `M' rating for players 17-years old and up).The characters' dialogue inMarvel vs. Capcom 3is generally engaging and fun but once in a while you'll hear a cringe-inducing line that you hope your kids won't repeat. For example, Chris Redfield is pithy, shouting, \"Eat it!\"; \"Suck it!\" and \"Eat Lead!\" And Deadpool gleefully announces, \"Check me out, I'm the ghost of Christmas kick your ass!\" Along with barbed comments from Spencer and Taskmaster, the game earns its `T' rating for teens.The gameplay is three vs. three, tag-team fighting with loads of special attacks. The simple mode allows players of any age or skill level to jump in and have fun. In simple mode, little time is needed before battling the game's final boss, Galactus. However, I encourage parents with younger players to explore the mission mode to perfect moves, especially X-factor, which creates a glowing red power aura around your character.The game's main disappointment is the lack of an adventure mode that would allow two offline players to play together as a superhero team. I had hoped the game would include more unlockable extras and modes to extend the game life. After a couple hours of gameplay, my sons grew tired of fighting each other and the CPU and returned to playingMarvel Ultimate Alliance, where teamwork is key.In summary,Marvel vs. Capcom 3is an addictive, visual feast.

Newton \"Geek Enthusiast\"", "helpful": [6, 9], "reviewText": "This is a really tough review to write because as a long-time gamer, I have to weigh my experience with their \"VS\" games and the other game it mimics (SF4) and balance that with the innovations (sorta) that the game offers.  Visually it is a treat for the eyes, and it's nice to see \"non-standard\" characters in a game as wild as this.  But spectacle is only part of it.  The gameplay is where the primary focus of contention is.This game has the highly-simplified control scheme of having only four attack buttons.  This is good in that it helps new players pick up and go, but it's bad in any number of other ways.  First, since it has changed so dramatically from MvC2, that means a number of controls have changed on a game level and on a character level.  That means a jarring transition for fans of the older games.It's also disappointing to see characters get their movelists chopped in half or more and smacks of lazy programming in the sense that they wanted to keep the moves to a minimum to rush a game out.  In more traditional VS games and in SF4, the six-button control affords one a great degree of control in responding to an opponent, where as the four-button is definitely less finesse.  While I find that disappointing, some prefer the simplicity of it.  For completeness' sake, MvC2 had a four-button control as well, but that cleaved closer to the six-button traditional, and CvT had a similar control scheme.And speaking of characters ... there's a lot of debate over the roster.  Again, it's hard to complain given that this is really ahead of MvC2 by a great deal ... but it also smacks of gold-digging when you consider the size of the MvC2 roster.  Granted a few of the \"hidden characters\" were merely shameless palette swaps, but quite a few were not.  Also, unlike MvC2 they didn't waste roster space on three \"only appearing in this game\" characters (Amingo, Son Son, and Ruby Heart) so I'm not sure I can complain about wasted roster space.  Alternate costumes are largely well done for those characters that have a large wardrobe (like Spider-Man) and there are some nice gems (such as Punisher-Cap) but to fill out the Capcom side, it might've been nice to see \"cosplay\" outfits such as Ryu dressing like Ken (Heck, it'd be nice to give Ryu his MvC1 transformable fighting style) As much as I'd love to discuss DLC, that does not come with this game (or at least this version) so what characters will be coming or otherwise purchasable is beyond the scope of this review for good or for ill.The storyline is actually slightly more present than in MvC2, no matter what people say.  Having a recognizable big bad like Galactus goes a long way toward explaining the storyline, as opposed to MvC2 which flashed still pictures \"explaining\" that everyone was recruited by a pirate to fight ... some sort of gooey chaos machine?  I don't buy the backstory too heavily (Doom and Wesker hatch a plan involving Galactus eating the world?  Uhhh ...) so I'm glad it isn't really put forth.  I like that all the characters at least have individual endings.  Disappointing, however, that in match-ups, there's no \"fight your rival\" (which would be hard given the random team nature of the game) and that only the lead characters address each other.Game modes are at a minimum; given it's built off SF4, you'd think they'd have a few more options.  Oh, and on a personal level: performing complex combinations isn't a \"Mission,\" it's more like \"Advanced Training.\"  If you want to dole out missions, maybe that would've been a good way to use a single-character fighting system, allowing for rival fights, like maybe a single-character story mode that helps flesh out the overall game's backstory!Overall this game is a good game, and if you can get it for a reduced price, I would recommend getting it.  Despite the visual flair of the game, it feels cheap.

I thought MVC2 was the best fighting game ever! There was a huge roster of fighers of 52 people. Best graphics back then. Its battle system was a bit off, but still way way better than MVC3.This game reminds me of TVC. MVC3 battle system must had came from TVC. That was a big mistakes. In TVC, there is some kind of mega cancel and you can break out of almost any combo from your opponent. It's not in MVC3 but they put something in replace of that. The X-Factor, this makes your characters way more powerful and faster too. This effect can be good thing or bad. I mostly think it's bad because you don't need to give your opponent a comeback effect or yourself this effect either. If you about to win, you'll should win. If you're about to lose, you should lose. That's it! Throwing in this extra X-factor makes it a wild card matches for most of the time. No crazy effect to change things up a bit. They should had used MVC2 battle system. There was nothing wrong with it and it would had made sense in the end too.I bought this game at the midnight release date and the guide too. The guide was made very well and it's just a shame that the game isn't as good. After buying the game, I came home and saw all this flashing animation and sparks flying everywhere to find out that was it was just the background graphics going crazy! At one point, I didn't know what was going and didn't know if I was firing those projections or was it the animation from the background???

If you bought the strategy guide like I did, you would see that Jill and Shuma was already made and give full detail explanations on how to use them both! Why couldn't they be put in as hidden characters as well on the disc? MvC2 would had done that, no question about it.Capcom just had to take out some characters and had to asks people to pay extra for them.

In MvC2, you had several characters with nearly identical clones. Iron Man had War Machine...There were 2 Wolverines, Mega Man and Roll...did they play 100% identical. No, not at all, however you had a few characters that played extremely similar in MvC2...in MvC3 though, everyone is a completely different playstyle. The closest you get is Ryu and Akuma in terms of 2 characters playing similar. With that being said, 2 characters are being launched as DLC within the month (Jill and Shuma-Gorath), which will cut the deficit to 18 characters. I do expect capcom to sell DLC over the next year+, and I wouldn't doubt that by this time next year MvC3 will have tied or have surpassed the character count in MVC2.Now with the discussion of character DLC, people are arguing and complaining about how capcom is \"going to rip the consumer off on DLC that should've been included at launch\" etc. Remember that you're buying this game as-is, and that the DLC is something extra, and usually not-neccesary to continue playing the game online or offline. As is, we got 36 characters for a fighting games, 18 from Marvel and 18 from Capcom. I will welcome DLC, especially if it's for a character I would enjoy such as Carnage, Megaman, Ghost Rider, Daredevil etc. Just remember, you're buying the game and it comes with 36 extremely diverse characters.People who were experts at MvC2, expecting to automatically pick up a controller and make people rage quit online have something coming to them. It's as if this is a brand new game, with ideas from the first 4 games but not the same button config. One light attack, one medium attack, one Heavy attack and one \"special\" attack. There are two buttons for your assists. And if you hold either of those buttons, you can switch your character out for another. So basically, everyone starts off fresh, and it's a simple game to get a hold of. Think of the button controls as a 75% Street Fighter and 25% Tekken. Button mashers can do well, but obviously those who are willing to take the time to learn the controls will do a lot better.Mission mode is one of the new additions to the game. Each character has 10 missions for a total of 360 missions. These missions range from very easy (One simple Hadoken) to a complicated, very precisely timed long sequence of button presses. You can learn a lot as a player from doing these missions, and while these missions aren't exactly as hard as Street Fighter/Super Street Fighter IV's Trials, these missions are not to be taken lightly.Graphics are amazing, sound is amazing. No problems in that area. My only real real real gripe with this game is the lack of two options. First, in player lobbies, something was given to us in street fighter 4 and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 that may have spoiled most of us; Spectator Mode. Now, if I want to practice with friends, I have to wait and do absolutly nothing while my other friends play. Meaning, if I'm in a lobby with 7 other people, and I just lost my game, I now need to wait for 5 more games to complete, while i sit and do nothing. No Minigames, no training mode, and no spectator mode. Seriously? At least something to warm up with, like in Super Smash Bros. for the Wii...but no, instead I can watch the life bars deplete. Seriously bad move. While there are rumors that this may appear in the future in a patch, it's not there at launch. Another small feature that's also absent is setting infinite time in Player lobbies. Another feature that's ridiculously absent.Overall a great game, and with several patches, this could be the best in the series.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Could be the best one in the series...Just needs a patch or two.", "unixReviewTime": 1298160000, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2011"}

They've changed the formula quite a bit, to the point that it kind of loses whatever it was that made MvC2 such a classic among fighting game fans. But is that such a bad thing? It may seem so at first but believe it or not, the game is actually pretty good once you sink your teeth into it.The graphic presentation obviously makes up the biggest difference here from MvC2. The game uses the MT Framework engine used in Resident Evil 5 and no matter what you may or may not think about that game in particular, there's no denying that it had spectacular graphics. Same goes here with the characters being rendered in full 3D models that fight on a 2D plane, very much like Street Fighter 4 did. This allows for some pretty spectacular specials and a veritable light show taking place in just about every match. Some may cry foul that they've moved away from hand drawn sprites but as long as the game isn't trying to play on a 3D plane, then we're good as far as I'm concerned.The character roster takes a hit and I was pretty sad to see a lot of my favorites get left out. You're bound to find characters you will enjoy playing with and some surprising additions. I thought M.O.D.O.K. was actually an inspired inclusion, even if his character controls horribly. It does suck that we've lost something like twenty characters, give or take but if there's one thing I can freely say, it's that the game actually feels a lot more balanced than MvC2 does. MvC2 was capable of some truly one sided mismatches on many occasions and it doesn't really feel like that's a problem here. Granted, there is some cheapness with some of these characters moves and tactics but overall, they did a really good job of making sure the game is more or less balanced.The gameplay has been dumbed down a bit, with the controls being relegated to three attack buttons and the addition of a \"special\" button that serves as the pop-up initiator, whereas before you had to press down and hit them with a fierce attack to setup the air combo. I liked how it was initially because it felt like you had to work to pull it off. A properly executed air combo is still a thing of beauty when done right, its just been made a lot simpler to do. It feels like the game in general has been simplified quite a bit to usher in newcomers in the audience but don't let your fears get to you as the game is still quite deep. Calling in your teammates has been made simpler too and once you get used to it and how they work in terms of pulling off team specials, it becomes second nature. There are a few general additions to the gameplay that make getting ridiculous combos a lot more fun, like three tiered air combos where all the characters on your team can get involved. You also get a license card that allows you to look at your stats as well as anyone else playing over Xbox Live. Very nice touch there. In the end, yeah they've changed the gameplay but if you can get past that, you'll enjoy the game very much.It took me a bit to warm up to it but I think this game has a lot more going for it than people might suspect upon first playing it. I know some of you are upset that Guile was cut or that the graphics are all \"3Dish\". I say, just let the past go. You can still go back and play MvC2 whenever you want. I would definitely suggest getting your hands on this because its a hell of a lot of fun and still a blast to play with your friends and enemies.Last but not least, the music is INFINITELY better than MvC2's.

{"reviewerID": "A3AAK33K3BUUTM", "asin": "B003IE9V28", "reviewerName": "trashcanman", "helpful": [1, 4], "reviewText": "Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is a fan-favorite offshoot of the long-running Street Fighter series that branched out with the well-received X-Men vs. Street Fighter back in the competitive glory days of the 2D fighter.  Over the series' evolution the character rosters would eventually expand over time to include all Marvel comics heroes and villains as well as Capcom's entire legacy of classic video game characters.  The result was, of course, insanity.  MvC is one of the flagship competitive fighting series known for it's complex game mechanics that reward player creativity, extremely hectic action, and deluges of winking fan service towards comic geeks and gamers alike.  It's been a decade since the last MvC title, but with Street Fighter 4 having brought 2D fighters back into the spotlight, the time has never been better to revisit the eternal question once again: could Ryu whup Spider-Man?So how does this crossover extravaganza match up against previous titles in the series?  Very, very well.  While a lot of fans are decrying the relatively smaller 36 playable character roster (down from a mind-shattering 56 in MvC2), the fact is that it's better this way.  The old MvC games pretty much cut-and-pasted the characters from the slew of other versus games out there and threw everyone in the mix which led to mismatched and useless characters.  Competitive play pretty much boiled down to a handful of characters that were clearly much better than the rest.  MvC3 may have trimmed the roster, but it is a phenomenally fun, deep, and balanced roster with each character being useful in their own way and full of nuance.  Both companies also have a lot of new faces representing them, with some of the more obscure characters being surprisingly interesting.  Plus, they all look marvelous.  Even with the fan complaints this is probably the best thing about MvC3.  Yes, in high-level play, there are certain characters that are overpowered, but that list is small and most of us playing this game to have fun and not to win at all costs as a pathetic attempt to boost misguided egos (which probably shouldn't be built around being \"good\" at video games) are not going to spam Sentinel beams (\"neutralizeneutralizeneutralize\"...ugh) and Dark Phoenix every match.  That would just be pathetic.  So yeah, MvC3 features one of the coolest and most balanced rosters in a 2D fighter that I`ve ever played and after a few of weeks of play, I have yet to find my favorite character and have settled mainly into a 9 character rotation.  This is the highest praise.As before, this MvC title features single 3-on-3 tag matches instead of the classic 1-on-1/best-of-3 format favored by most fighting games.  This is really what sets the series apart from other hardcore 2D fighters.  While you can only control 1 character at a time, you are able to change at will and to call in \"assists\" from your offscreen characters to supplement your offensive and defensive endeavors.  For example, if you are trapped in the corner by Wolverine while using a character with poor melee capabilities like Arthur (of Ghosts and Goblins fame), you can call in Haggar (from Final Fight) to come out swinging and knock Wolvie back so you have room to breathe.  This feature adds exponentially to the strategy and complexity of the game and makes forming an effective team combination both vital and fun with so many possibilities.  This brings me to the point that needs to be hammered home the most since I am about to drop some complaints: this gameplay is AMAZING.  It's fun, fast-paced (I have been sweating in the dead of winter), complex, yet very easy to pick up and play assuming you understand the basics of fighting games. The controls have also been streamlined for console play, much to the chagrin of those who spend way too much money on specialized arcade-style stick setups.  While beginners may want to polish their skills in training and arcade modes before tackling veterans online, they shouldn't be too overwhelmed.  This is the definition of easy to learn, difficult to master.  There is also a \"simple mode\" to the controls to level the playing field between friends with skill discrepancies in multiplayer  that allows some more complex moves to be pulled off with the push of a button at the expense of variety.  It's an alright idea, I guess, but it's not for me.  Mission Mode allows for players to challenge themselves to duplicate combos dictated by the game, which is a cool challenge, but the fact that some of the combos are so long the commands can't even fit onscreen makes it feel like you are practicing for a piano recital and not playing a game.  Not fun, but a good way for beginners to learn the art of comboing, nevertheless.Okay, folks, it's whiny time.  While I have nothing but praise for the gameplay and graphics, I have to take MvC3 to task for a stunning lack of features.  First off, as I write this there is no lobby spectator mode in multiplayer.  That is to say that when you join an online lobby, you don't get to watch the other players' matches while you wait your turn.  You pretty much get to sit and stare at a loading screen.  That is not why I play these games, and it`s unacceptable.  The fun and learning experience of watching and commentating on ongoing fights is a huge part of any fighting community and while Capcom has claimed they will patch this in later, I cannot think of a good reason to not have it there in the first place.  This STANDARD.  Frankly, I'm tempted to drop a full star off of the rating, but assuming they make good on the promise of a patch, I'll hold off on that.  Now, in one of Deadpool's 4th wall-breaking antics (a staple of the character in the comics) he occasionally addresses the player personally at the end of the match during his victory rant with \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WEREN'T RECORDING THAT?!\".  Good question, Wade.  Why couldn't we record that?  It's becoming pretty handy to post videos and study recordings of matches to show off to friends and learn different gameplay techniques.  Again, this should be standard.  In addition to the massive multiplayer gripes, the single player lacks a lot to see and do.  No in-game cut scenes aside from the canned match openings really hurts the production value of the arcade mode.  The endings are cool and all and usually filled with crazy crossover goodness featuring characters that we wish had made the roster but didn't, but the static comic images pale in comparison to the fully animated and voiced finales and story sections of games like Dead or Alive 4.  It's ridiculously easy to unlock the very few characters that aren't immediately available and the other unlockables are mostly things like art and character profiles.  Not super-rewarding, but better than nothing, I suppose.  Worst of all, word has it that a lot of the alternate costumes (and possibly even full characters) are already present on the disc, but are being sold as DLC.  This is not good, Capcom.  Making us pay to unlock something on the disc we already paid for is no way to do business and I WILL NOT DO IT.  The price for upcoming downloadable characters is about $5 apiece. A bit steep, if you ask me.  Also, your non-ranked online stats aren't displayed and are lumped with Arcade Mode victories instead.  Not cool.  This should have been an all-time great fighter, but as it stands, it feels half-@$zed and unfinished in a lot of areas and having Capcom charge us for things like alternate costumes after leaving so much out of the game does not help.So in conclusion, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is a deliriously entertaining fighting game.  It's full of surprises, little obscure touches for fans, funny verbal interplay between characters, and most of all good times.  You really can't beat it for awesome gameplay.  However, I'm going a bit easy on the rating in anticipation of the patch for spectator mode and I need to point out that companies need to stop putting out unfinished games and then charging us for extra content.  It feels like Capcom held back features from this game intentionally (possibly anticipating a \"Super\" edition in a year or so?) and that stops this from getting a perfect score.  However, since the game itself is so damn fun I've still got to give it very high marks since that`s always the final word with me.  Comprehensive features or not, this is still an awesome game and I'm having a ball with it online and off.4  stars rounded up because I can't stay mad at you, Capcom.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Happiness is a 3 character aerial combo with a hyper finisher.", "unixReviewTime": 1298937600, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2011"}

You and your opponent each have a team of three characters to battle it out in one frantic, continuous round accented by dazzling finishing moves and triple-digit combos. But beneath all its style, the game's core combat mechanics have been simplified and work harmoniously to drive you, and the action, forward. Locomotion plays a large role in this, even if the characters are slower than before. This change feels natural in the game's large arenas and affords you the time to plan out your next move without having to rely on blindly overwhelming your opponent. But even if you are slower, you never want to stop moving. There is safety in mobility when every character can clear the length of the arena in a single bound or pepper you with projectiles from a screen away. Stopping only makes things easier for your opponent.Movement keeps the battle flowing and changing as you duck in and out of your opponent's reach, each side frantically searching for that break in the other's defenses. Sometimes opportunity is easy to spot. Other times you have to make your own luck. In either case, when it's time to strike, the number of tools you have in your arsenal is intoxicating. You might unleash a fierce flurry of blows, summon another character to take a quick shot, or employ a snap back attack for a more favorable match-up. When on the defense, a well-timed advancing guard can punish a nasty rushdown player, while a crossover counter can rescue a teammate under fire.

Well, it's not like the game's been in development for that long, but I can kind of see why a lot of people are ending up disappointed with it. The lack of gameplay modes, the high price for downloadable characters, a lot of the characters here more or less being ones that no one really wanted, etc. Granted, I'm not in the same boat as those people, but Marvel vs Capcom 3 just doesn't deliver all the goods in my eyes, and I was hoping Capcom would've really given it their all considering how beloved the last game was, and how it's still frequently played in big tournaments like EVO. The bottom line is that if you're a hardcore fighting game fan, as in the kind of person who counts frames, knows the right links in combos, knows exactly how much damage x attack does to x character, and even the right spacing for moves, you're probably going to eat this up. Casual fighting game fans, stay away from this game if you have any plans of playing online.I'll start with the things I liked about MvC3. First up, I actually liked most of the cast here. In Marvel vs Capcom 2, you had a very diverse cast, with characters from popular and obscure games. The thing is, at least half of those characters rarely got used, because it was made very clear when you played with all of them, that characters like Amingo and Roll wouldn't last 10 seconds against a Magneto or Sentinel. But the cast was still there, and a lot of people were happy with who they had. In MvC3, it seems like Capcom took time in putting equal time into the characters, making things a lot more balanced than in the last game. And I really love how some less popular/known characters are here instead of the standard guys, like how we have Amaterasu from Okami and Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins. I had a lot of fun seeing each character's different moves and animations. The music is also MUCH better than MvC2's, as we no longer have rejected Charlie Brown tracks. Instead, every character has their own theme, and once a character is taken out, the new character who steps in has their theme playing. And for people who like getting trophies, there are a lot of pretty easy ones to get. I got nearly 40% after playing for just 2 hours. The endings for each character were also a great touch- your ending in arcade mode depends on who your main character is when you beat the final boss, and some of these things are pretty funny. 'a lot better than those in either version of Street Fighter IV.Now the not so good, which is the rest of the game/the important parts- the gameplay. If you've played Tatsunoko vs Capcom on the Wii, the controls here are very similar to that. So if you've only played Street Fighter IV over the last 2 years, this is going to be pretty different for you. You have light, medium and heavy attacks, a special launcher attack for air combos, and the other buttons are used for calling in your team mates for assists. It's not that hard to get the hang of, but here's the thing- Capcom included a Simple play mode, where square is all of your attacks, triangle is your special moves, x is still the launcher, and circle is your hyper combo attack. This is for very casual players who button mash, or don't want to spend time learning moves. This carries over to online mode, where you could face someone using these controls, and spams special moves over and over again, causing a ton of frustration. It'll get pretty annoying fast too, since the couple of times I've went online, at various times of the day, matchmaking was 50/50, and it'd take forever to get a match, even when there were tons of people available and I had a good connection. 'reminded me of the Guilty Gear X2 #Reload days...But the key problem for me is that I just plain got bored with how flashy everything was, though that might be because this just isn't my kind of game I guess. I love fighting games- 'started out with the first Street Fighter II on the SNES, moved on to the King of Fighters and Fatal Fury games, Samurai Shodown, Capcom vs SNK, Last Blade, Street Fighter III, Guilty Gear, etc. I think it's because I'm more keen on traditional 2D fighters that don't involve tagging in your partners every couple of seconds to win. But that's just me.However, the thing that ruins a lot of the fun for me is the X Factor. This is a special move you can use once per fight at any time. If you use it when all 3 of your characters are active, it gives you a small boost in power for a few seconds, and recovery on the red part of your bar is healed a little faster. If you use it when 2 members of your team are present, it gives you more power and faster healing. But if you use it with your final character, they can be a complete monster. Some characters that will completely obliterate entire teams while in X Factor mode are Hulk, Sentinel, Zero and Dante. If you're facing one of these guys with a fragile character like Phoenix, who already goes down in about 8 hits (to balance out her strong attacks), kiss your lil' lady goodbye after 2 hits. I'm really hoping a patch comes out that cuts down the boosts a bit sometime in the next couple of months, but it doesn't seem likely. And while I said the roster is pretty balanced, some characters are still a little overpowered, or too newbie friendly to the point where you can zone your opponents pretty easily with a few moves. But advanced players will know how to get around this of course.Visually, the game looks pretty good, though some character designs are downright weird looking. Chris in particular looks odd during his win pose, and the illustration of the Hulk has tons of people wondering what's wrong with his teeth. Everything has a comic book look to it, and a lot of the Capcom guys translated well to this style, even if they haven't been in a major console game for years. But gameplay is generally smooth and there's rarely any slowdown, online and offline.Like I said, there's a lot here for people who obsess over fighting games, but if you're interested in playing because of the characters or hype, you might just want to rent it for a day and see how it goes. Marvel vs Capcom 3 is vastly different from the likes of Super Street Fighter IV, a game I keep bringing up because up until now, it was -the- fighting game to play on consoles (BlazBlue being a close second, but not as well known). Casual fighting game players will be annihilated online, so if you do get this but don't plan on getting an arcade fight stick or being that serious, it'd be fun for parties or something with relatives who don't play many games. Just don't say I didn't warn you, especially when a single Sentinel wipes out your party while X Factor is active.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Well, the hardcore fighting game players will at least love it.", "unixReviewTime": 1298764800, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2011"}

From Street Fighter to Tekken to Mortal Kombat I pretty much love them all.  The strategy involved within them is usually a quick mind game, which I enjoy.  Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 doesn't dissapoint.  The overall playstyle is very easy to pick up, but can be difficult to master depending on which characters you chose.  Alot of people ask which fighting game would you compare it to?  Obviously that would be street fighter, as far as the inputs go, however, it is not as technical and way more easier to pick up.  I'll list a few pros and cons about this game.+Presentation:  I actually love the comic book feel to the game.  The game is not meant to have realistic graphics or anything.  It works very well for what it is.  The Hyper and super combos are flashy and that's what makes the game.  It makes you go \"oo and aah\"+Gameplay: I actually like that pretty much every character has the same setup of Low, Medium, High then Launch button.  It makes it pretty simple to play with a vast amount of characters.  Even though that this scheme is \"standard\" there is still multiple ways to attack your opponent before launching them in the air for an air combo.  You don't have to rely on this button scheme all of the time.  Also, it doesn't work for every character.  Dormmamu for example, you can't connent a low, medium, high into a launch.  You have connect Low, Medium and then Launch.  His High won't connect.+Sounds and Voices: I love all of the English Voices except for Ryu. I have him set to Japenese, but the rest of them are pretty Epic, and some of them are quite Hilarious such as Deadpool and Hulk.  I love how you go into a fight and the voices seem so personalized for what's actually going on.  For example, when Deadpool goes into a match when he is fighting a street fighter character (Akuma, C. Viper, Chun Li, Ryu) he will say \"I Freaking Love Street Fighter, Will you Sign my spleen for me?\"  It's pretty funny and entertaining.Now for some Cons of the game:-Unlockables: There is not very much going on here.  The unlockable characters can easily be unlocked in about 20 minutes of gameplay.  It isn't that hard.  I believe as soon as you hit 8,000PP everyone is unlocked.  After that, all you have is player endings and models.  Which are not all that exciting to say the least.-Online play: This is by far the worst thing about the game.  The online play is HORRIBLE!!!  First of all, I can never find a match.  I will literally search for about 10 minutes before I can find one, and when I do it's a laggy spam fest.  All players do online is chose Zoner characters mainly Sentinal, Trish, Dormmamu, Dr. Doom, Arthur or Iron Man, and they spam beams all day long.  I am actually not complaining about this, because spamming is a viable tactic in a fighting game.  If you can't beat spammers that is your fault.  Anywho, my main complaint is the lag involved, everytime I try to get to them, I usually can't.  I am a close range fighter my Team consist of Akuma, Chun Li and Wolverine.  The only far range fighter I have is Akuma.  So it can sometimes be tough for me to get in.  Also, I have a problem with the ranking system.  I am not too sure how when I started a rank match as a beginner I got paired with a 6th lord.  That made no sense to me at all.-Sentinal:  He's over powered.  I hate him, I hated him in MVC2 and I hate him now.  I don't care what anyone says.  He's chaep.  Hands down.  May I ask why Capcom decided to give the biggest character in the game the most stamina, mega damage output, and a full screen beam move that you can do by just pressing one button?  It makes no sense at all.  To top it all off, his launch has armor properties, which means that you pretty much have to hit him twice or more if he is trying to launch you in the air for an air combo.  It's ridiculous.  Not to mention his Sentinal Force Bomb assist.  It's ridiculous.  You can't advance at all when it's coming at you.  It takes up the entire screen you have to block it.  I could go on and on all day about Sentinel.  He needs to be nerfed big time.-Unbalanced:  Every fighting game can't be perfectly balanced.  MVC3 is not as unbalanced as MVC2, but it has it's moments.  Close range characters (Hulk, Hagger) have high stamina and high damage output which is how it's supposed to be, but what about other close range characters such as Chun Li, and Wolverine.  Their damage is not very good at all, especially Chun Li.  It just seems like Close ranged righters in this game recieve the end of the stick most of the time.-X Factor: Stupid just stupid.  Sentinel in X factor = Death Sentance.  I hate it.  I hate how I can defeat two characters on one team, and then my opponent can take out my entire squad by just going into X factor and either spamming long range attacks or just keep doing super moves.  Also not to mention the least amount of characters you have the longer X Factor stays activated and the higher the damage output.  Do you want to know why so many people pick Sentinel as their third character and then X Factor?  Yea, that's why.  Highest Damage output in the game goes even Higher, and it lasts longer.  It's so ridiculous.Overall MVC3 is just an okay game.  It's fun, when you are playing with someone who is actually skilled and likes to do combos.  Otherwise it can become really frustrating and old very quick.  Do I regret my purchase?  Eh, not at the moment.  But I have a feeling that I will once everyone figures out that you pretty much have to be to an a**hole to even win a match anymore.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "I love the game, I hate the players", "unixReviewTime": 1298678400, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2011"}

Nolan North reprises his role and Dp's line are as random and funny as ever. (I especially like the moonwalking) However, this game is all about Deadpool (even if it I wish it was) so I'll get on with the rest of the game.I'll be quite honest, I bought the game for the fact that it's a Marvel game, not because it's Capcom. I don't really care about most of Capcom's roster, the only one I usually play as is Dante. The Marvel side of the roster though, I frequently fight as good amount of them. By now it should be obvious that I play as Deadpool for the majority of my playtime. I also enjoy his fellow weapon x subjects; Wolverine and X-23. Taskmaster is also pretty dope with his cast arsenal of replicated weaponry. Sentinal's massive bulk is fun to use, but looks kind of awkward when towering over smaller characters like Amaterasu or Viewtiful J. Ironman is as aswesome as always; the photon canon is rediculously fun. I think that about wraps it for my favored characters.Gameplay is fun, but I'm not quite used to it yet. I've noticed that people seem to complain a lot about the flashing and such. I honestly didn't mind it. I was slightly disapointed with the arcade mode, it felt too short, but the endings kind'a made up for it. The training mode is fun, it gives more enemy AI option, so instead of only kicking the snot out of and enemy that won't fight back, you can choose to adjust the options so you actually have a chalenge. I've yet to play online, which I doubt is a big deal considering I'd most likely get pwned by far superior fighters. I also like the galery quite a bit. Feels like a lot more extras than what comrable games like Mortal Kombat, or Soul Calibur have.Overall I've really enjoyed the game and I would recomend it to fans of super hero games or even fighting games (despite the fact that some claim it's not the best).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Engrossing", "unixReviewTime": 1298678400, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2011"}

But since this is a review I have to say more.  MvC series goes back a long time to PS1 and I loved those games, so my expectations were very high for this game.  And this game is absolutely wicked, first of all I have to talk about the game has the same tag team feature like the past games so no worries on that.  This time the fighters are 3D which really set them out from the stage and environment , the gameplay is slower than the ones of the past and you have 3 attack buttons like Tatsunoko vs. Capcom if you have a Wii.  When playing this game the fighters and their moves are so fluid and precise, I can imagine if these people were real that's how they'd do it because they look so good doing it.  Now for the fighters there's 36 of them plus 2 if you got DLC for preordering so the list is shorter than MvC2, the list is awesome some fighters made it that I didn't think would like: Taskmaster, Super-Skrull, Albert Wesker and Chris Redfield from Resident Evil and I can't forget one of my favorites X-23 she's better than Wolverine and they dropped fighters such as Venom, Captain Commando and Gambit but it's hard to focus on the negative.  Of course you got your usual fighters like Ryu, Hulk, Captain America and Chun li.  The combos are incredible the whole linking, juggling, tagging in and out and the versatility of the combos are spectacular. Then the Hyper Combos how they have improved are really great even linking them are cool and how some of them make good counters and anti-air attacks like Iron Man cannon now can be angled for a jumper as well as Ryu's hadokens.  I can't spoil it for you because I can talk about this game for hours. You know Capcom is truly on a hot streak with fighting games they hit hard with SF4 then SSF4  and of course Tatsunoko vs. Capcom on wii all of these were perfect.  So for my review:  GAMEPLAY 5stars this feels/handle better than previous MvCs and the combos are better too , GRAPHICS 5stars this game is 3D and looks beautiful, FIGHTERS 5stars they improved on an already great roster, ONLINE 5stars some minor drops here and there but what multiplayer doesn't have that.

{"reviewerID": "A3IH2VJC8QR2DQ", "asin": "B003IEBO9Q", "reviewerName": "Call me Monty...", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was definitely the most anticipated fighter this year; consequently, the expectations were through the roof. Normally when this happens, disappointment is bound to happen due to the unrealistic expectations. Luckily, I'm a reasonable person so my expectations weren't crazy..But unfortunately, this game falls pretty short regardless.First things first - the graphics are outstanding.  The characters are 2D, but are shaded in such a way that they appear 3D. The stages are beautifully made with tons of detail (such as Chun-Li being painted on the side of a building on the Daily Bugle stage, and the glass in the Resident Evil stage being broken when there's a heavy slam on the ground). The Main Menu screens contain beautifully done artwork and are nice to look at. The end match screens, which are made in the form of a comic book, are well put-together as well. Voice Acting is another plus. There's even some personal conversations between characters at the beginning and end of a match. A neat little touch.The gameplay is great. The roster is MUCH more balanced than the broken atrocity that was Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Capcom tried to make the game more accessible to newcomers and casual fighting fans, and it shows. One example is the \"simple mode.\" When I first started to play fighting games, I was clueless on what the motions meant--Z-motions to do uppercuts were basically like quantum physics to me. While I can do it flawlessly now, there are many newcomers to this genre who are just like I was. Thus, Capcom added \"simple\" mode which allows people to do combos, special moves, and hyper combos by the simple touch of a button. This doesn't give an unfair advantage, though, since you'll only have access to about half of your moveset. The only way to get better is to practice, practice, practice. The purpose of simple mode is, if you don't have the time to practice consistently, you can still play and join the fun as you practice in secret when you can.One reason people tend to give this game low ratings is due to the lack of modes. Lack of story mode, survival mode, time attack mode, etc. for instance are pretty much a standard part of most fighters nowadays. This game lacks all of the mentioned modes. In fact, all there is to do is Arcade mode, Mission mode (do the indicated combos), Training Mode, and Vs. Mode against human only (no VS. CPU), and Online mode, which we will discuss later. This means that there isn't too much to do. Me personally, I'm not holding this against the game since I don't really care too much for stories in fighting games, or survival mode/time attack mode, etc. Training Mode does what it's supposed to, and Arcade is just your standard Arcade mode. Still, for a game that was marketed towards casual players, the lack of features was surprising.The online is what destroys the game. Unless you have a LOT of friends to play with in person all the time, online mode is where one spends (or should be spending, at least) the majority of their time, due to the multiplayer nature of this game. One problem I, as well as many people, seem to have is the fact that connecting to matches takes tediously long.Another severe blow to the online mode is due to the lack of a Spectator feature. When you are in a lobby with more than 2 people (such as playing with friends), rather than being able to watch the match between two other people you just sit at the menu. You see the health bars of the 2 participants, but who honestly wants to look at that? This wouldn't have been a big deal if it wasn't something that ALL OTHER fighting games had (Super Street Fighter IV, Tekken 6, even Marvel vs. Capcom 2). If it is a 3 player lobby, this can be tolerable; if there are 5 people in a lobby however, this means 15+ minutes of staring at the menu before you can play. Who wants to do that??The nail in the coffin for this game, however, is the netcode (which is what the online is based on). The netcode was poorly made. The game contains a button lag implement while online, where if you press a button, there is a brief delay between your press and the attack actually occuring (unlike offline mode, where the attack comes out instantaneously). It is also inconsistent, since this lag varies between matches. This means all the time you spend in training mode, and all the fancy combos you do on your friends in real life are difficult to impossible whilst online due to the delay.  Even blocking is tricky to do because of the delay, which means you will probably still be getting hit when you started blocking well before. As a result, most people online tend to do the same exact combos over and over with not much variety, and this tends to get boring to endure. I am not one to complain about spamming/etc, but when the game isn't doing something what I'm telling it to do, something is wrong. On top of the button lag is regular lag. From what I've seen, you can be playing against someone across the street from you and the game will still randomly slow down and turn choppy. The match will run smoothly one second and all of a sudden there will be pauses in between frames. The training mode has a lag feature where you can practice under certain lag conditions, but it is completely different from the actual lag you encounter online. It is essentially a waste of time. Capcom can do much better than this, as demonstrated by their previous fighter, Super Street Fighter IV, which had FANTASTIC online play.That being said...Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is still a decent game. It's a bare-bones game, but if you're a huge fan of the series then you'll love it regardless. If you're a casual fighter, look for a friend who has it and try it out before purchase.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good game, but online needs MAJOR work", "unixReviewTime": 1303084800, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2011"}

You will have your choice of 3 characters to go up against another team of 3 characters. If you can master the moves, as well as master when to bring a different character in, you could find yourself a champion. Now as with most fighting games, there's not a whole lot to the story portion of the game. Yes, Galactus is trying to consume your world, and you're going to need to defeat all the fighters between you and him, but other than that, its basically knock out your opponent with skill.Graphically this game looks great. In my opinion there will never be anything wrong with a 2D fighting game. You're also going to have quite a few of very intense attacks that run smoothly when executed. I have to give it to them, there isn't much, if any, jittery motions or graphical issues when trying to do so much on the screen. The backgrounds will give you a sense of nostalgia for the most part. I personally really like the Ghost 'n Goblins board.The music is your standard affair fighting music. Sure there's some special flair for the characters and franchises represented, but you're probably not going to be paying any attention to it as you're going to be solely focused on your opponent.The controls for this game will basically have you utilizing every button minus the select button. You'll notice that buttons for different characters will do different things, as well as combinations of buttons. The thing about fighting games is that there's always going to be different combinations of buttons to create some very devastating attacks, and if you can master those, which I have to say most of them aren't too difficult to get down, you're going to have quite a bit of fun with this game.So as stated above this is a fighting game where you get to choose from several members from the Marvel Universe as well as the Capcom universe. Sure there were a ton of characters that I'm sure people wanted to see in the mix, but overall I think they did a pretty good job capturing some of the favorite characters from respected franchises. My personal favorite combo was Arthur (Ghost 'n Goblins), X-23 (Xmen), and Trish (Devil May Cry). Sure they aren't the heavy hitters of the bunch, but man can they deal out some punishment when you get their moves down. Personally I'm a button masher so I know that online competition is a bit out of my range, but facing off against friends is a lot of fun, and if you liking fighting games, and have a competitive streak, you'll find you've played more matches than you intended to. Take Jesse and I for example, we ended up playing 30+ matches, sadly we split them down the middle, so I couldn't show my awesome supremacy, but it was enjoyable every time.So if you're looking for a solid fighting game that gives you more than kicks and punches, and has a cast of characters from different Capcom games as well as characters from the Marvel Universe, then this is the game you've got to try. I may not be the biggest fighting game person, but I have to say that I highly enjoyed this game, and also the fact is that if you button mash there's a good chance that you'll last a bit through a match/game.

Capcom 3The new heroes are here to kick butt and take names, and after a decade of wondering if this game would ever come into being, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is finally here. If you've never played the series before, let me just inform you this is not your typical fighting game. This is more of an action fighting game, in the sense that the first few matches are going to be chaotic looking. There's characters popping in and out of the screen. There's combos popping up all over the screen. Before you know it, you're dead without even getting a hit in. But with much practice comes great benefits.Your first choices in the game will be to take it offline in arcade mode or training, or take a chance in online battles via ranked or player matches. Offline modes are limited to arcade, training, versus, and a mission mode. Arcade is just the basic story mode. You'll pick three characters to battle, all with different abilities to battle round after round until you defeat a special boss. When you beat the final boss, you'll unlock a comic strip ending for the character that you were last using. You'll also unlock some badges and titles for your win to show off online. If you're having a difficult time learning moves, training mode is there to help. However, mission mode is going to be more helpful in teaching you how to successfully complete moves. Mission mode is more reminiscent of the challenge modes in Super Street Fighter IV. You have a training dummy in front of you, and you're mission is to provide a certain attack to it.Online modes are limited to ranked and player matches. I don't really find this to be a bad thing, but it's apparent some people wanted more modes. You can party up online much like a \"quarter mode\", which is great, and it's also the downfall of online play. While you're the observer, you never get to watch the battle. You're treated to two player cards of the fighters with the health bars moving up and down during their match. But you'll never get to see the moves they're pulling off, making tournaments seem almost pointless. There's also no replay feature, so watching some of the cool moves you distributed to a player is long gone. Hopefully Capcom will reintroduce this in a patch in the future, without a DLC cost.Everything in a match is fast moving and player momentum is natural in a game like this. You want to keep moving, providing damage, and repeat. In Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and while the animations have been slowed down they compliment the game atmosphere nicely.One way Marvel vs. Capcom designers have tried to help remove the anxiety new gamers feel during their first match is by introducing a new mode: Simple mode, or button mashing mode if you prefer. It gives high hopes for beginners to be able to win a match. With this mode enabled, you literally can just press the same button over and over while moving the stick around to pull off sweet moves. By using simple mode, even the most novice player may have a chance at winning. While simple mode may be good for grandmas and tottlers, it is going to limit the amount of special moves a player can use. It enables easy access to simpler moves, and that's it. Now, this doesn't mean that in simple mode, you're not going to need any skill at all. You'll probably want to focus on blocks to get you ready for the real fighting of the game: the online modes.Another huge change is the inclusion of X-Factor. This mode enables to you increase your attack power and speed for a limited time, depending on how many characters are still alive in your party. It also resets your animation, giving you access to chain more moves together that would be impossible otherwise. It sounds like a gimmick move, but in the game, it's been quit helpful and I haven't experienced it being overused.Graphically, this game is well done too. The game feels much like a comic book opening up in front of you. The dark shadows look amazing, and can't simple be justified to how amazing they look in screen shots. The animations are smooth, and you'll rarely see a hick-up in the game. The backgrounds are slightly muted to bring the characters forward a little bit. It almost looks like you're playing a 2D fighting game at times, which isn't a bad thing. They just mastered how well to do the visuals in a sense that it looks old school, yet 3D at the same time.Let's talk roster for a minute. There's 36 characters to choose from, half from Marvel Comics, and the others from Capcom games. This is a lot less than the roster of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, but is that a bad thing? Marvel vs. Capcom 2, while a terrific fighting game, had some huge holes in the balancing because of so many characters. Most of the time, the balancing wasn't from over-powered fighters as much as under powered characters. So Capcom decided to keep the roster a little smaller while fine-tuning each character with pros and cons. This is obviously a good thing, but coming from Capcom, this might have been a way to milk a little more money out of the game. We can expect some DLC to come out shortly after (March has two new characters and a costume pack scheduled for release). What worries me is how much this stuff is going to cost. Capcom knows people will buy it up, so are they going to charge the extra mile because they know this?However, even though I'm not a fan of overpriced DLC, Capcom is at least listening to the fans on the DLC they want. On Capcom Utility's website, you can actually vote for characters you want to see in the game (hint: Gambit needs to come back, so vote!). I find this to be really neat and I hope they truly listen to their fans. If anything needs DLC fast in the game, I feel they need to add some more maps. The maps are awesome that are already in the game, but there's hardly any to really look at. I wouldn't even mind some recycled maps from the previous installments of the game.The only other complaint I have is the controls on a standard controller. They work, but they never feel comfortable. The game begs for a fight stick of some sort. I haven't played on the Xbox 360's D-pad yet, but I can imagine it being atrocious given that the 360's D-pad isn't exactly the most impressive on the market.If anything, the game is going to hold it's own for a while but it will probably not be in the ranks of classic like it's predecessor. It's all a matter of time to how well this game will rank in the end. With DLC coming out, one can hope that Capcom listens to their fans and keeps the community strong.+ Great character list with balance issues in check+ Outstanding graphics and sounds.- Being nerfed online by Iron Man.

The new characters, the new graphics and a long awaited sequel of Marvel vs. Capcom 2. It was on my list of games to get and while I couldn't get it on initial release, I was foolish to sell my Okami game (that I won at a Smash Brothers tournament) to get enough money to buy this game...and what pissed me off was when I got the game, Crapcom decided to release an updated version 6 months after this game was released meaning when I bought the game THEY ANNOUNCED THEY WERE REMAKING IT. You don't know how angry I was with the announcement especially when Ultimate would have Phoenix Wright and Vergil (probably the only two new characters that I cared about because the Marvel side was crap addiction).But this was probably the game that made me realize that Crapcom has fallen from grace especially when they used the tsunami as an excuse to delay the game and as many people pointed out, Capcom of Japan wasn't even near the tsunami so there was no way they as a company would be affected (but the workers and their families are another thing but we're talking about the company).The worse part was when I got this game, I wouldn't be able to get my money back because this game won't sell for that much with Ultimate that came out and Crapcom basically said \"Unless you buy Ultimate, you're stuck with this junk we're not supporting.\"This is a real shame because I had fun playing this game...but got bored just as easily. The game feels like a beta version with Ultimate being the complete version. The game is not balanced and it feels like the endings at the end of each character chapter was just thrown in at the last minute foreshadowing who would show up in Ultimate. I feel for the Megaman fans who were teased with the poster of Megaman in one of the background stages and then denied access to have him in game to the point that his only \"appearance\" was a palette swap.The worse part was because of Ultimate, there wasn't much you could do with game once you got all the endings and achievements. There weren't that many characters to unlock and there were only two DLC characters (that Crapcom would charge later in Ultimate at the same price instead of putting them in given they were in this one). I really liked playing with Dante, Chun Li and a Morrigan team but when everyone plays broken characters like Magneto or easy to use Wolverine online, there was either no challenge because they were too easy or they would constantly spam online making online play worthless. This game didn't have spectator mode either.So the main reason I'm giving this a 1 is because I feel cheated out of my money and now this game is just sitting in my room never to be played again because it got boring after a month and there's no way to get all my money back. I'll probably try to sell it later for something but it still pisses me off greatly. I give the fun rating a three because I did enjoy playing this game with my friends, but again, this doesn't do much because once they're gone, its back to being bored with it again. If I just waited and bought Ultimate, I probably wouldn't be feeling as agitated as I am now but I won't get Ultimate given I boycotted Crapcom.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Way to Piss On Your Consumers Crapcom", "unixReviewTime": 1363046400, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2013"}

I have alot to say so this may come off as a rambling review, so forgive me if it goes that route. First I'll adress the title of this review. They really did not serve Phoenix well in this game. It is not that she is a bad character, she just is to weak. She looses health faster than any character maybe in the whole history of the versus games. I own all the versus games. I'm not saying that makes me an expert, but damn it is just rediculous. Just for FYI I own that Saturn version of X-Men vs Sf , MSH vs SF and the Dreamcast version of Marvel one so I got the good copies of those games not the watered down PS1 versions. But I digress that is a let down, because I really wanted to roll with that character, I swaped her out for Storm, so that completes my team that I use the most of Dante,X-23 and her. Enough of that, now on to something the public may acutually care about.There is alot of complaining when it comes to this game and I knew it would be that way. This is the kind of game that is going to generate over praise and be overly criticised because it is a popular title. You have the camp that will love this game now matter what after all ITS MAHVEL BABY!!! And in some peoples mind just for that reason alone it can do no wrong. Then there is the camp that will not like because ITS MAHVEL BABY!!!They want to oppose it and act like yeah I heard of that and I played it. It is a overated piece of _____ and I hate it. This is wrong, that is wrong, and what have you. This game is not perfect by any means. You have Tatsunoko vs Capcom that recieved praise from the public and most people said it is a very good game and you should own it if you like fighting games. I have that game is it fun, yes is it perfect no. These two games are alot alike. They have virtualy the same fighting engine with this game being easier to play than that one. Which to me is unbelivable. But this game has Marvel in the front, it is a sequal to arguably the most popular fighting game ever made, so people are inclined not to like it. Now I'm not saying if you don't like this game you are a side line hater with an agenda. But, I know human nature and I know that plays a roll in some peoples minds.If you are comparing this game to MvC2 your already looking to the wrong source to get an understanding of this game. Like I stated before this game plays like Tatsunoko. If the sequal to Marvel 2 was made in 03 it would probably have been alot like that one. But, this is 11 years later and times have changed alot. Hell, I was 21 when the Marvel 2 came out lol. Capcom in a wise business decision made this game easier to play to get more people and more importantly more money. From a business stand point that makes sense, from a gamer stand point you look like a sell out. But, by no means is this game easy. Its like I heard someone say, most of these people talking probably have no mastered anything so they should wait to see what the game holds before they write it off. I have seen some sick combos in this game. That _____ ain't easy to pull off. There is deep gameplay to be found if you look beyond the controls and actually delve into it.Next complaint did the roster is not as large as the last one. Come on people use some common sense. Did you really think it would be? The last game used character sprites dating back to 1994, X-Men Children of the Atom. That is where they got Storm, Cyclopes, and Wolverine sprites came from just to name a few. So they had a back log of characters from that series, the Alpha series and the Vs's games. So the said F it throwem all in here and see what we get. We got an unbalanced mess is what we got. Yet a fun game that is a classic. Yes there where new sprites Jill and Cable come to mind. But on the whole they where just copying and pasting them into that game.I always wish Capcom did redraw those character that would have been really cool to see, oh well that didn't happen. Maybe when its said and done will have a game that has that many characters. But you will have to pay for them. For 5 bucks a pop and you can have all the characters that Capcom makes. Ughh DLC that is whole other story I ain't gettin into today.The most important thing here is the game fun. And that it succeeds in. I'm not a kid anymore. I play games for fun in particular I play fighting games. I have overs 60 so I like that genre and I'm glad to see it make a come back. Down with the FPS!!! I'm kidding. The game is really good looking, online videos do this game no justice. The comic book look and style of this game really pop of the screen. And if you have and HD tv it is eye candy. The game is just eye catching, even if someone you know does not play video games. They will see this and ask what is that game you are playing. The characters are a little to floaty and the tag in and out is slow. Its not a fast as Tatsunoko's and especially Marvel 2. Anyone can play and enjoy it. Look I'm not with dumbing down games. Games now a days are way to easy on a whole. This game does not need a simple mode. How slow do you have to be to not be able to handle a L/M/H attack button? The game is what it is have fun with it, try not to look at what it is not and appreciate what it is. I gave this game 5 stars and it is not a 5 star game it more like 4 1/2. But and I say this every time I want to give a game half grade. Amazon does not have half scores so I gave it five, to boost its score because this game desereves a higher score than 3 1/2 stars. So people plug in your HRAP, Madcatz TE stick or even a PS3 controller and be taken for a ride, did you think I wouldn't say that atleast once. Life is far to short to be complaining about video games. Enjoy the game for what it is and put the BS to the side, because this is Marvel vs Capcom 3 sit back and enjoy the show.

Sentinel has a larger hit box, but conversely - he has more reach. Phoenix technically has TWO lives. MODOK can lay traps on the field. Haggar's Pipe attack hits like an Ultra.

Blazeblue, Darkstalkers and of course the SF series and all of the variaties attached to them. But after being a lifelong gamer, I quit playing fighters. Games evolved, sports and racing games became more realistic and this generation's arcades live long and prosper under the names of Battlefield and Call of Duty. And having friends over for a party game is no longer limited to fighters and sports, but singing, mini-games, etc.MvC3 does some things great. For my money's worth, this is not only the best looking fighter ever, but one of my favorite games ever from a graphics standpoint. The characters have to be seen in motion with the insane speed and fireworks exploding at all times. For some it could be overwhelming, not for me.  Visually stunning is an understatement.The controls. This is a bit of an issue. Because the game moves so fast and Capcom loostened up the controls (allowing sloppy input to still generate the desired move) the game very quickly can devolve into a button masher. It is too easy to accidentaly trigger your mega-ginormous-screen filling-finsiher when your simply trying to swap characters. After carefully building your \"Maxx\" gauge for that end of match push only to burn two levels while your trying to swap teamates is very frustrating. My 8yr old loves it. Talk about pick up and play. Anyone, including a 3rd grader, can take a quick peak and the moves list and light the screen on fire. For casual gamers, that's terrific. For a hardcore fighting fanatic, that it is heresy.I gave the game 5 stars for fun because it really is. But 3 stars overall for lack of depth and replayability - hence the title.

Marvel and Capcom battling each other and together to save the world once again.  Even though it took more than 10 years to make, the wait was well worth it!!Controls:This is where everyone will have a lot of gripe with.  If you played Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom, you'll see that it's similar to this game, but with the difference of the 4th button.  Now, MVC2 had Weak/Medium and Strong attacks that made it simple, but insanely difficult to pull off combos in the game.  In MVC3, it's totally different.  There are 4 buttons here.  Weak Attack, Medium Attack, and Strong Attack are your three basic attacks in the game.  The last one is called the \"Special\" button where this button launches the opponent into the air, rather than figuring out what attack makes the opponent launch up in MVC2.  The L1 and R1 buttons are used, like before, to call your allies and assist you with whatever assist you gave them.  Also, they added new features, like X-Factor that powers up your character and can cancel ANYTHING (including Super Moves).  Also, they put in Team Aerial Combo, which allows you to call your allies and continue your combos.  There are many more add-ons in this game, so try it out!!Graphics:Shinkiro's beautiful artwork has made MVC3 look even better.  All the characters are 3D now, and they all are detailed!  The backgrounds are beautiful and aren't distracting to the players at all, but are there to provide a colorful place to kick your opponent's behind in.  Also, many characters make a cameo in the stages and the endings too.  Don't believe me? Play this game already!!Story Mode:Not much of a story here, but a new feature is that each character has their own ending (in which will give you Trophies when you complete them).  Even though The Fantastic Four aren't here, all your characters will come together to try and stop Galactus from destroying the Earth.Characters:The line-up is smaller than MVC2, but hey, I'm not complaining like others.  Many new characters are in this game, like Trish, Dante, She-Hulk, Thor, Deadpool and many more.  My little gripe about this is that if you got the Limited Edition for this game, you can't get Jill or Shuma Gorath until March 15th.  Many players will already have a team by then, and Jill and Shuma Gorath will be hard to add to their teams since it's one month from now.Gameplay:It's Marvel Vs. Capcom 3. That's all I have to say. Just kidding. The game allows you to play with your friends and with other players online easier than with MVC2.  Not only that, they added a Mission Mode for this game.  If you played Super Street Fighter IV or Blazblue: Continuum Shift, then you'll recognize this part.  Creating insane combos with EVERY character is in this mode, and actually helps you learn X-Factor Cancel and Team Assist easier than just playing the game.This game is amazing, hands-down.  I recommend this game to ANYONE, even children, as the game is exciting and will make players play this game for hours and hours!!Also, to note, the DLC for this game will be coming at a later date:1.  Jill and Shuma Gorath: $5 per character, available on March 15th.2.  Shadow Mode: a Free downloadable pack that features the Capcom's creators, like Ryota Niitsuma (the creator of MVC3), and their very own CPU-controlled teams for you to fight against.3. Alternative costumes for six characters: Ryu with his Street Fighter 1 costume (Red Hair anyone?), Chris Redfield in his RE1 costume, Dante looking like his father, Sparda, Captain America in a more modern outfit, Iron Man and his American costume, and Thor, in his original costume.

{"reviewerID": "A3RFCBJ6U5DLFN", "asin": "B003IEBO9Q", "reviewerName": "MisterMusicFan", "helpful": [38, 48], "reviewText": "After more than ten years of waiting, the follow-up to one of the most successful and well-known crossover gaming franchises at last arrives. Marvel VS. Capcom 3 breaks into the scene facing a great deal of expectations and anticipation, and in most aspects it delivers, but unfortunately it falls just a bit short of being the spectacular game it could have been.The gameplay and general mechanics are essentially a mishmash of those from both Marvel VS. Capcom 2 and Tatsunoko VS. Capcom. You're given three characters and a series of four core buttons to work with, those being Light, Medium, Heavy and Special attacks. This closely resembles the setup of TVC, simplifying things a bit from the punch and kick commands of MVC; a wise move, given that it generally trims the fat of the previous game's complexity.The Assists, Hyper Combos, crossovers and many other advanced tactics all return, but there are a handful of new alterations and quirks. For one, unlike TVC, there is no Mega Crash (although it is possible to break away from certain long combos) or Baroque; instead, there's the X Factor, a completely new tactic that may only be used once per match. X Factoring allows each of your characters a brief speed and power boost, along with gradual health recovery. These effects are strengthened depending on how many of your 3 characters are remaining (it is at its maximum if you only have one character left). This occasionally adds an interesting element to the gameplay, but many have argued that it's an unnecessary feature which can unfairly turn the tide of a fight, and there is definitely some validity to this complaint. Adding to the imbalance of this is the fact that different characters receive different boosts, leading to some characters gaining ridiculous power boosts while others don't really become much more of a threat.Switching out, or swapping characters, is unfortunately now a sorely obnoxious task, requiring the player to press and hold the Partner button until their other character appears; mistakenly tapping the button will cause a crossover Assist, and as many veteran players know, initiating an Assist when you're intending to switch out can cost you a character, or worse, a match. Needless to say, this can take a bit of getting used to, particularly for those accustomed to the simple back+/Partner command that came before.`Simple mode' from TVC also returns, allowing a significantly simplified control scheme in which special moves and Hyper Combos can be more easily initiated. This may sound unappealing or unfair to those more willing to adjust to the traditional controls, but simple mode also disallows certain attacks and abilities, so it's more of a tradeoff than a wholehearted handicap; it's ultimately a more accessible and user-friendly version of the control scheme.The roster has been among the most debated-over aspects of the game; MVC2 had a whopping 56 characters to choose from, while so far MVC3 only offers 36. Granted, unlike MVC2, you'll find no recycled sprites here; each and every character is brought to vivid new life and design. Many staples and favorites return, so fans of Ryu, Wolverine, Morrigan, Storm, and many others won't be complaining. Devil May Cry's Dante and X-Men's Deadpool are among some of the exciting new additions, while a surprising number of more obscure fan favorites also managed to make the cut. Some of the exclusions are rather upsetting, however, particularly the lack of Venom, certain X-Men characters and most shocking of all, Capcom's flagship character Mega Man. There's more downloadable content to come, however, so we'll have to see what the game's future has to offer.Some of the game's modes and single-player options are more disappointing than others; the online mode is overall pretty satisfying so far, allowing players to either log on for a quick match with a random player or friend, or join a lobby of several players in a sort of informal tournament system. Players can `friend' opponents they'd like to play again and even speak to one another through console-compatible microphones. Lag is generally minimal or non-existent, and thankfully you'll be forewarned of the connection strength in the lobbies before joining. There are also of course leaderboards and rankings for the best of the best, but you can only gain ranks through random Quick Matches, and sadly there's no spectator option; this is particularly frustrating when you're waiting around for your next match in the lobbies.The single-player modes aren't quite as satisfying. MVC3 has a rather standard Arcade mode which features nothing but a series of random battles followed by a boss fight and usually anticlimactic ending sequence which differs by character but is merely a brief series of still pictures and text. The end-game credits are nice the first time you watch them, but they're the same regardless of which character you win with, and therefore aren't nearly as interesting the second, third or fourth time around. Super Smash Bros. Brawl's Subspace Emissary wasn't what a lot of people were hoping for, but it was more engaging than what's offered here. Although the Arcade mode serves its generic purpose, a few more cutscenes or character-specific individuality would've made it really worthwhile.MVC3's biggest asset is it succeeds in a few of the key areas where both TVC and MVC2 failed. TVC offered an overly simplified control option which occasionally allowed for disproportionate advantages, and yet was oftentimes preferable to the needlessly complex alternative. MVC3 manages to find a healthy balance between MVC2's ice-cold complexity and TVC's desperate attempt at accessibility; both regular and simple mode in MVC3 are useable without being cheaply advantageous or impossible to understand. Although deeply advanced tactics will be reserved for deeply skilled players, as they always have been, most players will gain a deeper understanding of the control schemes offered here more quickly than they would have in MVC2.Unfortunately, as expected, opportunities to be cheap present themselves in MVC3 just as they do in most fighting games. Thankfully only a small handful of the characters seem genuinely broken or overpowered, but the ones that are can be truly frustrating to go up against; both Sentinel and Iron Man can fill the screen with enormous and heavily damaging beams and projectiles, while Phoenix becomes virtually impossible to approach, let alone defeat, once she transforms into Dark Phoenix. Ryu spammers are also expectedly back in action, but thankfully so far it doesn't seem quite as common as it was in TVC.The game has a visual style that is distinctly American and heavily influenced by comic books; as where MVC2's artwork and aesthetics felt more authentically Japanese, this game comes off as though it belongs a little more to Marvel than it does to Capcom. This works both for and against it; most of the Marvel characters look amazing, and several of the Capcom ones do as well, although the heavy Americanization of the likes of Tron Bonne and Morrigan can come off as a bit wonky at first. Aside from that, however, the visuals are vivid and gorgeous; one thing you'll never be bored with is what goes on onscreen during matches.Although the complaints may have seemed heavy, MVC3 is in fact a very entertaining and visually appealing game; the online mode is extremely fun and engaging, and some of the downloadable content to come, namely the new characters and complete costume revamps, seem very promising. Tuning up the roster and 1-player mode-adding more modes in general, for that matter-would have really made it nothing short of excellent, but here's hoping they really take popular demand into consideration for DLC.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great game, but not entirely what it could have been", "unixReviewTime": 1298073600, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2011"}

The only gripes I have with Marvel VS Capcom 3 is that the character roster isn't nearly as massive as it was the last time around, but that's understandable. However, while giving both Normal and Simple control schemes before you start playing gives button mashing gamers a whole new way to inflict damage.

I'm not going to be one of the hundreds of reviewers all saying the character roster was the problem, because it wasn't. I had no issues with the character choices what-so-ever. My gripe with the game is once you finish MvC3, there isn't much left to do.I remember playing MvC2 on my Dreamcast for months, unlocking colors, characters and stages in the game. It was a total time waster, but it was addicting trying to unlock and finish everything in the fighter. MvC3 needed this concept. I earned all the PS3 trophies in moderation and platinumed MvC3 in 10 days. When I was done, I looked at it wondering, \"so....what do I do now?\" The combo mode is wonderful and quite challenging. Other than that and arcade mode, you're done offline. Sure this is a step up from zero number of offline features in MvC2, but it's not saying much.Online mode is great, but it's pointless and not enough thought was put into it. One of my favorite features found in most current fighters is spectator mode. This allows you to observe other player matches as you wait your turn in line to battle the winner. It's fun and gives the players something to do as they wait for their upcoming matches. This feature is in Blazblue of all games. Even in Capcom's very own Super Street Fighter IV has this, but it's missing in MvC3. So when I'm playing with friends, I have to sit in boredom in a standardized player room waiting for matches to end. What's the point of having online if you're not going to do something unique and fun with it? To collect icons and titles? I don't see the point in that either.I believe this is an unfinished product. With Shadow Mode being added every week for $0.99 cents, special costumes to be added (for cash), and the possibility of future DLC characters (more moolah)....I just feel either Capcom is getting super greedy or the game is unfinished. The gameplay is fantastic and I will not knock it, but the features are presented as an after-thought. Honestly, if I see a Super Marvel vs. Capcom 3 down the road, I'm done with Capcom.

The reason is simple: character choices. It's not that there aren't enough characters to choose from, cause there are (however Capcom has had years to develop this game and easily could have included more), however its the fact that some of the characters that \"made the cut\" are just plain...weird. M.O.D.O.K? Seriously? Was there really a NEED to put him into the game? Taskmaster? I don't recall people lining up begging to have him as an addition to this widely anticipated release. However, despite some of the character selections currently available (omitting current and upcoming DLC characters of course), that's not what this game is all about, is it? No, it's about having FUN, and when it comes to having FUN, this game definitely delivers! The graphics are absolutely top-notch and the colors displayed on-screen are simply breath-taking. The online mode is pretty good as well, however I do have one minor complaint in that when you join a lobby (a type of mode that allows you to join with up to seven other players to fight against), you aren't allowed to watch the match that is taking place between two of the players within your lobby (if that makes sense). This is one of those cases where it would be much easier to see it than to explain it through text. However the bottom line with that is, you end up (sometimes) with a lot of idle time while waiting for a match to start (unless you enjoy staring at a dull screen until your time to fight commences). Each of the characters bring to the table their own unique fighting styles, some are more powerful, some are quicker, and some are ridiculously slow (a-hem...Arthur), however the developers at Capcom did a great job in balancing this all out (in my opinion).Having said all that, I definitely am impressed by what this game has offered so far, and I look forward to what lies ahead as far as future DLC is concerned. So if you're \"on the fence\" about picking this one up, I'd say at the very least, at least rent it, and if it turns out to be something you'd enjoy, buy it!

Seeing that there are so many game modes, ill discuss one more main mode, which is the my player mode, the rest you'll have to experience for yourself. They took this game mode to another level for sure. Not only can you live the full NBA experience on the court, but in the conference room where you'll be asked questions that will affect your league wide popularity, teammates chemistry and fan support depending on how you answer. Also what makes this mode more full and well rounded is being able to have endorsements and trade requests. All this adds a better experience to the game itself. The isomotion dribbling controls are amazing. They give a smooth and realistic feel to your moves on the court. These diverse controls offers a fantastic experience to the game play. Lastly, ill talk about the truly epic graphics which makes this game all the more better. I was shocked by how amazing these graphics looked. What impressed me the most was the facial expressions and emotions the players give during the course of a game. Weather it was a call a player didn't agree with, a hard foul or a missed shot, The emotions and expressions matched up perfectly. there are not enough words that can explain how good these graphics are. So that concludes my review, id recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the 2k franchise or is new to it and is looking for an all around fun gaming experience.I hope you all found this review helpful.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "NBA 2K is back, and better than ever", "unixReviewTime": 1311552000, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2011"}

It's great to see NBA leverage Jordan again. He is the best player to play the game, and to work him back in and be able to play with him at different points in his career is a lot of fun.

SINGH", "helpful": [56, 57], "reviewText": "I have been a 2k player for many years, I first started playing since 2K5 which was a great game as well. The last two years of NBA 2K have not been anything special, 2K10 felt like a minor leap over 2K9. However that is not the case this year, this game feels like a MAJOR leap over the previous games in the series, which I think most people didn't even think was possible.Graphics: Awesome, don't look at the gameplay videos, that tells a completely different story. When you actually play this game and look at it, the motions are amazing, particularly how the great the equipment on the players move when the characters run down the court. The facial expressions are also amazing, and give you an amazing feeling during highlights. Also the skin tones and the Tattoos all look good, and are placed in the right spot.The only knock on the graphics that I can say is how some of the characters have an unnatural look to them (Jermaine Oneal, Larry Bird, and even Kobe to some extents look weird). The UI and the menu system is very nice though, something 2K games have always been good at. The courts are also done in amazing detail and look good down to the last piece of hardwood floor. There is so much more to be said about the graphics, but its hard to sum it all up, the graphics all around are good I would rate them an 8 out of 10 definitely the best looking in the series.Sound: The sound is solid, the court sounds sound legit, the way the shoes sound during a quick stop and the way the ball sounds as your are dribbling and how it sounds when it goes in the net is perfect. The soundtrack for this game is very good, its definitely improving over the previous years versions and the best so far. You got Snoop, Drake, Big Boi, Cassidy, Kid Cudi, and even Ron Artest (lol). The sound is great, and the play by play is truly amazing. You really think you are watching the game, 2K has always been strong here after playing a couple of matches, I rarely heard the same things said in different games during pick up games, which is amazing. The announcers always have an amazing way in season mode/My Player mode of talking about when the season is coming to an end, and what place your current team is at in their conference which is amazing.  They certainly put a lot of time and effort in the play by play which makes the ambience much better.Controls: Not a lot to say here, in one word it's great. If you have used the 2K controls before it will be like second nature here, its very easy for even beginners to pick up and play. After one full match from the beginning to end, you will already have a strong grasp on the controllers. So just solid here, and still one of the best things about 2K basketball games.Gameplay: A game changer, everything feels like its been improved from before. They still have all the legitimate traits of older games before this one. Lebron shoots like lebron, he has his signature shot, and his signature blocks, its scarily realistic with how they made so many players play like themselves. Tons of research had to go in for it to be this accurate. The new thing for this year is the jordan challenges. Believe it or not, this pays homage to the older 2K games. If you play NFL 2K5 (Rip) they had a mode where you can go back and play legendary games and win these game and do what those teams have done. Well, its back now, and you get to use all the amazing Bulls teams from 90's with Jordan. they also recreated all the rosters so that it is the same roster as jordan was with and the teams that he played against. So the challenges are like score 63+, plays his flu game, etc. Its really an amazing thing that they created here for the greatest basketball player of all time. The My Player mode is truly amazing, you start as basically a nobody, you create your character and when you are all finished you choose what kind of player you would like to be (scoring, passing, defensive, etc.) once you do that it assigns point to your player that can be used to build different stats. You start out in the draft combine, be impressive and you get drafted once you do, you start competing in the summer league. From there, now you are fighting for a roster spot, its really amazing and actually shows you the process of what these players have to do when they are coming to the NBA, amazing. Online, I have played about 5 games, and I have to say that its been great! No lag, and there has been no server problems which have been a huge knock on 2K basketball games online, it's looking good so far however.EDIT 11/26/2010: Yep decided to edit this one, bought it since launch and I am still playing it even now, on black friday and also a month and a half after its release. The rating would not change at all this truly is an amazing game, you must try it for yourself!Overall: IGN called this game one of the greatest sports games of our generation, and they are right. Nothing really quite matches everything it offers. If you play this game online and offline, you can easily surpass over 100 hours of gameplay before you know it. Throw in Jordan challenges, My player mode, and online in general, and you have a deep game with more to come back to each time you turn it on, THIS is what 2K basketball is all about.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An Evolution of something that was already great", "unixReviewTime": 1286323200, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2010"}

I'm sure the hype and feedback wasn't there and the bugs not worked through for them to come out with it. That's fine. Props to EA for being smart and waiting rather than rushing Elite 11 just to make a dollar.They made a promising turn around in Live 10.

Even when he was still playing ball he never got included in the games, which is kind of weird. To be quite honest with you, his inclusion is the only really great thing about this game. The game itself is all kinds of broken, which only leaves you feeling frustrated.I don't want to see any comments on here saying \"looks like someone is bitter because he lost\" or \"you just need to practice\" because both of those are wrong. I don't mind losing in sports games, it isn't that big of a deal to me. In regards to the second point, I've had this game for a year and a half so I've practiced plenty. I keep reading reviews that say this is the most realistic basketball game ever. How? It's not realistic visually or gameplay wise. All the players look like distorted versions of themselves and the jerseys are all stiff like cardboard. Then you have the abomination that is the gameplay.There's times when an opponent will shoot a jumper from inside the perimeter, he scores, and it counts as a three. I can't even say \"sometimes\" because it happens a lot. There's times when you pass it to someone on the post and the opponent shoves him out of bounds as soon as he catches the ball. Then there's the god awful shooting mechanics. I mean seriously, there's no real formula as to how the mechanics work. It all comes down to luck. You can go on for days about how \"there's a steep learning curve\" but we all know that's bs for \"it's broken.\" Demon's Souls has a steep learning curve, this is insanity.I can't tell you how many times I've had a wide open shot or lay-up and my player misses completely. Which brings me to the next two points: 1) You never get the luck of the roll on the rim 2) Your player becomes useless once the ball leaves your hands. The opponent? 99% he will get the luck of the roll. You? No. What I mean by useless is exactly what the Websters dictionary defines it as: not able to give service or aid. He basically becomes a statue for a full second so even if you miss the lay-up you have no real shot at getting the rebound.Finally, trying to run a play is a nightmare. First off they're all extremely long so unless you have the positions memorized there's no point in trying. Secondly, it feels like there's some sort of invisible barrier stopping you from even getting to your destination. Running plays is supposed to make it easier to get an open look, it's not suppose to make you want to throw your controller at the TV.I didn't even get into the other things like the terrible menu or the awful My Player mode, but all this negativity is bringing me down. Bottom line is this: don't get this game. Especially if you're looking for a basketball game you can just pick up and play every now and then. This isn't the game for that kind of player.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Broken and overrated", "unixReviewTime": 1351209600, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2012"}

Amazingly, the team outdid itself this year.The inclusion of Jordan and his playable retrospective smartly opens up the game to anyone with a passing interest in basketball. It also breaks the stigma that each year's game is just a roster update. While it seems Pippen plays like crap, it's a wonderful mode that will give you several hours of play. You'll be amazed how many hoop heroes make appearances, and are thus playable.The rest of the game is as rock-solid as ever. I can play a season for simply taking a team to the championships, or use The Association to be more GM-centric. Minigames like the dunk contest and 3-point shootout provide nice diversions. My Player is still here, though I haven't played it much after not really liking it in 2K10. But basically, there is a TON of game here that will keep you occupied throughout the season.This game demands a high basketball IQ -- even on lower difficulty levels. You really have to use your head to outsmart the AI. Otherwise, it will pick off your passes and posterize you early and often. That's actually a positive, since it teaches you to be a better player.Some old issues still exist that I really wish would get cleaned up. The trade screen only displays 4 slots per team, but at times the computer will hide a fifth item off-screen. Passes are extremely imprecise unless you use Icon Passing.

Only 2k10 I would say did not exceed my expectations, but that's given that Michael Wang (Head Gameplay Designer)was with EA at the time.NBA 2K11 hands down the best basketball game created.  It gives a great feature with Michael Jordan Challanges and unlockable shoes and a different revamped gameplay.  It takes some time to adjust to the new controls, but it is well worth it.  The gameplay is slowed down a bit, which is much more realistic.  The AI is much more smarter and plays with more improvisation which makes it more challenging, but not over the top difficult.  The only bad thing I would say is that I was a little nitpicky about the camera view.  On broadcast, you cannot turn off the key zoom, which I usually don't play with, but eventually I got used to it.  I also experienced some minor glithces with dunks and got a little agitated with the hop step dunks that happen pretty frequently.

Let me tell you why.I think 2K11 is when the game finally crossed over from \"flat-out unrealistic\" to \"semi-realistic\". Granted, a basketball video game will probably never get close to being realistic, but that's what makes them fun.Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that 2K11 got more realistic in ways that don't detract from the fun of the game.For example, passing is now much more difficult. Gone are the days of just lasering the ball to any player on the court regardless of defenders or positioning. In 2K11, if there's a defender between you and the man you're trying to pass to, the ball WILL get stolen. Sounds like a simple concept, but nobody seemed to be able to get that right until now. Speaking of passing, alley-oops are also much harder to do than in 2K10. Nowadays the dunker better have a clear lane to the hoop; he won't magically jump through a defender and hammer it home. Also, if you're trying to throw the alley-oop pass, your defender will deflect it if he's guarding you closely.All these factors force the player to make more careful decisions instead of playing a sloppy run and gun game filled with unrealistic passes and dunks.Aside from the passing, the difficulty when dribbling has also increased. If you try to bring the ball up court with one of your big men, prepare to have it picked pretty quickly. One of the things that used to bother me about the older 2K games is that when you dribbled and collided with another defender, your player would just keep running in place like there was no real contact between the two players. Now in 2K11, if you run into a defender, an actual collision will take place. Your player will recoil from the impact and it will take some time to recover before you can drive or shoot again. Either that or you will just lose control of the ball altogether.So basically, 2K11 went for a slower paced, more realistic, and more `tactical' approach this time around. But don't worry. You're still going to see plenty of high flying dunks and oops, and plenty of sweet dimes too. You're just going to have to be smarter and more careful with the way you go about things.Overall, the game plays great and there's only one thing I can complain about. Sometimes on an open dunk, your player will perform an extra and unnecessary move. I was on a breakaway with J.R. Smith the other day and I was hoping to see a crazy two-handed windmill from the free throw line. Instead, he does a spin move under the basket and goes up for a regular dunk. This has happened multiple times with other players as well. I'm not sure if it's a glitch or if I just haven't learned to play correctly yet.OK, enough with the gameplay, now onto the visuals. The graphics and interface are the best yet in the series, but they're not amazing. The animations on the other hand, are awesome. I don't want to say too much, but me and my buddy went crazy when MJ went for a baseline rock the cradle dunk in the middle of a pickup game!Well, that's all I can say for now since I've only put a couple hours into this game, playing head-to-head with my buddies. I have yet to try the single player and online modes, but for a casual player like myself, this is about all I could ask for in a bball game.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Huge Improvement Over Previous Efforts", "unixReviewTime": 1286323200, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2010"}

I can barely remember all the button combos and needing to know the X's and O's of football and basketball eventually get the best of me.  Hence my last Madden game had me googling nickel and dime and 3-3-4 defenses vs blitzes etc just to win a few games.Three things pulled me into this game:1.  No More College Basketball Games.  Wasn't overly impressed with the last EA NCAA Basketball 2010 game, and unfortunately a new version didn't come out this year (and may never again).2.  Tired of Madden.3.  Michael Jordan.  Yes, he's the best ever.  Statistically, he far surpasses Kobe and any other current player.  I actually stopped watching NBA shortly after Jordan retired (for the 2nd time) and hence haven't been all the excited to play an NBA game.Wow, I don't know if 2k Sports has always been this much better than EA Sports' basketball games, but this game will WOW you.  I've never seen anything like it.  Call of Duty will wow you with atmosphere and details.  NBA 2k11 will wow you with amazing likeness of the real NBA.  And to top it off, it actually makes me want to start watching the NBA again!Playing as Michael Jordan is priceless.  The $59.00 for that feature alone was worth it.  His dunks, fist pumps, shrugs, all make me reminisce of those glory days.  Don't know how they did it, but they sure got his likeness down.  It doesn't just look like a computer animated basketball player - it actually looks like Jordan when he dunked.Then I played some of the other classic teams.  The Sonics.  Watching Kemp dunk sure looked like I remember him.Some of the players don't look as real as Jordan, but hey, this game is all about him.  Kobe looks odd, Larry Bird just looks bad.  But I having watched a few highlight reels of Wade and LeBron, I can say that they sure nailed those two as well.If I could ask for 1 thing, it'd be to be able to get the Phoenix Suns and Charles Barkley - My other favorite team for that era.  Maybe they'll have it for DLC.Honestly, I don't know how they can top this game next year.  It's that good.  You've probably heard the drama about EA Sports NBA Live getting bad reviews from their demo, and after NBA2k11 came out, they decided to not release NBA Live this year, and focus on next year instead.  I don't want to read too much into it, you can see from the other reviews as well: NBA 2k11 is the best basketball game ever.My favorite part though, is the montage they put at the end of each game.  It shows highlight reels for your Player of the Game, with awesome music.  But it's they way they do it.  They'll change the colors, freeze players on a break-away or dunk, or make it black and white except your player (or maybe the basketball).  It looks awesome, and when playing with friends, it's one of the funnest parts of the game.  After the game ends, we'll all be:  \"quiet quiet, it's time for the Player of the Game!\".One final note:  The commentaries.  Fantastic.  I can't tell you how frustrating it was to play Madden and hear them tell me nonsense that either didn't make sense for the play that just happened, or was just gibberish.  The commentaries here are fantastic.  Sure, there's some repeats, but it's still fun to listen to.

And I'm not talking about just long outlet passes to ignite the fast break. Alot of my passes into the post get picked and I'm standing around the 3 point line. This really discourages ball movement. I even tried moving the game sliders and this didnt help.The second thing is defense. The AI team you play against is all NBA Defense, even if you are playing a crappy defensive team like the Phoenix Suns or the New York Knicks. Whats worse is that your AI controlled defenders on the other end suck! They often play way off of players. Basically their team is on you like white on rice. I might have had 2 or 3 fast breaks that were succesfull in the 3 weeks I've played this game(I only play on weekends). However I've seen the AI have open shots and uncontested dunks a 4-6 times a game. Their passes don't get stolen at the same frequency as your will. This game was a huge let down.

Of course the graphics and the music is great, and also I love all the options you have- you can play the Association, A season, or my player where your created player gets drafted and goes to the league. However, the game is just not realistic for several reasons- #1- there is no way a player can be a 90% three point shooter and not make one three-pointer. #2-there is no way a guy can be drafted to the NBA as a top ten pick in the first round, and also a starter, and not make a single lay-up or a shot directly in front of the basket. #3- the directional buttons are a failure, because you can select the triangle or the circle to throw a direct pass and the computer will make you do otherwise. #4-every time you go for a fast-break or on a run, the Heat button comes up on the screen or what's happening around the league screen comes up in the middle of an awesome play or in the middle of passing the ball #5- the game is supposed to be realistic to the current teams line-ups, why did they have Steve Nash playing for the Mavericks? And Kirk Thomas playing for the Knicks? ((HELLO)) they haven't played for those teams since they first came into the league. #6-the online game playing is fun, but freezes up each time a player leaves the game. #7- it is hard for you and another person to play each other without the controllers getting mixed up- example- I end up being the Laker when I selected the Celtics and my opponent ends up being the Celtics when they selected the Lakers.  Now- the My Player- the one who gets drafted- OH MY!  First of all, you can play your heart out and the game will give you a \"C\". It's like they expect you to play ALL positions. If a Center is passed the ball and your Center does not block him, then it's your fault- the game will tell you that you allowed the shot. Really? I am the point guard. One game, I met all the requests it said to do during the game- make at least 3 jumpshots, limit your man to less than 40 percent shooting. I did all of that and then some and the game said \"Fair\". Even when I was the only player playing defense and offense. Who judges the game, hockey players?  The only reason I keep playing the game is because there are no other b-ball games out right now.

No other way to put it.I have not found one flaw in this game other than Kobe's head looking like that of an alien!!The highlight of this game is the Jordan Challenges and MJ: Create a Legend. These 2 modes will keep you hooked. The challenges are very, well..challenging! For each it took me a couple of tries.. After you have completed all challenges you will know why MJ is the greatest, he went up against some tough opponents.MJ:Create a Legend is basically the same as The Association except you will only control MJ on both offense and defense. You can place Jordan on any team. I put MJ on the only team he belongs in, the Bulls! It actually makes him a perfect fit for today's Bulls to compliment Boozer, Noah and Rose. MJ starts off with the same skills as he was when he was a rookie, more of a flashy player, great at close range with his jaw dropping dunks and lay-ups but with a mediocre jump shot. As you complete certain objectives, milestones you will gain skill points you can use to upgrade his attributes. I am only half way through the first season and his overall rating is 93.In my opinion, NBA 2K11 sets itself apart cause of the detailed attention to each aspect of the game. As many reviews have stated, playing against the Mavericks will feel different than playing against the Celtics due to their respective playing styles. You will see the difference if Kobe is guarding you vs. if a lesser defensive skilled player is guarding you... and many other aspects of this game is amazing, too many to name!!Overall, this game is a MUST-HAVE!!

NBA2K11 has set a standard that the EA Sports division as a whole needs to take note of. But then the 2K sports series always seems to have been doing this for awhile now and the only thing that is saving EA Sports right now is its lock on the NCAA and NFL licenses.From the moment the game starts, you know you are in for a treat as the `new gimmick' of Jordan's addition is clearly apparent. But for those of us that have been gaming for awhile aren't looking at this as a gimmick. I know for myself, the opening game from the 1991 Finals brought back memories of the first of the EA Sports games for the Genesis Bulls vs Lakers but now it's come back full circle. High res graphics, player models and and great commentary (even a YOUNG Phil Jackson!) makes me almost cry! Remembering that all those years ago, the closest we got to playing this game were sprites and numbers makes this game a dream come true!So, let me stop waxing nostalgic and talk about everything else. While the opening game is great, for those that could care less about this are going to be frustrated that they can't immediately go through to the menu. To me, that is one minor negative but once you do get through that one thing that I did like was that 2K cleaned up the mess of an interface from last year and made the menus this year a lot easier to navigate through. As always, customize as you see fit.Some may complain that this game is another roster update but I know for myself, I played 2K6 and 2K7, skipped 8 and 9 but I got last year's game and was amazed with the Living NBA feature which has made it back and the NBA Today feature.  One thing that I have always loved about this series that EA Sports needs to take notes on, is that the 2K Sports series doesn't always try to throw a gimmick every year with a `new controller feature' or something so totally lame that it breaks the game instead of enhancing it (YES EA GAMEFLOW IS BULLHOEY!!). To its core, NBA2K11 is essentially the same game that you have played for years following the philosophy of `if it ain't broke don't fix it\" but the beauty of this is 2K spent more time tinkering with improving the AI and player animations and it shows. The control scheme is essentially the same but the ball animations and player reactions to the controls have improved much since last year. Playing around with NBA 2K11 shows that given time, it almost becomes a living breathing thing that, if you didn't know any better, you were watching an actual game rather than a video game.Now as much as I like Jordan, one small distraction is that the game is littered with almost any and everything Jordan throughout the game but considering what it takes to get him to endorse anything and because of those endorsements, products will sell, I can let it slide.One thing that is fun however are the Jordan challenges and if that is this year's `gimmick' which  came along with getting Jordan to endorse this game, it's a great one and I spent a lot of time trying to play through these challenges so I can unlock Jordan. I haven't done it yet but I have unlocked a few of the sneakers!I won't repeat too much of what the previous reviewers have said but getting back to the presentation as always it's slick even in between quarters, watching a pseudo commercial about upcoming matches tends to be fun, the  time show is a bit more improved this time around as I liked how the commentating crew talks about other games being played in the league now I am wondering if I started playing the Association, if there will also be game highlights. The commentary and crowd reaction is as kinetic as ever and people always tend to get on the commentators repeating things but I mean come on, we know it's going to happen, but the commentating on here is better than what you get in some EA games. It's still cool to hear them talk about your player's performance from a few nights ago and instead of making up some imaginary number, that stat was indeed true.As far as other extras, I tinkered around with the black court games and with that came some of the usual suspects of 21, 3pt Shootout and more.  Definitely always worth looking at when you aren't in the mood for a full out 5 on 5 confrontation.But there is one negative and that is the Move controller. I think any game that gets Move support needs to have a calibration/tutorial session built in before they just toss you to the wolves. It took me about 15 minutes to properly set my Move stick and I wasn't all that crazy about trying to play this with my dualshock. I also have the new Nav stick and could not figure out how to get it to work with the Move controller so if anyone has pointers on getting it to work, please let me know but the Move right now as it is, feels more like an afterthought than well thought out.Otherwise, if you are a basketball fan or sat out of the 2K phase, then this is the time to get it. As I said, EA needs to take notes and it's no surprise that their franchise has been put on hold. 2K takes your expectations and surpasses them by making a sports game that easy to get into and hard to put down once you start to play. If you are a Jordan fan and want to relive some of his past glory, then this is as close as you are going to get short of a holodeck and once you unlock him you get to use him against today's youth so forget trying to recreate him in Create a Player, YOU HAVE HIM.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If it's in the game...it's in there plus some.", "unixReviewTime": 1286323200, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2010"}

Since they went and gave you all the positives I'll focus on the negatives.  This is not a negative review but flaws I found to be annoying in an outstanding game and possibly the best sports game ever made.I've had the game since launch and haven't even gone to the Jordan Challenge yet because I've been stuck on Association mode.  Trading is realistic in that you can't entice a team with scrubs and some draft picks for Dwayne Wade.  They will aggressively pursue your good players in a chance to get something back in return.  If I want LeBron (I would never but hypothetically) then I will have to trade Dwight Howard and a first rounder at least.  I also love the idea of draft day trades.  However, computer generated rookies often come in rated way too high.  1st pick coming in at an 84 is unrealistic.  Danny Granger starts off at like an 83.The player development is still iffy at best and I still do not like the development points and only being able to develop a player once a month.  It just seems dumb to me.  Also there are not enough drills for the attributes.  There's a shooting drill but it will not improve 3 pt shooting or Free Throws, developing a back to the basket game is completely useless because 9 times out of 10 the player is not good enough to make the necessary amount of shots to even upgrade.  The dribbling drill has always been dumb, with that weave through cones nonsense.  Strength, shoot in traffic, ball security, passing (a whole nother paragraph) and many more attributes cannot be upgraded via drills.  It's just dumb.  This results in manually editing players and you know how that goes with 99% of people lol Dwight Howard will turn into Hakeem Olajuwon on offense.Well I still don't like the player attitudes.  Way too often everyone thinks they should start.  If I have Joe Johnson at Shooting Guard, no other shooting guard will start over him unless their name is Wade or Kobe.  Far too often, these rookies, bench players, bout to retires, and journeymen will grumble about playing time where there is no way to check them unless it's through more playing time or a trade.  We need the reality check option and should be based on the coach's rating and accomplishments.  Players with a 73 rating thinking they should be starting over my 90 SG get out of here.  This also hurts when trying to build a solid bench.  It wouldn't be so much of a problem except it messes up team chemistry and lowers the rating of the player.  The coaches don't progress.  So if the team makes the playoffs 5 years in a row your coach will still be a D, assistant coaches still cannot be promoted to head coach, and coaches 10 years in the league retire for no reason.Also the season tasks are limited once again.  Win the division, make the playoffs, etc. are nice milestones but what about a team leading the league in scoring or in defense?  What about a player leading the league in rebounding?  Win the regular season series against your rivals, Win one playoff series, Win two playoff series? Hold Kevin Durant under 25 pts...etc. etc.  These things could add more development points at the end of the season for development of players but now as it's structured only the good teams and their players get better.  What about Kevin Love?  Can he get some development points playing for the worst team in the league?  Probably not.  And once again at the end of the season I should be able to send Josh Smith to shooting camp and rebounding camp or as many camps as I please.There's a few aspects of gameplay that I want to address as well.  The first is the very awful passing system.  I understand that players must make smart passes and all that good stuff.  However, I saw more deflected passes in 5 games of NBA 2K11 than I have in an entire season of watching NBA on TV.  It borders to the point of ridiculousness.  If an NBA player can't pass from the wing to the post, or from the high post to the wing, or from middle of the court 3 pt line to the wing then they have no use in the NBA.Passes on fast breaks are too often stolen while the computer completes the same court length pass on their break.  The simplest passes get stolen or tipped and most of the time it's horse booboo.  But the computer is throwing alley oops with Dwight Howard standing right in the paint.  The same pass that gets stolen 98% of the time for you the computer makes that same dumb pass and converts it. The game also has the weird habit of bypassing a player.  For example I have Dwight on the block.  Instead of passing it to Dwight you will send a cross court pass across the lane and several defenders that will end up getting stolen.  I should not have to icon pass to player standing right next to me.The fast breaks are pretty bad as well and it's something they haven't gotten quite right since...well...ever.  Players frequently (and I do mean frequently) get caught from behind on a fast break.  Two on ones are impossible because of the horrible mechanic of passing and the unrealistic percentage of tipped passes.  A two on one will probably be stolen by the sole point guard back to defend the fast break or he will body my 220 lb SF running full speed.  Also players leading the fast break still run to the 3 point line for no apparent reason when only the trailers should be running to the three point line.  The defensive fast break is even worse because even though you've gotten back to prevent the fast break the computer still completes the pass through 3 of my defenders en route to a layup or dunk.  A lot of times the first one back will run away from the basket for no reason allowing a computer player to get a layup...it's just crazy.  They will be standing there defending the basket and then just move for no reason as soon as the opposition comes.The last gripe is that players change directions slowly when you have them but are as fluid as ever with the computer controlling them.  I can't even halfway show a double team without the ball being kicked out to a wide open player and my player unable to change directions like he's stuck in the mud.  These are pro athletes they can change directions quickly.  I could see if it was like Dirk Nowitzki or somebody but a standard NBA guard should be able to show a double team and get back at least in an athletic motion.  Also after a pump fake and the defender is in the air it's nearly impossible to just run right by them without them making an unrealistic recovery.  It's to the point of ridiculousness.  The defender jumps and before you can even take a dribble he's back on the ground and recovered.Another thing, Andre Miller is not unstoppable.  When he goes 4-4 from the 3 point line and 7-7 from the field hitting runners, one leg off balance jumpers and fade-away jumpers on Superstar level then something is fundamentally wrong with the system.Also the speed of some players is just ridiculous.  Why John Wall can't outrun centers on the court is beyond me.  It seems everyone is the same speed with the quick guards having an extra burst.  John Wall, LeBron, Tony Parker etc. need to be way faster and noticeably faster than Al Horford.**2K has opened a whole can of worms with the historic teams and players.  For the next game it should be a way to unlock these players and then throw in a few more of the outstanding players such as Reggie Miller, MVP Allen Iverson, young T-Mac, MVP Shaq, young Jason Kidd, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon, young Larry Johnson etc. and have little challenges to unlock those guys too like score 100 points in a game, score 11 points in 45 seconds etc.**", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The other side", "unixReviewTime": 1291075200, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2010"}
{"reviewerID": "A1N2J7Q1WNQK25", "asin": "B003IMGC9U", "reviewerName": "E.S.", "helpful": [109, 117], "reviewText": "You may consider this a premature review, but I thought I would share my initial feelings about the game anyways.  It really doesn't matter the company, whether 2K or EA, but whenever the yearly edition of your favorite sports game is released, it's painfully obvious that the transition between one year to the next is subtle at best.  Thankfully 2K doesn't simply add a new feature and highlight it as EA does year in and out with their games.  For NBA 2K11, 2K knew it could not let down the legions of Jordan fanboys and fanatics worldwide by pushing out an inferior product and let me tell you, 2K11 has NOT disappointed me thus far.  I received this game approximately 4 hours ago, THANK YOU UPS GUY, and after 4 hours of non-stop play, I am VERY satisfied.  I'll attempt to break down what I've seen.Pros:1) Michael FREAKING Jordan.  His presence is already the showstopper part of the game, but 2K does not simply include him in a \"Legendary\" team and call it quits.  No, Sir.  As you've already read, they include him on 10 of his legendary Bulls teams whether to relive his classic moments or to use them against current teams.  Another cool feature is the ability to unlock all his Jordan brand shoes where upon wearing them, your player will gain specific stat boosts.2) Inclusion of other legendary teams.  They didn't have to, but they so kindly did.3) Improved AI.  Every year 2K and EA claim they have more life-like AI, this year is different.  Basically once you pop the game in the disk you're already playing as a Jordan-led team and the difficulty was on Pro.  I noticed immediately that the same passes to cutters will not fly.  I played 2K10 on Hall of Fame and those passes were money.  Well, not anymore. It takes a lot more know-how and timing to get things right and I couldn't be happier.4) Buttons and moves.  By this I mean 2K tweaked the buttons slightly and it's made things easier in my estimation.  Circle no longer sets your picks (rather it is the \"fake pass\" button), as it's now L1.  Pushing L1 calls your screener to get into position and releasing it tells him to roll.  Rather than allowing the AI to determine when they should roll allows the player to better gauge what the best play will be.  You can call a quick screen so that he simply slows the guy guarding you down and allow you to blow by for a layup or dunk, or you can set an adequate pick-and-roll (that would make Stockton and Malone happy) by allowing your screener to have a head full of steam before getting the ball.  Performing moves is a lot easier for me this time around, it's hard to get into detail so you'll have to see for yourself.  I say moves are a positive this time around because of the newly added animations allow for more variation when trying to break your defender down.5) Clear difference between Stars and nobodies.  When you're using a superior player and an inferior player guards you, performing moves will easily allow you to \"brush your shoulder\" of the guy.  For instance, if you're using Derrick Rose and Robin Lopez switches to guard you, he's basically screwed.  Higher ball skill ratings vs. lower speed means when you do a move against him, he'll be left in the dust.  Also, star players definitely shine in this game.  If you're using MJ or Kobe, being guarded perfectly doesn't mean your shot will clank.  Everybody knows these two make/made impossible shots, as ridiculous as it looks/seems, they did it for real and you can do it in the game.  Using Kobe in 2K10 was semi-frustrating because it would've been nice if I could've made some of those difficult shots that he makes in reality, now I can see them drop more often that not.  Just my preference that I'd like to see some contested shots go down since some guys can pull it off. Again, you need to see for yourself how clear the difference is now.6) Improved layout & presentation.  You could do without this, but it does look nicer. Presentation looks especially cool, what you'd expect if you were watching a game on ESPN or any other live TV station.  Massive improvement here that wasn't necessary but is absolutely a pleasure to have.7) My Player.  A lot of the things here will seem familiar to you, but 2K did add nice features here and there and allow for a more variation when developing your player.  The combinations of shots, moves, etc. are endless. This feature was already solid in 2K10, but 2K added some nice little features here and there.8) Graphics.  I think the graphics this year around are fairly crisp and to anybody griping about looks, have you ever considered that maybe companies have already maxed out on how great these games can look?  1080p is basically the standard and if it doesn't look as good as you think it should be, try getting an LED tv and then get back to me.Cons:1) Same announcers, but they did add some new one liners.  Either way, playing two games successively means you hear them rant about the same things.  I don't think any game developer is willing to pay two new guys to announce their games every year.2) I have not encountered any bugs thus far, but I suppose with more playing I'll see something? (SEE UPDATE)Conclusion:I think when word got out how amazing 2K11 was, EA finally accepted what they already knew.  They were pushing out an inferior product year after year.  It's never been more obvious this year as EA delayed their interpretation of basketball by 5 (FIVE!) months.  If anybody even tried their demo, I don't blame them.  Frankly, I'd get this game just for the Jordan factor... but I thank 2K Sports for merely letting his presence be an attention grabber while letting their actual game do the talking.  Whether you're a 2K or Live/Elite fanboy, you really owe it to yourself to get this game.  2K didn't have to add a lot of the stuff that they did, but they did so anyways because they really wanted to prove to people that they've mastering their craft with dedication and thought.  I hope that anybody who reads this review got something out of it because ever since popping the game in, I really felt the need for everyone else out there to see what I saw.  If you have any questions or think I'm talking out of my ass, please let me know!  And in the future, don't let EA sell you on their Great Balls of Fire (NBA JAM) to buy their games!  Quality will always win out against HYPE!UPDATE 9/10/10The more and more I play this game, the more I am impressed.  The emphasis this year around was actually SIMULATION of basketball.  This is why so many casual gamers are upset, because they can't simply pick up the controller and score 50 with any star player as they'd hope.  As good as those players are in real life, it's still insanely hard to pull it off on any given night, as it is in the game as well.Year in and year out, the AI is ALWAYS a big issue. Game reviewers and connoisseurs, like myself and I'm sure many of you, always complain about the simpleton computer.  Hall of Fame is NEVER a challenge....... until NOW.  I read a review somewhere else on Amazon, complaining about how hard it was to score and how 2K made the game worse.  These complaints are RIDICULOUS because the guy clearly didn't know what this game's about.However, I've seen a few things that annoyed me.1) Throwing hail mary passes don't work when you're doing them, but the computer can underhand a hail mary pass directly the guy down court.2) Where are the Kobe shoes?3) The new dunk contest.  I preferred last year's version, though I'm glad that Sprite guy who announces it is gone.These little things bug me, but the game is otherwise flawless.  Game play is authentic and the animations are amazing.My advice to anybody in the market for a basketball game is that, know what you're purchasing before you buy it.  If you want some fantasy game where you can do whatever the hell you like and score a million points, you can purchase a copy of Live 2001-forseeable future or even a pre NBA 2K-11 2K game.  This is the finest sports SIMULATION game ever and with that said, you cannot seriously expect to have things be handed to you when playing this.

Shimkus \"Movie Manji\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "NBA2k11 features Michael Jordan, and as I grew up with video games ever since the NES days, I can tell you that there were many basketball games that he didn't allow himself to be in. This game is like a makeup for all those lost years when they had some guy on the bulls, with no profile picture, and some generic name, but usually had mad skills! But even if you hate Jordan (i.e. Jazz fans), NBA2K11 is better than last years game, which had terrible team defense, with a hard to master shooting stick.The gameplay is much smoother. On defense, you aren't so inclined to crouch down in some crab defensive posture, when instead you are trying to prevent a fast break. You back peddal at such a brisk pace that you are allowed to make some little mistakes on defense without basically giving the keys to the paint to quicker guards now. It seems as though the defense is still filled with some glitches though. It is very hard to pass to who you want everytime. I average way too many turnovers because of this, and the commentators are never slow in pointing that out either. And the defenders have great hands, and are always looking to deflect your passes, no matter how skilled of a passer you may have. Put the two problems together and you have moments when you get really mad, and offense can turn to defense really quick. You better learn how to defend the fast break unless you have found a way with the your playstation move controller that my PS3 dual shock control can't do, because you are going to give up the rock tryin to feed the post. Even on simple pick and rolls, on seemingly money plays, at the last moment the defending center can at the last moment raise his arm (with the back of his head faced to you!) and make the deflection!Some of the amazing things that I have never seen in a basketball game are dynamic stadiums. Some games are not very filled with fans, while Laker games are really energetic! Nitpicking here, the Staples center usually lowers the lighting on the audience, and sometimes I felt that they had too much lighting on the crowd, and also, they had the crowd all in their seats at the beginning of the game. If you have been a Laker fan for long, you will know that Laker fans are awesome, but they are usually late to the game LOL! But this is a fantastic element to the game that I am amazed with!Although I feel the graphics altogether to be better than last years, it does seem as though some of the players don't look like who they are supposed to be. I felt that Derek Fisher's game persona, looked really bad! And Kobe still looks like an alien, like last years. But I really enjoyed some of the reactions of the players. There are some really spot on behaviors done by alot of players.As time goes by and I play more of this game, I hope to add more to my review. So far, I absolutely love playing classic Michael Jordan games, and seeing a better game dynamic than ever before. I have much to learn about this years game, even though I have played last years version alot, it is much different.

To me, 5 stars is a perfect game.  This game isn't perfect. If people out there are being objective, they have to admit that the EA series(NBA Live, now NBA Elite) has better graphics.  I'm disappointed by the player models to be honest.  It's 2011.  Why doesn't Kobe look like Kobe?  Why doesn't Westbrook look like Westbrook?  When players walk off the court, they'll frequently bump into each other and walk in place as if they were on a treadmill.I know gameplay is the most important aspect of a sports game, and gameplay is great which is why i rate the game a 5 in terms of fun.  But to me, graphics are an important part of the overall enjoyment of the game.The 3 point shooting contest is fairly boring because it takes place on an outdoor basketball court and there's no crowd cheering you on.  It's very quiet.Is the game difficult?  It can be, but you can modify the difficulty in so many ways.  There is casual, default, and simulation; then there are 5 actual levels of difficulty.  That means you have 15 different total levels of difficulty.  Play on casual/rookie, you'll win by 20.  Play on simulation/legend(or is it all-star?) and you'll lose by 50(if you suck like me).There are many many features in this game and i would have to sit here on my computer for 2 hours to go through them all.

Personally, I enjoy ranked and online matches as opposed to the other game modes.  If you are someone who likes to play an unselfish, pass-the-ball to the open player type game, forget about it.  Don't even bother buying 2k11.  The amount of turnovers in this game is ridiculous.  The last online game I played there was a combined 40+ turnovers in 5 minute quarters. And no, they weren't all committed by me. Even the most basic passes are contested and stolen despite the fact the defender has his back turned to the play.  I guess 2kSports did this to prevent those magical passes that somehow got through the lane in prior years games.  If you are one of them players that gets the ball to Lebron and does whatever they can to force your way into the lane, then this game's for you!The turnovers aren't the only problem in this game either.  It is also somewhat unrealistic.  My decision to sell the game was partially based on Raymond Felton dunking on Dwight Howard.  It was also based on the fact that 1 out of every 10 three point shots goes in, even with the best of shooters.  The shoot button in this game is extremely sensitive, maybe even more-so than the free throw controls.  My decision to sell 2k11 may have also been a result of the fact it is nearly impossible to connect to online matches.  I don't think I could have taken one more \"game session no longer available\" message.The positives to this game are those aspects other than the actual gameplay.  The arenas seem more real, especially Madison Square Garden and Staples Center.  MSG actually has the \"defense\" chant sound effect with the organ playing in the background.  The commentary also flows a lot better in this game than in prior years.Overall I am just disappointed for two reasons.  The first being that the one year 2k is terrible, NBA Elite decides to postpone their games' release.

My first year I crossed over to 2K was 2K9, then I screwed up and got 2K10 which was the same game with my player added, Live 10 should have been my purchase, but 24 was on the cover, 24 hypnotized me into a purchase.Anyway, this year we don't have a choice with Elite 11 tapping out.  After playing 2K11 for the first time last night I came to a quick conclusion, this is the best basketball game ever.

The one thing I'm REALLY DISSAPOINTED about, because I'm an older gamer, is the legend teams.  They made up bench players, total fictional players, and it's the same bench for every legend team except for the Bulls teams.  e.g smith, jones, garcia, heinz webster is the same bench that every legend team has!?!

I've found this the most engrossing way to play, and at times is a great deal of fun.Here's what I enjoy:You start out by creating a rookie, fresh out of college.  After playing through several scrimmages for scouts, you are drafted based on your performance.  I was drafted by the Memphis Grizzlies in the 1st round.  You'll then play some preseason games and complete drills in order to raise your abilities.  When you begin, your player is for the most part, terrible.  It's the points you're awarded in game and after drills that make all the difference.  You only control your player in the games, and have little control over what else is going on.  This is great when the coach is calling plays for you to participate in, but boring when not or when on the bench (which you can simulated through).Now to the problems that have me close to throwing my controller through the tv:Your in-game performance raises/lowers a letter-grade meter.  When the meter fills, you move up a letter grade and try to then raise it higher (A+ is the highest letter grade you can achieve in-game).  It's great when you're doing what the CPU decides is good, but frustrating when you're docked for \"allowing an inside pass\" (a pass anywhere in the paint, even if your opponents toe is at the top of the key), \"allowing your man to score\" (this is the NBA, nobody is unstoppable), and multiple other frustrating reasons.  Wide open layup made and you're awarded for \"good shot selection\", missed and you're docked for \"poor shot selection\".And speaking of wide open layups, this is the game's biggest flaw!  I'm now on the Lakers, and Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Fischer, Bynum, and Odum routinely miss shots directly under the basket while unguarded.  Just today I played a game where Bryant went 2-26 shooting.  This happens more often than not.  Your team is completely terrible.  And then there's Ron Artest, who will shoot from anywhere as long as he's across midcourt.  It wouldn't be so bad if your CPU opponent wasn't hindered by this same flaw.  They shoot the lights out, at times not missing shots for an entire quarter, and that's with defenders in their faces.I've had numerous occasions where Bryant or Fischer will cross midcourt and throw the ball backwards to me even though I have not called for a pass, resulting in backcourt violation and me getting docked for a turnover.  Offensive rebounds are very difficult to get.  You can move freely through the lane until one of your teammates throws up a prayer, then suddenly an extended arm thrust you backwards.  This compounds the frustration from all the poor shots and easy misses by your teammates.  Defenders are very sticky.  If you bump into one, you will get tangled and molested until you turbo out of their grasp.  At least once a game, I've tried to cut through the paint to follow the play called, bumped into a defender, and got hung up long enough to be called for a 3-second violation, which of course docks you for a turnover.Conclusion:This game makes me mad... very mad.  But it also is a lot of fun.  I can overlook the ridiculous CPU cheap shots just because I'm obsessed with making my player better.  With each game, I gain just a bit more talent (even though a 75 rating for \"shoot under basket\" and \"layup\" still only yields about a 25% success rate with layups!).  This game is difficult.  You can't just whip passes across the court or pull up with a defender near you.  It requires strategy and following the coach's playcalling.  Also, the difficulty and rules settings in the My Player mode cannot be altered.  I hate myself for loving this game.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Love/Hate Relationship", "unixReviewTime": 1292976000, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "A2T6MYD9VVPMEU", "asin": "B003IMGC9U", "reviewerName": "Persian Poetess", "helpful": [16, 18], "reviewText": "For ages basketball games have been hampered by the clunkiness of their execution, poor AI opponents, and being far from an homage to the fans.  NBA2k11 is the complete antithesis of all the above flaws.  Is it THE perfect basketball game?  No.  But it comes quite close!  Below you will find my thoughts on what was done awesomely as well as what was done poorly.WHAT WAS DONE RIGHT...Beautiful B-ballers:Though graphics do not necessarily make the game, NBA2k11 paints true to life avatars of some epic b-baller greats.  Bone structure, muscle tone, facial expressions...you name it!  Each is done with lots of care and precision.  Thankfully this attention to detail also translates well when it comes to the player animations too.  One teensy flaw in this category though is the animations for coaches and fans are much less impressive.  Where Kobe's court prowess comes off as smooth and silky, the Laker's coach comes off as robotic and rigid.  There's also the occasional muddiness or lack of aliasing woes in the PS3 version.  Regardless of the hiccups, the presentation is still a satisfying experience for whichever console you play on.Arena Atmosphere and Sounds:Everything about the arenas in this game make it feel as if you are in the midst of a fever pitched basketball game.  The crowd is far from a mass of 2 or 3 clones but rather very unique looking at all angles.  The cheer tracks do not sound canned and the excitement in the revelry rises when you score some sweet slam dunks or buzzer beater shots.  Your teammates and coaches will even get in on the action and give you approving fist pumps.  Besides the big picture stuff, even the little details will make you smile.  For example, you'll catch glimpses of the court janitor leaning on his mop as you prepare yourself for a free throw.  It's the tiny but thoughtful stuff like this that really adds realism to the game to me.Great and Fluid Control:Dribbling feels as natural as it would in real life.  Nudging the controller in a rhythmic left to right or quickly backpedaling it feels flawless.  Initiating plays through the D-pad is a pretty easy procedure too and won't halt the gameplay a second.  Shooting is one stumbling block for beginners but once you get your timing and placing down it couldn't be easier.  Things may be tough to grasp at first but once you learn to do effective passing rhythms and not to spam square to steal, you'll really start to enjoy how the mechanics of this game work.My Player...Create a Pro the Real Way:My Player is really one of the most satisfying career components I have ever played in a sports game.  Not only do you get to personalize an athlete but you really get to create a legitimate reputation for him based on his actions later down the line.  While some criticize My Player as feeling too dragged and long, I feel that the length of time to really see your Pro bloom is just right.  It honestly is more fun to build up a player from nothing and use your skills to nudge him up to bigger and better things.  If I wanted a Pro right from the get-go, I'd have just fired up a game with the Bulls and MJ!WHAT WAS DONE WRONG...Tedious and Buried Menus:Though I understand how feature rich this game is, digging around the menus to find a certain feature is no fun.  At first I wasn't even sure if the menus existed until I inadvertently pressed the analog stick.  I'd much rather prefer that the popular game modes to be right at the front and the smaller features stored in other menus.  The good thing is though, if you do not wish to go into Association play or the MJ challenges just yet, there's the ever easy Quick Game option right on the first screen.The Move Doesn't Move Me:I am quite underwhelmed with how the Move was executed in NBA2k11.  The controls are responsive enough but I dislike all the different button configurations you need to remember while doing gestures (if I wanted more buttons I'd stick with the Dualshock).  Plus what happens on the screen does not mimic your movements but rather executes a pre-programmed animation.  One of the biggest thorns is the fact that the navigational controller is NOT recognized by the game.  This means you are stuck with uncomfortably holding the Dualshock controller in your other hand.  Hopefully 2k will patch the navigational controller in at a later time but at the moment it looks quite unlikely.  Ironically the one thing the Move does incredibly well in NBA2k11 is shooting.  I timed my freethrows way easier by lifting my move controller in a throwing motion than I did with the analog stick.All in all, NBA2k11 is the sports game to beat this year, perhaps even for the next five years.  It is a classic in the making and the future of sports gaming all in one.  Hopefully competitors can take note of 2k's efforts and up the ante for their future sports offerings to come.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "NBA2k11 Scores a Slam Dunk!

When I fired this up and played the initial Bulls Lakers playoff game the controls were letting me down. My release on the button was a little off as I tried to get a handle on how to switch players, steal, and block.  Then I switched to move controls and the natural rhythms of raise and shoot movement, wrist flicking steals, and up movement blocks that I had mastered from countless Wii basketball games came into play.  The complex controls of the Dual shock scheme gave way to a much more natural game with the depth of control still mostly there, including an incredibly natural free throw feel. However HOLDING THE DUALSHOCK in your left hand for player movement instead of THE NAV CONTROLLER (which is just not getting the support it deserves in any title) starts to hurt your wrist.  Even as a Knicks/Sonics admirer I love the Bulls era Jordan teams and playing as the exalted one himself not to mention all of the classic squads.  There are so many modes here it is silly and the polish in the menus, music, sfx are great.  I think this is a more accessible NBA title with all the depth, strategy, and complexity there if die hards want to exploit it.  The slider and gameplay options make it a very customizable game if you just play with the settings.

I played a lot of basketball games when I was young, all the ones like Double Dribble, Jordan versus Bird, Tecmo Basketball. I loved Basketball, loved watching the NBA and playing all the video games. Over the years, I lost interest in the NBA as all the great players left the game. Back in the day when Jordan played, teams were stacked with pure talent, even on their bench, it was the golden age of Basketball. I saw Jordan on the cover of the game and I knew I had to get it. They paid respect to a legend in Basketball by putting him on the cover, I knew then the company that made this had some love for the game of basketball. It was worth getting to me.The gameplay in this game is the best ever I have played in a basketball game, it beats out all the old games I played when I was young. It is the best basketball game ever put out on the market. Several reviewers before me mention how great the gameplay is, I would just echo it. I have to play real basketball and I have to look for bad passes, I have to look for bad shots. The ball will get stolen or blocked if I don't. I have never played a basketball game like this, I have to actually think while playing. There's a lot of sliders in the game to make almost every little detail harder or easier, fit to my liking, I absolutely love this feature. I can fine tune the game in every detail to make it challenging and very realistic, even to fit my not very good skill level.Most of all, this game is FUN! Even for non-NBA fans, I bet they would love this game too.THE GOOD:It's on PC!Not only does the game look better on PC, but you can get Mods for it! Check out the official forum, there is a sticky with links for Mods in it. You can make the game look even better than it already does with graphic mods, you can get missing portraits, get better shoes, get different balls, get better courts, change the teams into college teams... the list goes on! Only can you do this on the PC.A lot of controllers work with the game! I have tried 7 year old controllers with the game and they work perfect with it. There's no guarantee that your controller would work with it too, but if all my old controllers work for it, controller support for this game must be good. You do not need an XBOX controller to play it! They put the XBOX controller all over the manual for this game, but it's not needed to play.THE BAD:All custom made players and random generated players look the same!I am not knocking the players already made, they look fantastic! All the players in the NBA are made with detail in this game. What I am talking about, are the rookies generated in Association mode and the players you try to make. When playing in Association mode, rookies are generated at the beginning of each year for the draft. They all tend to look the exact same. A white guy looks like a black guy! Imagine a lot of black albinos in the NBA... that's what the NBA looks like in the Association mode I am playing with now. I am playing against black albinos. A black wth an afro looks just like a white/black albino with red hair. They really need to make the random created guys look more unique, because this is really annoying. The players I try to make myself look the same. I try to make a white player, but all I get are black features to work with. There are sliders to play around with to make a more detailed face, but lets face it, a lot of people aren't good with these, including myself.Because I only really enjoy playing the Association mode, this is a big minus for me in this game.One final note, get the patch for the game. It's a great patch! Sometimes patches for games are lame, don't do much, break the game, etc... but this is one of the good ones.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Got me back into Basketball, Get the Patch", "unixReviewTime": 1298937600, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2011"}

I was not disappointed, and I enjoyed this game just as much as the first.  The gameplay and style are exactly the same as the first game, but the sequel offers new cases.  For those unfamiliar with the series, this is primarily a hidden object game, punctuated by logic-style puzzles at the end of each chapter.  The game features a series of Sherlock Holmes cases, and you must search a variety of locations to find clues to solve the mystery.  Each location reveals a number of potential suspects, and the conclusion involves solving a logic and memory puzzle to determine which party is guilty.  The cases are well-written, and the hidden object scenes are appropriate to the time and place in question (late-19th c. London).  The suspects are believable, and the objects one must find to discover suspects are appropriate to the story (perfume bottles for the mistress of a prominent politician, for example).

I may be in the minority here, because I just don't find the game that fun...  Here's why:So it plays very much like Zelda Ocarina, in that you have a camera behind you and you move about in a slightly overhead 3/4 view.  The field, towns, and characters all have that Zelda feel.  You use the d-pad to move.  The graphics are pretty amazing, though not really detailed.  They have a painted look which is quite in keeping with the theme.  The music is catchy, but seems to really focus on one or two themes.  Yes, I know it is trying to capture the sound of feudal and ancient Japan, but I listen to a lot of Koto and Shamisen music which is beautiful very diverse... this game's score really isn't.There are puzzles which are not really challenging, more annoyances.  They typically involve 'trace this object' or 'get the boy off the wolf and make him walk over the shaky bridge for a switch'.  Not really my kind of puzzles.  I prefer the challenges that require thinking and problem solving... like Lufia 2 (SNES) or Final Fantasy Echoes of Time (DS).The battles are pretty ordinary, and attacks consist of tapping a button a few times, or maybe using the stylus for a special attack.  Of course you have to 'switch' to the drawing screen to do this, which pauses the action... It would have been nice to be able to hit these moves on the fly and possibly build them into combos.  Also of annoyance is that most battles involve a special 'battle area' so you get warped off the main field and into a circular room to do battle.  I would have liked all of the battles to take place in the field so that the real time feel is maintained.  Some little enemies run around the field, but they are pretty minor.Also, you spend so much time, especially early on, merely running from place to place, that you rarely fight anything.  The game involves more of the talking and running errand style than actually getting out and beating the crap out of baddies.  Which is one area where Zelda kicks serious butt.The story is based on Japanese myth and lore, though it seems they based this game on the characters from the myths and not the actual myths (look up Amaterasu or Susano-O or Orochi).  But it is a rather interesting and fun story line with some interesting characters.  I kind of liked the weird mumbling voice that everyone makes when speaking.Overall I think the game needs vast improvement, but it is a nice game with a fun story line that merely fell short on execution.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It's inventive, but truly fun?", "unixReviewTime": 1316044800, "reviewTime": "09 15, 2011"}
{"reviewerID": "A3DAGPIW9GVK2B", "asin": "B003IOGPAO", "reviewerName": "CisforCorgi", "helpful": [99, 105], "reviewText": "I realize I'm writing this review fairly soon, but I got my copy a few days ago at Gamestop and I wanted to put this up as soon as possible to sway potential fence-sitters. This is a great series, and I'm desperately hoping that with more attention capcom will pay it the attention it deserves. So I feel like it's my duty as a fan to get the message out about the game to get more people who might have been unsure to give it a try. I'm going to keep this as spoiler free as possible and focus on the game itself. :) I'm at the last boss of the game right now, so I'm far enough to make a fair judgment on the game and its mechanics.To start, let me say that this game is not without its flaws. However, it plays beautifully and I feel that it is a great sequel to the masterpiece that was the original Okami game. The celestial brush and the stylus combo of the DS work wonderfully together, and it really does feel like you're the one summoning the divine winds. Now, on to the positives:Pros:-Fantastic storyline, but it's Okami so you have to expect that. There are enough twists and deep backstory to keep a player quite interested until the end and beyond.-I cannot fully describe how adorable this game is. Chibiterasu is about the cutest thing since baby kittens rolling around in baby bunnies. There were points of the game where I just melted at the sheer adorableness of it all. Don't let that fool you though, the plot is anything but childlike.-The visuals for a DS game are A+. They really put their all into make a functional, pretty, stylized game for the DS and I'm glad the DS got a good hurrah before the 3DS comes out. The sumi-e style artwork is back, and though it's much less detailed than the original game, it still works. The characters all generally look the same, the only thing you'll notice is that it's slightly less detailed and a little more pixely in some places, but meh.-The celestial brush and the DS touchscreen just click. It's the perfect medium for a game like this. And can I just say that doing the inferno move on the DS is 50 times easier than trying to make an infinity symbol using the wii remote.-Recognizable characters from the first game. This is a continuation of the story, so you get to see your favorites come back. It's hard not to spoil anything, but you will see characters you know and love continuing their stories.-This game ties up a lot of the plot and explains a TON of things from the first game. You get to see things as they happen and you'll have a lot of, \"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! So that's why!\" moments.-Can I just mention the story again? It's too good not to mention twice. The game starts off fairly slow, but as you get further in and start visiting familiar locales from the first game, it gets surprisingly deep. There are multiple main characters teaming up with Chibiterasu, and you WILL get tied up in their backstories and storylines to the point of being anxious to see what happens next. There were a few times the game brought tears to my eyes, much like the first one. I'm honestly scared to watch the ending lest I bawl like a baby.-The music is good. A lot of it was imported from the first game, which I will not complain about.-Praise Amaterasu, they removed that stupid freakin' digging game. I will not miss you, you exercise in frustration you.-More things to collect like Issun's masterpieces, history scrolls, etc. Collecting them is much easier than collecting the beads in the first game. I've managed to complete all the collections in my first playthrough and I'm far from a completionist.-A new system with regards to the multiple partners you get. Each one has a special ability and most of the dungeons involve several puzzles revolving around them.-A neat little sidequest involving recruiting villagers for a village that develops as you play.This game is so, so good. I cannot emphasize this enough. There's too many positives to list here. However, I'll do my part as a reviewer and list the flaws as well, both for people to be prepared for the frustration and in the off chance a capcom employee reads this so they know what to fix in the next games. (lol I wish, right?)-This game obviously pushes the limits of the DS hardware to the point where if too many things are going on onscreen, the game will visibly lag. It's not TOO terrible and does NOT inhibit the gameplay, but it was definitely noticeable.-The game is very linear. For example, you cannot jump in bodies of water, and there are loading portals at every bend. There is much less free-form exploration, but it's still there. Just not to the extent that it was on the wii. However, you do lose a sense of that open space freedom that you got from running through the fields with Ammy in the first game.-They chibi-ized almost everything except most of the main adult NPCs. Imagine my dismay to see the noble canine-warriors looking like stuffed animals. Hrm.-There are so many more dungeons and boss fights. Thankfully the dungeons are short, but you will find yourself spending more time in them than you did exploring like in the original Okami. There are also on screen monsters (that don't port you into the fighting arena thing) that you bap with your reflector to kill while completing puzzles, a lot like zelda. I'm not sure if that is a pro or a con, but it is way different than the first game.-They removed some of the celestial gods from the original Okami and added new ones. The new ones could be considered a pro, but I was a little sad to know they took out some of my favorites in favor of new skills that I found particularly gimmicky and blah. The old saying of, \"Don't mess with a good thing\" comes to mind, but I can totally understand if other people don't agree with me on this one. This flaw is mainly my own opinion as a fan.-The puzzles with the partners got old after a while. They're a main focus of the game since a lot of the platforming is removed, so be prepared for it. This game is far more puzzle oriented than its parent title.-The controls are not so great, I'm sad to say. Movement is slow and blocky due to the DS controls. You'll find yourself needing to turn quickly or whatever else and Chibiterasu is apparently just not a good acrobat. This does make things very frustrating at certain points, but it's certainly not a gamekiller.-The few platforming areas in the game are frustrating due to the bad controls. It's hard to dodge or accurately jump to a platform if you can't move quickly enough thanks to the controlscheme.-Combat is not so great either. It's hard to believe it's a step down from the previous game, but it is. The arena is much smaller, and a lot of times they stick 2 or 3 projectile wielding enemies in this small area with you. It's hard not to get hit, especially since you can't move or jump mid-swing. Thankfully they decreased the threshold of how much damage knocks down your damage rating at the end of the battle.-Some of the bosses are absolutely maddening. They give you very little explanation as to what you need to do until usually about halfway into the boss fight, so you go into it blindly and hope for the best. Problem is, if you don't do the special gimmick of the fight when the boss is stunned, the boss heals. Almost all of the bosses heal in this game. Be prepared for that.-They added an underwater sidescrolling section like the old Mario games where the screen automatically scrolls to the right. Why did they do this? I have no idea. It was my least favorite part of the game. TO top it off, they added a boss there as well. Salt in the wound.-On one playthrough of the game I got enough praise to max out Chibi's health and ink pots. With this, and the fact that I got all the collectables, I have little reason to play through the game again. Thankfully I like the plot, so I will.-Unfortunately there are a lot of plot retcons, holes, and inconsistences that anyone who paid attention to the first game are going to notice right of the freakin' bat. One in particular bothered me a lot, but I'll leave that to you guys to find out. I can't go into more detail without spoiling things.-Since there are a lot of familiar aspects of the first game, you'll find yourself saying, \"Really? Again?\" more than a few times during the game.-Anybody who hasn't played the first game probably isn't going to get the full enjoyment out of the game since it relies so heavily on plots and characters from Okami. It will give you backstory, but a lot of the joy comes in going, \"So that's what happened to that character!\" and seeing little nods and easter eggs from the first game popping up all over the place. It's still worth playing, but I'd highly recommend playing Okami first.-Ink pots no longer automatically refill. You get used to this, but it still bugged me as I played through the game. Especially since, like Ammy, Chibi loses his powers if he uses all his inkpots. But unless you have an items to regain the ink, you stay that way since the ink pots don't refill.Okay, whew. Don't let the amount of flaws fool you. I only listed as many as I could think of so that people would know. The fact of the matter is that the pros FAR outweigh the flaws. It should be obvious since despite the obnoxious platforming in some areas, I KEPT PLAYING because I wanted to see what happened next in the story.If you are a fan of okami or heck, games with deeply interwoven storylines and fun mechanics, I HIGHLY recommend this game. I have not been able to put it down since I got it on Friday. What are you doing still reading this?

You play as Amaterasu's son in this true sequel to the hit classic Okami for PS2. There was a lot of speculation that the game would be dumbed down or just feature mini-games, but we get a full-fledged 20 hour adventure on par to the first game. You wander around the world of Nippon (Japan) trying to stop an evil spirit named Akuro from bringing the world into darkness. Along the way you meet 5 children that become your partners and help you learn new brush techniques.The game feels like it suits the DS better than the PS2 thanks to the touch screen. The game is also almost exactly like Okami in a way so we get a console experience on a handheld and that's rare for the DS. This also becomes a major problem because it is too similar to Okami to become truly unique which is what prevents it from a higher score (or Editor's Choice). The combat is similar to Okami in that you are trapped in a giant circle and you fight that way. Instead of adding new things to the combat or re-inventing it you fight just like Okami. Using your weapon and brush technique you whack away, but each enemy needs a strategy because they have elemental powers, or some are immune unless stunned. The enemies are unique, but the combat lacks any change and vets will feel the combat isn't as fun the second time around and you will avoid it as much as possible. Boss fights are really epic and each use the brush techniques in a unique way just like Okami did. These are some of the best parts of the game.Puzzles were a big thing in Okami using the Celestial Brush, but this time around they feel easy and lack any real challenge. Guiding your partner across a gap to fetch something isn't very hard. Even just using a brush technique to open a door or find a way out isn't exactly challenging either, but they feel Zelda like so fans of that series will like this. Even though each dungeon offers new brush techniques and new elemental powers, they are used in the same mundane way throughout the whole game, but they are easy so you don't have to expect frustration.Outside of combat and solving puzzles the exploring of the world is a little mundane as well. Finding secrets was big in Okami, but it just feels tiresome here because there is no big pay off for finding all secrets, or even finding any that are used as cash at shops or just items. I wanted to find a super powerful weapon, maybe a hidden brush technique, but instead we just get normal stuff. I really wish there was more to whole game then just finding your way to the next dungeon, but there are side quests for people who are into that. You don't get anything but praise which levels you up which in turn gives you more life and ink pots. Everything that you did in Okami can give you praise here, but nothing new added yet again.Besides this the controls are tight with the shoulder buttons acting as the brush ability which brings a snapshot of the top screen to the bottom. Brush strokes feel natural using the touch screen, but some times if the camera is off the stroke won't register or will do a different one which left me frustrated a few times. Using the D-pad to control Chibi is a bit rough because it is so small (using the 3DS circle pad is a life saver), but overall the controls work well. I did find the map completely useless because it is either too big or too small and there's no way to zoom around on it. I also found myself completely lost on where to go due to a lack of some sort of quest log or journal.The best part about Okamiden is the unique art style that Okami brought to gamers, and despite the DS's ancient hardware it sucks every bit of power to pull this off. This results in some serious slow down quite often, but the game looks great. My last complaint would be that the game is long-winded towards the end and isn't suited for portable play. Save points are spread too far apart and it feels like a console game even on this. 20 hours is also a bit long for a handheld, but in turn we get a wonderfully crafted story with a lot detail and characters you really care for.Okamiden does a lot right by bringing the unique experience of Okami to the DS with console quality style, but in turn doesn't do enough things that are new to make it as amazing, or as unique, as the original was. Everybody who owns a DS should play this game because it is one of the best on the little system. Even with ancient hardware Okamiden shows us exactly what this system was built for.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A unique experience on the DS, but retreads too much of the original", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2012"}

But if you're looking for in-depth info on a game, I highly suggest you google \"IGN, review, Okamiden\" and read that. Or \"Gametrailers, video review, Okamiden\" and watch their video review. I don't like to break down how a game plays, or what the mechanics are, or details of the story, etc. :)I will say this though; this is one of the most stunningly beautiful DS games ever made. Considering the original game was for PS2 and Wii, crushing it down to the DS (much weaker hardware) is an achievement. Sure they use tricks like splitting up larger landmasses by \"portals\", but a whole world is here and that's impressive. And it's fully 3D with a smart camera, not like the DS Zelda games, with their top-down, technically 2D gameplay. It's very impressive technically, and artistically, the game's \"Ukiyo-e\" (I think that's the word) art style is still here, in full force. It's a beautiful game any way you look at it, and the main characters - all sons or daughters of characters from the first game - are adorable:)The game is a meaty adventure as well, with tons of people to talk to, quests to go on, puzzles to solve, abilities to gain, and bosses to conquer. A package like this would be a must own on a console or a PC, but on a handheld, it should be treasured. It's seriously staggering how much content is piled into this DS cart. I thought no game would come close to being as impressive a package as Dragon Quest IX, but Capcom seemingly knows as much about the DS hardware as Level 5 does for that game. Or Nintendo themselves.Oh, and of course, the touch screen is the IDEAL interface for the Okami series' signature \"Celestial Brush\" mechanic. Obviously. It's hard to go back to the also-excellent Wii game after this, to be honest.If you want a great DS game, just buy Okamiden. There's nothing here that a gamer won't love. Visually, it's stunning. Musically, it's beautiful. And the epic adventure you go on has a great story, and strong gameplay. Pokemon and Monster Tale are also great, but technically, they're nothing compared to what Okamiden is making the DS hardware do. THIS is easily Game of the Year for the DS currently, and I can't imagine anything dethroning it now that the 3DS is out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than the first", "unixReviewTime": 1303603200, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2011"}

I lucked into this Limited Edition at the low price of $27.99 with Prime shipping, otherwise I'd never have bought it; I'm mostly over the urge to get 'extras' with my games at this point since I'm running out of storage room. I confess I haven't broken the seal on the special stuff, though that's mostly because I didn't want to damage any of it accidentally. The extras are neat to have in my collection though.I also didn't buy this intending to play it online and probably won't ever, since everyone else is playing Halo 4 right now anyway. Nope, I actually had this for months before breaking it out finally since I have been pretty busy. This week however I was sick and playing Xbox was about the only thing I felt like doing, so out it came. And man, what a great time I had with it.A little background hopefully without spoiling the story: Reach takes place before the original Halo games. Most probably know what the deal is but I won't address that, I'll just say you're not going to play Master Chief here. Nope, you get to choose a mysterious new Spartan addition to Noble Team. I chose the female because I thought it was neat to have that as a choice for once. 'Noble Six' is similar to the Master Chief in that he or she lacks a name or much in the way of background other than hints in the dialogue. I however am drawn to the opportunity to fill in the blanks in my mind, though I suppose not everyone feels that way.When the original Halo was released, I worked at a certain national video game retail chain, and one of the freebies we got was the first Halo-branded novel by Eric Nylund - again don't want to spoil things, so you can look it up if you're interested. Normally I hate serialized fiction, but I honestly loved that book, and knowing the basic back story made me anticipate this game more. When well executed, as I feel Reach and the novel were, I really enjoy finding out other details of a given 'universe' in fiction.One thing I read in other reviews was that players didn't feel any emotional connection to the other Noble Team members, but I certainly did for most of them.Another complaint was that the game got rid of some fancy toys from Halo 2 & 3 - my response to that is again, this game takes place FIRST. Yes it would have been 'cool', but honestly playing this game felt incredibly similar to my first time playing through the original Halo on the original Xbox. It was a little simpler in terms of controls/weapons/vehicles than 2 & 3, and I enjoyed the return to the 'roots' of the gameplay. The same person also complained it was too linear - while I haven't played those in several years, again Reach feels like the original Halo and I found that other than the Noble members telling you to hurry up with the objective, you could easily run around the edges of the environments and explore for a while.My first time through was on 'easy' because I wasn't sure how hard it would be and I just wanted to get through it. That took me about 9 hours or so, not super long but IIRC, about the same length as Halo 2 was. I've started a 'normal' game now that I feel like my skills are a little more honed, and it's nice knowing where some of the more powerful weapons are hiding. No idea how long that will take since I am in school, but I will probably finish it at least once more.Overall I really enjoyed this; I love the series and while online matches are awesome, my time is more limited now so it was nice having a solid campaign to fall back on.

The release of ROTGS is the offical trumpet call for anyone who was waiting to try AOC. Conan is now ready.The DX10 graphics are amazing and much streamlined. The alternate advancement system works well and was a brilliant move to keep old world content from being outdated. The music is probably the best soundtrack in any MMORPG ever.

Yes if youre running on Vista or 7 32 bit youll prolly experience memory problems. But as a vista 32 bit user myself I found this link that helped me with my memory situation;[...]I know it wont fix everyone's problems if they experience any but thats worth a try along with updating graphics drivers. Those are a couple of things that I found really helped with my stabilty in game and the last couple of patches have optimized the epansion areas.But overall as a consumer I am really impressed with the leaps and strides Funcom has made with the expansion.  The new areas are lavishly detailed and rendered wonderfully.  The end level areas are vast and open different challenges.  If you think you can go in there without being properly geared or skilled by youself think again.  This is what I really like about this new expansion, it offers more of a challenge and the six man dungeons offer tons of entertainment and have a Godslayer mode that offers even better rewards.Even though there isnt new levels the Alternate Advancment System offers new talents, perks, and abilities that can now diverisfy different players and their skills.  It can be a bit of a grind but this is what they are doing instead of new levels.  In my opinion its the same premise as getting new levels and is still a way to progress your already  maxed out character.  From a PVPer's perspective though, this is probably the only thing thats been added to cater to the pvp side of the game.  But even though its the only thing its a pretty big addition.Now the game has factions along with a new race, there are about twelve factions and you can join a total of seven. With each faction comes different quests for the areas and dungeons that offer faction points that reward you with tokens and faction levels that offer you new gear.  This can offer a lot of depth as who you want to join, some factions may give you the armor you want, but another might have a mount or pet or weapon youd like just as much.  Theres even a betrayl system implemented that lets you backstab your faction to join an opposing one. Be careful though, this wont let you switch on the fly and requires a lot of work.I do not consider myself a jaded gamer and this game isn't perfect, but I dont find this expansion \"grindy\" in the slightest. It is what you make of it, you can grind the same quests if you want like i tried, but as I did that my friends were out exploring doing different dungeons and quests that I was missing.  Theres plenty to do without feeling tedious, but again thats up to the player and his or her guild.  But there are flaws, one obvious one is the above stated memory problem for 32 bit users, I and many others have found solutions to fix our problems but the game still needs to look into that.  Also a major PVPer myself I find this expansion not catering much to the pvpers, though the patches prior to the expansion did add extra PVP levels and gear.Aside from the few problems I am loving this expansion and am definitly getting my money's worth. This game is not AION or WoW, so if youre coming from there and expecting the same you might want to change your mindset to enjoy the game.  Different doesnt always mean bad :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Rise of a great expansion", "unixReviewTime": 1275350400, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2010"}

The feel of it was excellent, the look was great, and it was superb for playing games on my PC. That was until later. I really wanted to love this controller, I really did. It just wouldn't be justified for me to review it positively though. After about a month of use on my Xbox, it would start going wonky and require the person using it to go up and unplug it to reset it. While it was a minor annoyance, it was something I could live with. Considering I have two other MS controllers, I rarely used it anyways so that wasn't a problem.The main reason I purchased it was for gaming on my PC. I prefer the feel of the Xbox controller to any I've ever used in the past. I got it on sale in a store for about $20 and thought that it was a great price, especially when compared to an OEM wired controller. The afterglow was a nice addition, but price was my primary reason for buying it. Often times my controller would just stop working during a game and it would require me to exit the game and start it back up again. That was a major headache, but again, it was something that I could live with. Just today, about six months after buying it, my controller has just totally went out. It takes six or seven tries to get it working, and when it does, it only works for about 5-10 minutes. The lights will start flashing for no reason, the vibration goes static (keeps spinning over and over again despite not even playing the game) and Windows reports no driver failures (indicating that it is hardware based).All in all, I had fun with the controller when it worked. It was especially sturdy (considering how much it failed on an interior level), it was responsive, and the lights did look cool. That said, I can't recommend this to anyone.

Bad and good. I did tons of research for a few days, online reviews to written reviews.Yesterday, I set off to buy this controller from Gamestop and not Amazon \"Because I feel the chance of getting it straight from the seller i.e. Gamestop/Walmart/Best Buy without it shipping and possibly getting a damaged or a broken controller is very low\".So I asked the guy about returns blah blah blah, I get a 30 day return policy via new accessories so just in case. I came home and took it out of the tough packaging \"Yes it's tough, It's unstealable\" and then plugged it in.Let me say first that I'm no stranger to the Xbox controller, I've used the Xbox controller a good portion of the 7 years as well as the PlayStation controller. This Afterglow controller is roughly 10-15% smaller than the Original 360 controller. The \"Select & Start\" buttons are diagonal at the top of the controller above the big X. Second, I wasn't expecting it to be this bright, wow this sucker is bright.* The ControllerThe Controller.. Feels great, awesome resistance from the analogs and the buttons work fine as well as the D-Pad.I first tried this off in a Emulator, worked fine with 0% issues. All buttons are hard and work excellent. However.. I put on Left 4 Dead 2 for the \"Test\" everyone has dreaded before they bought this, is the right analog really that horrible?!To put it right, No. Honestly, it's completely fine. At first I had some trouble with it, it kinda feels like I'm using a One-Dimensional cross-hair, you go up, down, left, right. Feels as though you miss the entire 360 fully rotational analog we usually are use to. However, it seems after some test runs and re-calibrating the controller AND breaking it in, it seems to work alot better than out of the box. Is it great? No not at all, is it something you can use for FPS games? That's hard to answer, after using it for quite awhile the rotation got alot better. It could be fact you need to break in the rotation.I bought this as a Pc Joystick replacement as my previous Joystick is about to bite the dust. I wanted something sleek, like a game console Joystick and in-expensive. This was my offer.* The Good- LED Lights, perfect for night gaming. \"Can easily turn them off too\"- Small, lightweight and a decent cord length.- Clear coating, easy to detect malfunctions etc.- Buttons work fantastic.- Plugs right in and you're ready to play, no software.* The Ugly- Right Analog stick could be better out of the box. \"100% still playable though\"- LED's are too bright sometimes.- Little too small for taste.- X \"Guide\" button is a knockoff. Maybe for legal reasons (Shrugs)?* Verdict?..Well, if you want a Pc Joystick and aren't strapped to the balls with Cash then this might work for you.7.5/10, the right analogs knocks it off 2 points while being slightly over-small \"For me\" takes the 0.5. Maybe the analog will get better after some wear & tear. I didn't really buy it for New Generation games anyway. This was really a strictly bought Joystick for Emulators as the New Generation games are a bonus.* Should YOU get it?Depends on the person honestly, if you're a core gamer and you just enjoy playing game then this controller is most likely for you. I considered myself a relaxed gamer. If you're a hardcore \"Underground\" player (FPS) Mainly, then I'd probably skip this one unless the analog wouldn't bother you. For 32.47$ at Gamestop it's better than paying 59.99$ for an official controller. The LED's \"Various Colors\" to choose from, are really nice for nighttime gaming and the Small architecture \"even though complained about\" can fit in more places for cover.It's up to you, a real review from a real gamer who wants to help other people out.P.s. If you can buy this from a Local Best Buy or Gamestop, buy it from there. Just take assurance out that it should be working and didn't get banged around or mistreated where you bought it online.******UPDATE******I still have the controller and it IS still working just fine. However the Directional Pad seems to have messed up or become damaged in some what. Buttons are really loose now or at least 'A and B' are anyway. Both analogs are broken in and still work fine. Both have the Dead Stick thing going on. The right analog is still the same, kinda hard in FPS games but nonetheless still works. It has fallen off high things and has been crushed lightly while slightly being mistreated.

They can stay light at all times, only light when the controller vibrates, or can be turned off all together. Cord is pretty long.Cons: Plastic that the controller is made out of can make hands very clammy and sweaty. More then normal controllers would. These are not wireless controllers. The texting chat pads do NOT fit with these.My main complaints are as follows. Right out of the box, the LED light closest to the RB button would blink when the RB button would be pressed. Nothing that effects gameplay, but this kind of shows how cheap these things are made. It's not suppose to happen.3 weeks of owning the controller, the very touchy, sensitive, and accurate analog sticks started giving me issues. Brand new, they are amazing. But 3 weeks in, my right analog stick would become almost unresponsive. At times, I wouldn't even touch it, and it would action as if I was pushing it like crazy. Example, in my Left 4 Dead first person shooter, the right stick is your aim. I would not be touching it, Ans I would see my crossairs slowly moving down. Then they would shot straight up. I found un-plugging the controller and plugging it back in fixed it, but only temporarily. Became very annoying.The rubber thumb grips on the analog sticks are also junk. 4 weeks in, there where black shavings all inside the controller. Almost like pencil eraser shavings. The left stick's rubber grub got so warn down, the very slick bare analog stick would cause my thumb to hurt, and it was very slick to where my thumb would slip off.All in all, good controller out of the box, but not built to last.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not built to last...", "unixReviewTime": 1300838400, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2011"}

They're just too bright. I realize I purchased a led lit controller and I'd be annoyed if they were dim, but jeepers, there's bright and then there's Afterglow controller bright. But, as I said, I wanted a led lit controller... How bright or dim should they be? Who decides? I feel a brightness level select would have been nice, but sadly non exists. So let this be a warning... This controller is BRIGHT!Of course you can toggle them off, or have them only flash when the game is causing the controller to vibrate which is a nice touch.2) My second gripe has been mentioned in other reviews. And that's the feel of this controller is not consistent with the stock MS one. The throw of the analogue sticks is further and this has led to a need for retraining when playing FPS games.So the controller is bad right? No, and that's why it's a tough review. After a few evenings' play I got used to the new feel of the sticks and my skill climbed back to what it was. I actually think I prefer the extended distance and will continue to use the controller for my FPSing.Everything else is fine; the feel of the plastic, the position of the buttons and solidity of the triggers is great.

I'm an adult male who likes to play children's game as well as adult-level games, but I had a hard time enjoying this one.What it is; is the Rudolph story (just like on TV) told to you on the DS. As the story progresses, either Santa or the Snowman asks you to participate in certain activities to get to the next part of the story. These activities are like: brushing a reindeer's teeth, or coloring a picture, or decorating a scene with Christmas ornaments.Besides the main Rudolph story, the cartridge gives you another three mini side-stories you can read afterwards. The stories unlock one at a time, so you are forced to read them in order. Each story lasts between an hour or two.There are no real challenges within the activities, and challenges ARE what make a game a game. Hence, I cannot call this a game.You can either read a book to your kids in bed, or you can read the story to them on your Nintendo DS; while showing them how to brush a reindeer's teeth.

You also have a choice of characters to play as: Rudolph; Hermey; Yukon Cornelius; Santa Claus; Clarice.Games:Holiday Helper: One of Santa's elves tosses ornaments, light bulbs, presents, and misfit toys and you have to try to \"bounce\" these to either the undecorated tree or into Santa's bag. This is probably the most challenging game in the collection and a good way for young children to learn hand/eye coordination.Toy Making: Unpainted toys appear across the screen. When they glow you point the Wii remote at them to \"paint\" them. No skills are needed here outside of the ability to flick the Wii remote; you never really paint anything.Cookie Cutting: Help elves make Christmas cookies by rolling the dough, cutting the cookies, and baking them. Outside of moving the remote up and down and back and forth there is nothing to this game. No skill is needed; you never actually decorate the cookies.Saving Christmas: Santa drives his sleigh and you help him by tossing toys on the roofs of houses (extra points if a toy lands in the chimney). There is a bit more skill involved in this game as you try to aim for the chimney.\"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\" is a disappointing game in so many ways. While I realize I'm not the target audience or age group, the entire game takes 10 - 15 to play which is far too short even for children. All of the games are timed and you never get extra time even if you score a lot of points (and if you don't score any points you don't get a do-over, the game simply moves on). While the game is hosted by the annoyingly voiced Sam the Snowman and some of the characters from the TV special show up (often in the background) there is no real connection to the TV special (even the music isn't from the show).

There was even a rap Karaoke game. Well, I am glad to say they finally did it right!Basically, this is a Singstar/Lips (or whatever karaoke game you play) that focuses mainly on the \"Rap\" Genre. This includes a whole array of music, that spans generations, regions, and styles. Basically there is something for everyone here if you are a fan of \"Rap\". The system actually works, and it actually works VERY well. It not only matches your timing (whether or not you say the lyrics at the right time) but it actually checks to see if you say the right lyrics. Not only that, it sees if your pitch matches that of the singer (assuming there is singing in the song).In all, the game works pretty well!Better than you would imagine. But if you don't know the words to the song, you probably aren't going to pass the song.The Career Mode is slightly fun, but extremely short.Party Mode jumps you right into the actionFreestyle mode allows you and your friends to JUST  HAVE FUN!Song List:The song is is diverse, but is mainly the top songs over a 20 year period. So some of which you will know and love! Some of which you \"know\" but aren't 100% sure of what the words are. The song list is pretty solid, and the DLC is pretty great. To top it off, every song comes with its own music video, so the song feels complete. Granted, every song is the Tv release of the song (at the time), so every song is censored for MTV audiences.PROS::This game is tons of fun if you don't mind doing Hip-Hop/Rap karaoke. If you are into this sort of music, then this game is right up your alley. The DLC is good, and allows you to pick songs that YOU know and love. This includes older and newer music.CONS::Although the game works, some modes could be improved. There should just be a mode that allows you to put the songs on random, and just watch the videos. Also, you should be more customization  options. Career mode, just feels like something to make the game feel more complete, but definitely lacking. Also, the online experience could be improved greatly. Although this game works well, it feels like there are lots of little aspects that could be improved.CONCLUSION::If you've always loved rap and hip-hop, You will love this game.

Actual music videos back each track. There's a practice mode that lets you pick which verses you want to rap. And the game does a good job of covering a wide range of artists.

There are other songs you can purchase on the PSN, but that's still adding to the cost here. All of the tracks are edited version of the songs. Most rap fans know the real, unedited versions of these tracks and will be thrown off by this. There should have been an option to choose edited or unedited. Finally, the game forces you to sing choruses to each song. Again, most rap fanatics know and like the hooks, but you don't pick up a rap video game expecting to be judged by your ability to sing the choruses. Most of us just want to focus on the verses. And since you're judged on every note the game asks you to attack, choruses will hurt your overall score if you're not a big singer.

There is no tutorial in how to play the card game.  You are expected to know how in this game, and if you don't then pray you know someone who can teach you on the fly.  That being said, you really only need to be a beginner at the game at first.  The first AI's are simple to beat, do not play their decks to the fullest and can easily be 'frightened' into playing defense when they really should be playing offense.Caution:  Build, customize, expirement or loseThat said, the game does offer a multitude of cards.  Do not expect your mix and match starter deck to lead you to beating the game.  Be willing to expierement as you purchase new packs with duel points, or DP, the in game currency provided for dueling as well as can be found.  If you do not adjust your deck to a particular strategy, prepare for the frustration of being unable to progress.  Once again though there is an upside.  With over 4500 cards, there is a great many strategies you can base your decks on, and just as many 'tweaks' you can do to make that strategy better.Caution: Frustrating trapsWe asked for it in past games, and we have it in this one:  The ability to play a trap at every applicable moment.  Seriously, I don't think we knew what we were asking for.  Be prepared to by rapidly hitting the B button if you want to save a trap or quick play magic card for later.  Just for an example, this is how an opponent's turn might work out:Draw phase: do you want to activate a card.Standby phase: do you want to activate a cardMain Phase 1:(Opponent plays a monster) do you want to activate a card(Opponent sets a card) do you want to activate a card(Opponent activates a magic card) do you want to activate a cardBattle Phase:(Opponent declares an attack) do you want to activate a card(entering battle) do you want to activate a card(entering damage step) do you want to activate a card(the opponent plays a trap) do you want to activate a cardRepeat the above for each attack the opponent makes.Main Phase 2: (Optional)possible repeat of Main phase 1End phase.Then it begins again, but this time with your own turn.So with all of these cautions, you might ask me, \"Brandon, why did you rate the game so high?\"My answer:Because everything above is what makes the game great.  The ability to play a challenging game with so many options, strategies and opportunities to react.  Even if you don't like the story, even if you don't like the movement system (check other reviews for info on those), if you like the yu-gi-oh card game, then this game is for you.Also, don't forget about the value.  I have a friend who is coming up to spending $2000.00 on a total card collection and travels miles to get to a place where he can play the game with other people.Here, you have accesss to just as many cards, if not more, and can play against the people from all over the world, all from the comfort of your home and for a decent price.

You will find that you have been thrusted off the top of the tower, well at least your shadow will fall the length of the tower. You will then have to navigate the world all the way back up the tower by running in the shadow of what lies in the foreground.Graphically this has the feel of a Wii game written all over it, yes the artistic style is unique, but in the foreground you're going to find a lot of objects that don't try to excel in pushing the Wii to the limit. It might have something to do with the fact the important graphics are the actual shadows of said objects.The music selection is slightly haunting and eerie, but the sounds of the levels will easily drown out the music.The controls are very basic. You're going to need to use the nunchuck for movement, and the Wii mote to point at objects that could possibly be manipulated to change the shadows and allow you to get further into the level.The concept is unique with the fact that the most important pieces of the game laying in shadow, but there's just not enough there to make this feel like a mind-blowing experience. You'll fight monsters in the shadow, and you'll have to dodge all sorts of objects to continue in your quest, but there are times when the shadows just don't give you enough information to go on and you'll get that feeling of truly being lost. Perhaps this is what they are going for, but all I find is frustration. Yes there's a lot of levels to this game, but the addition of complexity isn't noticeable enough for me that I couldn't tell you what was different between one level and another. There's also a couple of times where it appears that you're able to make a jump, one that you've made dozens of times in other places, but for some reason the game basically gives you a \"so close, but that's not going to work\" feel.Now the object of each level is going to be to collect these eyes that are spaced out in the level, you'll see that you'll have an indicator on the left that will tell you how many you have and how many remain. If you try to approach the shadow of billowing black smoke without all the pieces you will find that damage will be inflicted upon you. Speaking of damage, you do have the ability to take some hits before going down, so don't worry about messing up ever so slightly.If this game was on any other system I don't think that it would have been a good game, I'm not saying that because its on the Wii it gets a pass, but the level of games on the Wii, historically, show that a more artsy game can reside on the system just fine. If you're looking for something different, and don't mind the ever so slightly rise and repeat feel to the game, with the exception of the level name changing from time to time, I'd say give this game a whirl. For those out there looking for a bit more substance, and something to really sink your teeth into, you might find that this game is lacking.

I'm going to be fairly critical of this game as this review goes on, but there are many redeeming factors within the title's numerous moments of monotony.Have you ever wondered what it might be like to be a shadow? Me neither, but HudsonSoft apparently asked that question at a development conference or something, which ultimately led to this game. You play the role of an amnesiac shadow that has been separated from its body, and the only thing you know to do is climb this tower and get back to your body. You're accompanied by a kind sylph who wants to help you.. which looks a lot more like a fairy than a sylph. But whatever. :PEssentially, the gameplay is that of a 2D platformer. However, since you are a shadow, you cannot jump from platform to platfom. No sir, you have to jump from the shadows of the platforms. It's a very interesting effect. Occasionally, you have to use the Wii Remote to move the shadows by having your fairy manipulate the light source of the room. The process is very simple and quite fun to do.There are also shadow corridors, which are just big fancy shadow puzzles Hudson stuck in the middle of levels for no apparent reason. They're some of the best parts of the game, so let's be glad they did. :)You'll come across a decent number of different enemies in Lost in Shadow. Using your sword, you employ Zelda II style tactics to slash your way through. There's a leveling system that gives XP whenever you kill something. The enemies make good sound effects, but ultimately, the fact that all of these enemies are shadows make the fighting a little dull. I played this game on the highest difficulty, which probably made them cause additional damage. I suspect their dullness would be even worse if you can just walk through them on the normal and easy settings.This game is pretty long. You're getting your money's worth for the $20 it now costs new. However, this game can get pretty boring due to that the many of the zones feel so repetitive. What makes things worse is that they introduce some new mechanics toward the end of the game. I would be rating this game with 5 stars if only these things had been introduced earlier.Lost in Shadow is good.. heck, Lost in Shadow is great, but it needed just a few more elements to be considered truly awesome.

As far as I am concerned, it is one of the only Wii games I have played through to completion.  Rather amazing for me since I have tried and thrown up on most of the Wii games out there.The game plays out in much of an \"Ico\" fashion, if you can understand what that means.  Basically, you start the game knowing next to nothing about what is going on.  You are a shadow torn from a child and thrown from a tower.  Through the course of the game, while you climb the tower you gain bits of knowledge on what is going on.Gameplay is enjoyable enough.  Move with the nunchuck, push buttons on the Wiimote.  At random times, you need to point at the screen to move things.  All in all, I found the controls to be solid.  Thank god it never made me swing at anything or wiggle the idiot stick.Graphics are good for a Wii game.  While you are only looking at shadows and interacting with the background of the game, the foreground has interesting objects and colors which look good and work well.  The only downside I really found was the lack of music.  There are some intense points where you get a soundtrack, but most of the game just sounds sad and lonely.All in all, this is one of the games I would put in the Top 5 or 10 on the Wii.

I told all my friends about it. I even told one of my teachers. And I bugged the guys at gamestop all week waiting for them to give me the game I had preordered. I like to think that I had realistic expectations, though, all I really wanted was good platformer with some creative uses of the shadow mechanics. Sadly, Lost in Shadow fell short of my lowest expectations.The games most noticeable failings is in combat. In game, you'll pick up a sword to deal with other shadow creatures that dwell in the mysterious tower. You'll only have a three hit combo to dispatch enemies with, but it's often not enough to kill the average enemy (spiders, early on), after slashing at an enemy you'll be stuck in place for about half-a-second, just enough time for the enemy to hit you back. You can eventually adjust your timing (or you can level up), but this makes every enemy encounter tedious.The other problem this game has is level design. To proceed from each area, you must find three \"Keys\" to unlock the \"Door\" to the next level of the tower. One will be easy to find, but the other two are usually located on opposite ends of the level. You'll usually come to a fork in the road, you better pick the right path to take, or else you'll have to backtrack because there's a switch that you need to pull at the opposite end of the level to advance. It's almost as if the game developers thought they had a good game and that we'd enjoy having to walk all over every single inch of the level.Speaking of which, I usually give mercy points to a game that tries to be \"artsy,\" but save for a few parts, Lost in Shadow is very dull. I hope you like industrial machines, because you'll be hearing the \"Whrrr, CLANK! Whrrr, CLANK! Whrrr, CLANK!\" of machines dozens of times. They aren't very creative with their platforming either, you'll be running on pipes and ladders for most of the game. And the real world, that's casting these shadows, is rendered in that realistic brown, grays, and bloom. It all makes Lost in Shadow an unimpressive show.The story is almost nothing. You're a boy's shadow making his way up the tower. There's more, but that's mostly it. This is all fed to you by the tiniest of drops littered through out the game. You have to search for memories throughout the level, and this increases your HP (instead of by leveling up, like any normal game might do). There's a few instances when the game does try to tell you a little bit more, but you know what? I couldn't read them. They scroll by too fast! Who's the moron who programmed it that way!Oh, there's also \"Shadow Corridors\" mini-levels inside each level. Half of them are good. Some of them are what I wanted, good platforming with shadows. The other half are trial-and-error \"puzzles\" where you have to move the stage around. These would be fine, if there were only one or two \"switches,\" but the shadow corridors are usually, five of these things in a row. And when you come out of a Shadow Corridor, all of the enemies in a level have respawned. Great, more combat.There's a more, but I'd rather not rant anymore. I should mention that I haven't beaten the game. I'm 55% done, I'm on the 52nd floor. And I'm never going to finish this game, because I'm returning it this afternoon. I just can't stand it anymore. The level design is atrocious. I've begun to loathe playing it. This was the last straw: on the 52nd floor, there's a ladder, and at the top of that ladder are two sleeping monsters. One of those will shoot you automatically when it wakes up. You have to climb  the ladder, and kill them before they shoot you. Remember how there's half-a-second in combat where you can't run away? There's half-a-second in ladder climbing before you can start attacking. So the damn thing wakes up, I get shot and fall off. And if you try again, it will always shoot you. You got to kill yourself, and then it will be back asleep when you try again.Oh, and this game keeps track of how many times you died. I've died 24 times. Usually because of crappy combat, and dumb-ass design choices like those. There's supposed to be a story reason counting, but screw it I don't care anymore. Did I just rage-quit? Yeah, I guess I did. Congratulations, Lost in Shadow, you beat me. Other people can beat you, but I'm not one of them. Good for them.So, for tedious combat, obnoxious level design, no saving grace story, and just overall unpolished gameplay, I give Lost in Shadow a 2 out of 5.

It's not an excellent game, but it is kind of cool.Here's the premise:  you're a shadow.  Something cut you off from your body, and you have to get back to your body.  You can walk on shadows, but you can't walk in the real world.  However, you do have a fairy guide that can move stuff around for you in the real world to adjust the shadows, adding a bit of a puzzle element to the game in addition the the straight line maze.There's not really any action involved, and not really much of a storyline that I've seen so far.  In each level you have to touch 3 red things to make the black shadow wall disappear.  It's very straight forward, but the further you advance, the more challenging it becomes trying to figure out the puzzle aspect of it.The game does not take very long, and it is not very complex.  You could probably beat it in about 6-8 hours with average-level puzzle skills and a little help.  Unless you got completely stuck, I don't think you could take more than 12-15 hours to beat it.  As such, I'd recommend renting it, not buying it.  Almost anyone can afford 6-8 hours of game time in a down-week, and a week long rental probably costs $5 somewhere rather than $35 to buy the game.Although it's rated E for Everyone, a few things I'd keep in mind.  First of all, some puzzles are not for young children.  They're great for learning critical thinking skills and interacting with 3D objects, but if you've got a perfectionist toddler who's going to throw a fit if he gets stuck (or a perfectionist husband that acts the same way, such as myself :) ...), then this might not be for them.  Second, there is a little fear involved.  It's not that much. I wouldn't call it horror, but it does get a little scary.  I let my 21-month-old watch, and there were a couple of times he jumped.  If he was a little older, it might have given him nightmares.  Not likely, but possible if you have really young children who get scared of shadows or would be disturbed seeing an implication of an executioner and a hanging body (note: implication; you don't see a noose, blood, or anything grotesque).The music isn't Final Fantasy, but it's classic and worth getting a soundtrack if they make one.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Interesting Puzzle-Type Game", "unixReviewTime": 1295049600, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2011"}

It reminds me much of Ico, with its quiet, moody atmosphere.The game is done in somber tones, browns mostly, and as a shadow you are moving in a fairly horizontal / vertical 2D flat reflection against a far wall. The game plays with this - if you move around a tower your shadow wraps. If you move against a field of near-far objects, your shadow hops back and forth. You have to find shadows of ladders to climb, jump over shadows of spikes, and dodge the shadow enemies.Much of the game is about tagging certain locations in order to continue. So you scour each level looking for those objects. As with many games, sometimes it's frustrating to go all the way in one direction only to have to haul all the way back to the other. I wish level designers would realize that's just annoying, not fun.Still, I like the combination of puzzle solving and physics explorations. You can rotate some levels which cause the shadows to change. You can move objects. You gain memories along the way, which increases your health bar.Yes, sometimes there are things to hang you up. The controls aren't always perfectly responsive. Sometimes you can see what you have to do and it's a matter of timing. But again these are issues common with most games, so you stick with it, get that timing nailed, and feel the satisfaction of moving on.In an era where many games are full of blaring loud music and screaming obscenities, I greatly enjoyed having a game that's more about thought and shadows and how one looks at the world.Well recommended.Rating: 8/10I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Atmospheric Puzzle Game", "unixReviewTime": 1345075200, "reviewTime": "08 16, 2012"}

Indeed Lost In Shadow introduces something conceptually new. The idea that one could play as a shadow is not what is cool by itself, but how successfully the game was designed to show interactions of the shadow of a boy with variously shaped geometric objects and their interaction with the sunlight.Basically the way it works is as if the sunlight is directed from your perspective onto the environment. A shadow is cast and that is on what the shadow you play as can stand.Once you are past the introductory levels difficulty goes up a notch.The positive things I write about Lost in Shadow unfortunately come with some drawbacks. I run my Wii through 480p cable which improves visual quality on most games played from the Wii because the image is sharper. However, Lost In Shadow  ,either by design or intentionally, does not look very sharp. It is possible that it was designed to make the shadows look somewhat blurry because of how shadows look like in the real world. Light diffuses and you see oblique shapes in one type of light, or really sharp shadows in different type of light (such as under a bright lamp at night) The blur effect also makes solid objects look less sharp than I'd like to. Lack of sharpness makes you fall of and die in different spots because you're not sure of the shadow's collision boundary.I'd say this is a must-play Wii game that is appropriate for all ages, and not just a kids game. Exploration and puzzle solving may become difficult sometimes but that is how this game is designed, so I wouldn't fault it for that.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent Game With Few Technical Problems", "unixReviewTime": 1319328000, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2011"}

Foster", "helpful": [35, 39], "reviewText": "Lost In Shadow is not so much a brand new concept in game design but a homage to past successes.  The developers seem to take the basic design from classics like ICO (PS2) and more currently, Limbo (xbox 360) -- both cult hits.You play as the shadow of a young boy which has been forcibly \"removed\" from the boy as shown in the opening scenes.  Your shadow is banished to the bottom of a tower and now begins your journey to reach the top of the tower and reunite with your body.In the foreground you see the physical objects that any game would normally consist of, but you actually play and interact in the background, ie the shadows of the foreground objects.  The game tries to be a combination of rpg, adventure, action and mostly problem solving, yet by not committing to a single type of game play, I began to grow tired of the varying styles.  Some puzzles require you to manipulate the light source coming into the tower so that the shadows of certain objects move which then allows you to advance throughout the levels while other cases require you to actually rotate the screen to gain a new perspective.  This was done very well but every now and then the camera angle will move in a way in which you cannot see the depths of the shadows in the background.  A little frustrating but not a big problem.Of course you encounter enemies throughout the way and you mostly fight them with your sword (other times you have to just avoid enemies completely), noting rpg syles.  This gets old fast.  You collect memories as you go which increases your shadows weight -- similar to a life bar.  The music and sound is sparce throughout the game but this actually works to add to the creepiness of the style and really sets the mood.Overall this is a fairly dark and disturbing game but with the ever increasing difficulty of puzzles to solve and the way in which you can manipulate your environment make this a game worth trying.  I am glad I bought it for under $40 and hopefully the next one in the series will improve on the minor flaws.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Unique Concept That Ultimately Falls Flat", "unixReviewTime": 1294963200, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2011"}

Initially, I thought this game was not going to bring much to the table on the single campaign or the multiplayer, but I was dead wrong.Single Campaign - The story is very gripping, thrilling, and epic. MW2 nor any other COD campaigns has a story, such as this one. Of course, the setting is during the Cold War Era. Your character is being interrogated by some unknown individuals about his role in various classified missions. His explanations are played out in the missions, which you will endure. The levels are filled with everything you can think of, which is mass enemies, and many explosions. Players will fight in various places, such as Cuba, Vietnam jungles, the dark corridors and rooftops of Kowloon city in Hong Kong, Laos, and the snowy landscapes of Russia (cliche').Graphics/Sound - The graphics will not exactly remind players of MW2. However, they are still superb. On the contrary, the characters remind me of how the characters look on GTAIV. The sound is ok. However, if you are looking for a FPS with more realistic sounding weapons, I recommend BFBC2 or MOH.Gameplay - The gameplay of this game is the same as any other COD title, which is a good thing.Multiplayer Pros - I am glad that Treyarch got rid of the noob perks, such as commando (most hated), one man army, double wielded shotguns, tactical insertions, ridiculous explosion radius, painkiller, and many others we have grown to hate in MW2. Therefore, the multiplayer relies more on skill.The multiplayer is deeper and more customizable than any COD title. The player has many, many options. The greatest new option is the theater mode, which allows players to replay and record previously played matches. After each match, it is saved for review. During replay, bars is shown, which gives the player the options to either play, fast forward, or record the previously played match. The player has the options to replay the whole match or go straight to each kill or death.Another new mode is called Combat Training. This allows players to practice multiplayer with or without friends in the maps against CPU enemies. The skill level can be tweaked to your liking. These enemies have good AI. They have some good aim, and will nail you. I would recommend this option for people, who are new to the series or want to get a feel for fighting in new maps.Other multiplayer options are to earn COD cash, which can buy new weapons. Then, they have a mode, which you can sign a contract to earn COD cash. For example, you can sign a contract to earn COD cash for knifing an enemy in the back. The contracts constantly change, which is a good thing. There are many other game modes. Of course, if you have not been hiding under a rock, you know about the Wager Matches and the One Shot matches to name a few.Multiplayer Cons - The selections of weapons are not as deep as other COD titles. Not to mention, the hit detection is horrible. Either the weapons are not as powerful or the enemies can take more bullets. There have been times, where I have shot an enemy four times, and I was not able to drop him.The Verdict - In my opinion, this is the best COD because of the single campaign, and the tremendous depth of the multiplayer. The many options can keep players very busy for a while. At this point, I do not know what options are left for multiplayer in upcoming COD titles. Treyarch really dug deep with the various amounts of options they gave to the player. The graphics are a shade below COD standard. However, if that is not your hang up, this title is worth owning.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best COD campaign. Deep multiplayer", "unixReviewTime": 1289520000, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2010"}

BADER \"Q8  AL BADER\"", "helpful": [13, 30], "reviewText": "First off: The zombie mode is a joke, the voice acting is absolutely lame even if it's meant to be a parody. I put about 20 bullets into a zombie (deliberately no headshots) and it didn't die. I then walked up to it, and slashed its leg with the knife and it died! I ran past hordes of zombies, went to the point of red screen imminent death...survived every time. Then I ran past a single zombie, who must have just scratched me (as I was already a metre past it)... and I died. I threw a grenade and it exploded 3 metres to the right of where it landed it! (and it didn't bounce off a wall) Frustrating, and very inconsistent.The campaign mode is mind numbingly boring.Control: You have very little control over the actions, it's simply Treyarch holding your hand in guiding certain actions through crappy cutscene after crappy cutscene. Absolutely frustrating, when you move two steps and lo and behold you have lost the ability to aim, crouch, run, shoot...etc and the weapons you are given are fixed for certain events. I agree with the poster who wrote even if you shoot a foot away from the head in a particular scene - it will end up between his eyes! Total Joke.Graphics: The graphics are awful, jarring, blurry and glitchy. So much of the 'action' happens so quickly you don't have time to appreciate any of the scenery, it's very manic. Perhaps they designed the gameplay this way so you are distracted away from the poor graphics, and landscape. Explosions are unrealistic. The worst aspect is when you are in 'interrogation' and Treyarch decided to SCREW PEOPLES MINDS with an explosion of light flashes, random images of war, more flashes, jarred sounds, more flashes, pictures for a few split second, more flashes... AHHHH SHOOT ME ALREADY, THIS IS KILLING ME! It's not a safe game for people to play that have sensitivity to light, are epileptics, or generally anyone that is prone to migraines, severe headaches or motion sickness. It's totally exaggerated. I understand the idea that you are traversing someones memories - which is fine, but we don't need to be mind-raped in this way.Sound: The grenades pop, and it feels like you are shooting with a pellet gun. The music has been compiled in a terrible manner. There is music where there shouldn't be and none where there should be. Good (appropriate) music makes games feel epic, and what did Treyarch do? They had a Rolling Stones song (Sympathy of the Devil) 'Pleased to meet you...hope you guess my name' playing in one of the scenes. Are you kidding me?! Out of place or what, and crucifies its sense of epic.Characters: Honestly, you won't care about any of them. They are so annoying, and the dialogue written for them is woeful. They all seem to sound alike as well, the husky I-sound-like-batman put-on marine voice. I had to put subtitles on, so I knew who was actually speaking! The russian 'Reznov' is irritating and it gets so boring hearing what a fantastic patriot he is, and how we should fight for freedom bla bla. This has all been done before in MW2 right?! What really irritated me was how everyone you are working with seem to treat you like a low life scum. I am cool with swearing, but the use of expletive F word was excessive and at times unnecessary. // Minor spoiler alert: You are asked about the numbers, 'what numbers?' you reply, then several scenes later 'ahhh these f'ing numbers are killing me! can't get them out my head' End of minor spoiler alert/// No, awful dialogue and woeful storyline is killing you!Glitches?: I shot and killed a few people and they remained frozen in that same firing pose. I thought they had godmode enabled until I looked closer and realised they were already dead. Sergei, the 'big guy' will endlessly try and break down a door if you stay to watch - it's funny. The ally AI, should have been more interactive. Maybe they should have spoke to you if you went up to them, wondering why they were repeatedly trying to barge a steel door! not a glitch as such, but yes you can run through the entire game without killing enemies to reach the checkpoints and unlock the next objective. Pointless having enemies in front of you if you don't actually have to kill them.Black Ops? Stealth? What steal...? the two or three times you are invited to walk up behind someone and activate a cutscene of strangulation, or stab in the neck?! The game is mis sold. I feel the Call of Duty franchise is better off without this addition. It adds nothing but frustration. You have all the ingredients, and resources to create something that will raise standards in gaming but fluff it big time. I can not believe how rushed this game feels. It should read: Black Ops: Beta Version 0.917171923.Online Mode: My experience was totally ruined by lag issues and awful awful choice of maps. The guns are just pellet guns! I dislike the exclusion of XP points to unlock weapons from previous games.If you want my opinion, Modern Warfare 1 is the most polished and realistic game of the series. The single player campaign mode is also the best, but very short. Still, it's infinitely better than this pile of garbage. For online play, go with Modern Warfare 2, for the fun, fast and responsive play and better online servers.In short: Don't buy it, take it off a friend, then get rid of it. Buy MW2, or Battlefield 2, or just wait for Gran Turismo 5 to just sit back and enjoy the stunning ability of the ps3 graphics core.Sorry the frustration of playing this game bled into my review.

{"reviewerID": "A3S4Z5JUS03FJQ", "asin": "B003JVCA9Q", "reviewerName": "aka TRAP", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewText": "My first CoD game was CoD2: Big Red One on the original Xbox.  It wasn't anything special, but it was a fun game.  Then CoD2 on the 360, CoD4 on the same console & the PS3, and eventually Modern Warfare 2.  If you haven't read my review on that game, long story short, I hate it.  So I'm not too excited about playing this for the first time thanks to the nasty taste Modern Warfare 2 left in my mouth, but after playing it over friend's rooms multiple times, I ended up buying the game.I have to say, Treyarch did what Infinity Ward couldn't...make a decent Call of Duty game.  Let's start off with the single player.For one, the story actually makes sense.  It's actually told in past-tense until a certain part of the campaign (literally right before the very end) let's you know what is really going on.  You play a character named Mason who's been tied up in a mysterious room and is being interrogated by two unknown people.  This is how the main menu even looks.  Where it says \"Campaign, Multiplayer\", you can look around the room, and look down at your character as he's tied up.  It doesn't affect my rating, but I do think this was a nice feature.  But anyway, the game takes place during the days of JFK/Lyndon B Johnson's presidencies.  As we all know (or should know) about the Bay of Pigs, this game let's you play as one of those assigned to assassinate Fidel Castro back in the 60's, only to see the attempt fail miserably (in reality, those that participated were executed).  I wish I could go into greater detail, but I can't without spoiling the game.  However I will say that Treyarch made the campaign just a tad bid longer than Modern Warfare 2 (took me six hours on Normal), and the story is easy(er) to follow.  Again, you won't fully understand what's going on until the very end when the game basically goes \"This is why Mason's being interrogated, and this is why everything happened the way it did up to this point\".Now for those that couldn't care about the singleplayer, this part is for you.  How does the multiplayer compare to Modern Warfare 2?It's amazing!  For one, the online is more balanced than Modern Warfare 2.  No longer can you do too much with everything while people abuse it.  They also took out the perk that increased bullet damage (I can't remember the name of it....that's how much I miss it), but kept those that allow deeper bullet penetration, Ninja, Scavenger, and just renamed some perks that do mostly the same thing as the ones in Modern Warfare 2, but with various twist.  For example, the one that lets you have two attachments to a gun also provides you with two Lethal projectiles (Frags, Semtex, etc.) and two Tactical projectiles (Nova gas, stun grenades, etc.).  Combine that with Scavenger and you can continue to replenish your two projectile types.  It doesn't get abused due to the fact that using them doesn't always work to your advantage, even if you're smart and cook your frags or wait to use them.  If you throw two flash bangs, you can still be shot straight through them and be killed (I would know..I've done it), and frag grenades don't always guarantee a kill.Another thing that's done right is the reduced lag compared to the last CoD.  Yes, it's still there, and yes, sometimes the host will quit the game, but being stabbed miles away from the person no longer exists, people hardly camp in every corner on maps, and you can't have shotguns as secondaries anymore.  Machine pistols have also been eliminated.  One thing that is a negative is bullet registration.  While not as bad as MW2, sometimes you can shoot at someone directly, but still miss.  This is mainly due to the insane recoil experienced while being shot.  It'll turn a chest shot into one that goes inches above the head, resulting in a death.  Other times, like when using the M16, shots just won't register at all, and you have to fire another burst to kill them.  While annoying, it doesn't hamper my playing style, and you learn to work around it (such as aiming down at the feet, just in case the recoil sends your gun upwards).  Also, the maps are more open instead of being closed off like MW2.  By open, I mean there's alot more room to run around, but not alot to sit there and hide from people.  They also included Wager Matches, games you bet your COD points (monetary system in the game), and placing Third or better grants you a profit.  Gun Game pits you against five other players, and the first person to get a kill with all 20 weapons (once you kill someone with a gun, they give you another one), wins.  Another one is One In The Chamber.  This game gives you three lives and one bullet to work with.  Killing people (shooting them or stabbing them) gives you another bullet, and the last man standing wins.  So you have your usual Domination, TDM, CTF, and Headquarter games, but they also threw in a few new ones to keep the online fresh for months to come.The only reasons I gave this four stars is the bullet issues mentioned above, issues with lag are still there, and the campaign is still too short for my liking.  It's understandable to focus on the selling point of the game, but that doesn't mean the game can't have an amazing campaign.  It's great, but not an \"OMG!! I wanna play that again\" campaign.  But whether you care about the singleplayer or not, Black Ops is a great improvement over the trash they named Modern Warfare 2.CoD4 vet improved!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Take notes, Infinity Ward", "unixReviewTime": 1301184000, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2011"}

Since everyone was just starting out on the first night, the game was very good because it was easy to see who the best players were, and i continually pulled in games with a 3:1 at worst kill/death. As the days wear on though the game has become very full of lags and hosts dropping out as well as the glitched lobbies and campers. But thats a player issue. The maps have many paths, but they are all big and the respawns are God awful. Ive been mowed down by guys that were shooting before i was respawned! The main thing the game brings is complete customization. Instead of levels or challenges having to be beaten you earn money and can buy the guns you want and the attachments, as well as the lethal/nonlethal equipment, killstreaks, perks (the perks have different names and weird pictures), and things such as facepaint or callsigns. This becomes cool until you realize your customization takes longer than your gameplay, all i wanted to do was put my initals on my callsign and gun, but the letters only go from A-E....what the heck? The guns are cool, but you wont know most of them unless you are a history buff. I enjoy pulling out my Makarov, but it takes the whole clip to kill someone. The health is way higher and paired with the recoil it makes you work for the kills. When asked if Black Ops is better than MW2 id hesitate for probably 10 years. Black Ops has the \"it\" factor when you open it up and play it for a couple hours, but the shine quickly wears off. Id say they are even, but i grit my teeth trying to say Black Ops is better and i just cant pull the trigger. Id definetly rent it first and foremost, or borrow it. Id rather have MW2 because i enjoy the modern games because of the weapons, the ever expandable gameplay, and lastly INFINITY WARD!!!! The thing that i love about Black Ops is the gun game and the knowledge that Activisiion was trying to remake its game. The thing that ruined the game for me though is the ruining of the strategic games (Sabotage or Search and Destroy). The levels feel cool and great at first, but than you wonder if someone had a dream one night and it was just incorperated into the game.

That evolved to Goldeneye on Nintendo 64. That all changed when Metal Gear Solid came out for PS1 and I now wanted a good story to go along with my gameplay. I have always kind of liked the COD world war series, but never got into it. When MW1 came out I was blown away, I loved the game and it had a good story to tell. My only complaint with MW2 was that the story was not only lacking, but down right stupid. I never got into multiplayer because I don't have the time to train myself to compete with a bunch of 5th graders who spend 40 hours a week playing the game.This all leads me to Black Ops, as with all 1st person shooters the campaign is short, yet good. The action is intense and the overall gaming is fun. What made the campaign even more fun was that I felt fully drawn into the game due to the compelling story. I actually wanted to check out zombies but I could not draw myself away from the campaign in order to check it out. The story was that good; I wanted to find out what happens. I'm not going into detail what the story is about because you probably already read that somewhere else. As far as the graphics, I thought they looked sharp. The scenery was not as sharp as MW2 because their seemed to be a haze in the air everywhere I went but it was still looking good. My favorite part was in Vietnam they started playing rock music from the time of the Vietnam War, which made it fill even more authentic.As far as zombies go, it's fun to shoot zombies every now and then when I have a few free minutes so it's a nice add-on bonus.Bottom line, if you are a lone wolf player like me, this is definitely the game for you.

Then it all feels different and one's first reaction is \"this is not as fun\". After playing this game for over a month, then going back to play MW2 online again, I definitely like the online game play of Black Ops better.The music and game play sounds are better to start with. You can hear more detail, not only do you hear the pin from a grenade being pulled, but which direction was just thrown from as well.The weapons are much more varied, but better at not having a select few be overpowered. The addition of weapons such as the under barrel flame thrower attachment and the crossbow make for a more random game play. Can't say I have ever played another online game where a guy can get shot with an explosive arrow, and while he runs for cover behind all his teammates, it goes off and he blows them all up.The removal of the nuclear strike is a welcomed change. The only person who enjoyed that was the person setting off the nuke. Everyone else who was in the middle of working on their kill streaks just gets their game ended. The ability to customize every detail, from face paint to gun camo it a fun addition, making each players guns their own.There have been some teething problems with the stability of the servers hosts since the games launch. From inability to keep connected through a whole game, to lobbies getting stuck and the rounds not launching at all. Thankfully though, with the most recent game update, almost all of these problems have been fixed and only now are there occasional game disconnects. Had their been a public BETA testing of the games servers, this probably would have been avoided. Hopefully this lesson has been learned by Treyarch, in case they ever do another Call of Duty game.Offline Play:The storyline is darker than that of Modern Warfare 2. While you play the same character throughout this game (unlike the changing of characters in MW2), the game definitely has a twist at the end. The game has significantly more swearing and acts of prisoner torture. The \"No Russian\" airport mission in MW2 has nothing on the torture scenes in this game. Basically, I'm saying this is not for the little kids.I personally like the offline storyline and game play of MW2 better. I found the missions in Black Ops to feel a little like going through the same mouse maze over and over, just with different scenery and more viciousness. It seemed in Black Ops, the goal was to be better at stabbing people in the head, instead of taking down an enemy with one shot at 500 yards. The game play in Black Ops felt more constricted and the graphics weren't quite as dynamic as MW2. Still, the game holds it's own and is worth plaything through.Conclusion:In a head to head comparison of Black Ops and Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops (with it's new stable server updates) wins for better online play, while MW2 has a more fun offline play.Tip:After you have played through the entire offline game, wait for the credits to end and you will get a new zombie game.

Well.. One of my friends- who is a big CoD fan, bought this game, and I ussually come over to play with him. Before BO, I had bought Mw2, which I soon hated(yes- its true.). I found that Black Ops is quite fun. One of the first reasons why I really enjoyed this game Is the split-screen multiplayer. No other CoD had that, or as I remember. I was able to play alongside my friend in Black Ops when I would come over. Treyarch- who worked with Activision on this game, and many other great games (Ex: Spider-Man 2), had seemed to work hard on this game. I understand that the graphics aren't even close to what you would expect, but I didn't care. What makes Black Ops so fun and unique from other CoD games is first of all- the customization. The customization of the guns and equipment is deep and Activision used a \"money\" system for unlocking- which is another reason why I love this game. I am not very good at shooters, and I am prone to die a lot in Multiplayer, which was why I sold Mw2. The money system ensured that I could always progress, and buy the things that I wanted by completing game modes and such. The maps in Multiplayer are average, however the gameplay is very balanced- in my own opinion. I thought that the idea of contracts gave more of a challenge, in order to unlock more money. Overall, this Call of Duty in the sense of multiplayer is the best. the only thing I didn't like in the mp was some of the killstreak combinations, which would allow players, if they were good enough, to completley destroy the enemy team and hog all the kills via the Chopper Gunner and Attack Dogs.One more thing that made black ops stand out was the addition of Bots (A.I.). I really liked this because I could practice for multiplayer on \"Combat Training\", which have you levels like Mp. The bots are not that fun to play with, but a nice addition if one wants to shy away from Mp or cannot handle it, like me sometimes lol.SingleplayerThe campaign also got a lot of negative criticism from the online community, which i was slightly suprised about. The story takes place in the cold war, where your character- Alex Mason(voiced by Sam Worthington) is in an interrogation chair and has to retell his events about these \"numbers\". The campaign gameplay seems to be fun and unique, with different environments and objectives. I believe one of the reasons why the story was so harshly criticized is because the story gets very confusing, especially towards the end(no spoilers). Anyway, the campaign was solid and I've replayed it several times.Zombies and other stuffThis was the first Call of Duty that I had played which featured zombies (I never played CoD :WaW), and I never really got into it. The objectives are simple enough, where you survive and kill zombies, while trying to unlock secrets embedded in the Zombies story. I've only played zombies with friends, as I don't get far at all playing solo. I didn't like how the zombies mode was linear, and not very open- worldish. All I have to say about zombies in general is to play with friends, unless if you are really good at it.So- basically, I genuinely believe that this game is very underrated, and recieved a lot of hate. So far, this is my favorite Call of Duty, next to Modern Warfare (1). Treyarch appeared to create something different, and succeeded. I am looking forward to Black Ops 2.Pros:-Multiplayer is quite fun, especially via Split-screen.-Solid Campaign-deep customization + great money system- theatre mode is fun to look at (sorry I forgot to mention that)Cons:-Multiplayer can become very frustrating while playing with very skilled players (killstreaks)-no 4 player split-screen for Zombies-confusing story at times-crappy graphicsIt has flaws, bad graphics, and it's another CoD, so it has reasons to be a bad game, however Treyarch added dozens of new features and actually TRIED. (my opinion). I'd say give it a chance- not as good as Modern Warfare (1), but so much better than the other CoDs.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Extremely underrated (long review)", "unixReviewTime": 1345593600, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2012"}

The critics, on the other hand, generally liked it. I like it too.My favorite thing with modern video games is taking in the stories. This one did not disappoint. I really got into it. At times when I should have gone to bed, I stayed up playing to find out what was next. The characters are many but memorable. So... It's not confusing even though you play as several different characters and in doing so are accompanied by several recurring others. The fact that the story unfolds through several pairs of eyes is really cool. I found that to be extremely compelling.As for the multiplayer stuff... Bravo! That's a blast online or against bots. I frequently do that when I have 10 minutes to kill. The game has an esoteric array of weapons from the \"Real World\" and it's in the multiplayer mode that you really get to try them all out. It really is great fun. The maps are awesome because they're all quite different from each other and each one requires the player to make thoughtfull choices about his or her load out. In other words: a shotgun is better in one map, an SMG is better in another, and so on... Also, various types of sights will serve one better depending on the map as will other attachments. To be really effective you have to taylor your loadout. I'm not saying this is a new concept. It just seems to be implemented more elegantly in this game.There's an additional CO OP game called \"Zombies\" that admittedly isn't \"my cup of tea\". But, what the heck? It's there. Other people might like it. It's nice that there's even more to be had in this package that I would consider to be well worth the money even without additional content.I'm giving this game the highest rating because I think it's really enjoyable on many levels.

Sadly, within minutes of starting to play, I was taken back to the slow motion train wreck that was COD:World At War - the last time Treyarch had the reigns.The singleplayer mode is very poor this time around. Even a complete novice could probably finish it in 7 or 8 hours. I was done with it in 5. The storyline shows that they've completely run out of ideas for the COD franchise now - it chops and changes, jumping backwards and forwards in time, in missions that span a couple of decades, that attempt to change established history too. By the halfway point, you won't know where you're supposed to be or who it is you're playing. Did you assassinate Carter or Castro? In the final chapter, you actually end up playing the level twice from two different points of view. Clever, but confusing nonetheless.The graphics are very obviously from Treyarch too. There's a look and feel to them that singles Treyarch games out - too glossy, too colourful, too much aliasing (crawling) in the textures and way the hell too much popup (where things just blink into existence in front of you as you run). In this respect it looks and feels just like COD:World At War and they've obviously used the same graphics engine. It turns out they've likely used the same audio engine too. On a PS3, hooked up to a 5.1 digital surround system, there's so much echo that you end up playing with the sound turned down. World At War had the exact same issue - something which does not affect the Infinity Ward COD titles. Treyarch's audio engine makes every shot sound like a firecracker dropped down a toilet. You can be standing in the middle of an open field and it still echos, and the echo carries over to all the other sound effects too. Run through the sea in the \"Crisis\" online map and it sounds like you're sploshing around in tile-walled toilet.I'll focus the rest of this short review around online play as this is ultimately where you'll end up spending 95% of your time with this game.Or at least you would be if it worked.This title suffers from the worst online play I've ever seen. Every game will drop you out due to a \"connection error\". If you're lucky, the game will come back. If not, you'll be dropped back into the lobby, which will close moments later. About 50% of the time it simply crashes the PS3, resulting in the three little \"reboot me\" beeps, before it shuts down.Before getting dropped from a game, you'll discover that the hit detection in Black Ops is fundamentally flawed. In previous COD games, when playing online, a certain amount of latency was inevitable, but when you watch the killcams in Black Ops, the person who killed you (or got the winning kill) is aiming so far away from you that you'd think it would have classified as a miss.The latency is terrible and I know it's not my setup - I can pop Modern Warfare 2 in my PS3 and play decent online games, then swap back to Black Ops and face the same latency and hit detection problems.Sure the online game modes are all present and correct but some are near impossible to play because of the above problems - capture the flag being the most impossible. The respawn mechanism insists on respawning you in front of an opposing team player and the mandatory 15 second respawn delay is maddening. Free-for-fall, team deathmatch and domination are all relatively playable though which partly redeems the game - at least in the 1 game in 2 that it doesn't throw you out.These are all related to this one game - it's not a function of your PS3 or your network. As I said above - you can drop in Modern Warfare 2 and play a totally normal online game. Go back to Black Ops and all the network problems come back. It's like using a 1990's token-ring network.Treyarch are well aware of all the problems and have been trying to patch the game to fix these issues since the day it came out. On Dec 13th 2010, the second patch came out. Whereas it used to take 5 or 10 seconds to find an open lobby, the patch changed something so it took 1 or 2 minutes instead. The game still crashed the PS3, you still got connection errors and there was still appalling latency.On Dec 16th 2010 the third patch came out. Now it won't find any lobbies. So online play has gone from bad, to worse, to turned off completely. Essentially what you're buying now is a 5 hour, single-player game, and a very poor one at that. This game has been in development for 2 years - its inexcusable that Treyarch let it out with this sort of problem in it, and to \"cure\" it by simply turning off the online modes is what caused me to give up entirely. I've gone back to playing Modern Warfare 2, and you should too.Don't waste your money on this title - the single player mode is too short, and the multiplayer is (at the time of writing) dead - it's been disabled in the latest patch.Hopefully 2011 will see the reigns handed back to Infinity Ward for a Modern Warfare 3.

I began with CoD 4: Modern Warfare.  I tried CoD:5 and hated it thanks to its crappy weapons, glitches, and poor look and feel.  Modern Warfare 2 is clearly the standard by which all other FPS should be judged.  Sure, the single player storyline was weird, but I play the game for the multiplayer anyway.  In the latter I have logged many days and reached the final level of prestige (and rank in the top 150,000 out of some 12m players).So TreyArch had a lot to live up to with the latest version of CoD and without dragging this review out, they failed, dismally.While the graphics look excellent in any given still frame, my first issue with the game is the horrific and unrealistic movement of the player.  He seems to float, dance, skip and do anything other than be an actual fighter.  And the noise of his feet sounds more like My Little Pony than hardened killer.The weapons are average, although I do enjoy the way you can 'buy' the weapons and upgrade them in the order you wish.  That's a great feature.But no matter how the game has been tweaked, how many new features have been introduced that are a good idea, one cannot escape the horrific movement and stupid sound effects.A real FPS suspends your disbelief, you are in the middle of the action, you are the soldier, it's all down to you.  In this game, the sounds and poor motion distract completely from the enjoyment of the game, and it is for this reason I will almost certainly be tossing this one after just one session.Add to all these problems the fact that like the previous TreyArch offering, most of the guns take multiple hits to kill.  So you run into the stupid scenario of shooting a man with a machine gun, and he turns around and shoots you dead.  I understand that there is a hardcore option, but seriously that is just stupid.I'm sure if I could be bothered to play the game some more it would show me some other cool changes I might like.  But sadly the engine is just so poor, I don't want to waste my time.Let us hope that Infinity Ward can be somehow resurrected to make the next game, and TreyArch can do something else, like study how a human being moves and sounds.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "TreyArch Fail", "unixReviewTime": 1295136000, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2011"}

Johnson", "helpful": [51, 70], "reviewText": "Overall, I was disappointed with Modern Warfare 2 in both single player and multiplayer modes.  Single player campaign was nothing more than a your typical Hollywood action flick with all action all the time.  Needless to say, it got old very quick and the story was impossible to follow with your typical unbelievable ending.  Multiplayer while better than single player suffered from lame perks that people abused and required no skill to use.  Commando/lightweight (i.e. teleport) was possibly the cheapest perk combo in that game.  The game also suffered from bullets curving around the corner a horrible spawn system that just turned this game into a camp fest.  I really didn't mind the camping because I understood why people did it.  I mean who wants to have someone spawn right behind and shoot them in the back every 3 seconds?Enter Call of Duty Black Ops, a game that looked good on TV but based on my previous experience, I was not sure about the game and after having this game for about a week, I can honestly say my apprehensions about this game were valid but not in the areas I expected.The goodCampaign mode is much improved this time around.  While it seemed like it would end up just being a non-stop action fest during the first few missions, things really started getting good after getting to the Vietnam missions.  The story is written better and is easier to follow for the most part, but the flashbacks can be a little distracting.  But I can say for a fact that I really got addicted to the single player mode.Online play has many improvements; first of all many of the lame and cheap perks from MW2 are GONE!  This means no more commando/lightweight users, no excessive noob tube damage, and no impossible kills from all the way across the screen.  In addition there is no more stacking of kill streaks, meaning any kills you get from your kill streak rewards will NOT count towards your kill streak.  Because of this you can no longer sit back and let your kill streaks do all the work if you want to get your higher rewards.  I was guilty of this in MW2 but I welcome this change in BO and should help to cut down on camping.  This also ensures that the more powerful kill streaks rewards (11 is the highest you can get now) will be a rare occurrence which makes for good balance.  The spawning system has little improvement but still people will spawn right behind you, but from what I experienced this game is not as bad as MW2. (ummm, scratch this, see my update at the end of this review)New system for weapon upgrades.  Instead of having to get 6 million headshots to get a new camo for your gun or attachment, you now have to buy your upgrades with money you earn during your matches.  I love this change as in MW2 I became too caught up on completing challenges to get weapon upgrades which in turn forced me to use a particular weapon for all of my matches and it became more of a chore than anything.  There are many ways to earn money, but I won't go into them here.Combat training mode is an excellent way for you to practice multiplayer with computer controlled opponents and teammates with customizable game options like time limit and score. You can select the difficulty level and compete in either TDM or FFA on all online maps. In addition you earn upgrades, ranking promotions just like you would online except they don't carry over to online play.  I didn't think this mode would be much fun, but it is and is also a good way to try out and practice all the kill streak rewards (if you stay alive long enough) without the pressure or frustration online.The badWith all the improvements in both single player and multiplayer mode the negatives greatly hurt the overall quality of this game.The graphics and sound are a noticeable huge step back from MW2 and even COD4.  This does not look like a current gen game, and people who both like and dislike this game all agree the graphics are not up to par with what is currently out on the next gen systems.  Many times I have found myself comparing this game's visuals to the graphics of my XBOX (the first one) wondering which one was better.  Sound also takes a step back from the previous COD titles, as I have said in many of my comments, all explosive devices sound exactly the same, and the guns themselves just sound a little bit underpowered.  While the graphics and sound issues didn't bother me too much on single player they did distract me on online play when it was coupled with the number 1 problem with this game.....ONLINE LAG.While MW2 had MANY problems with online play, LAG was rarely an issue I encountered, this is no longer the cause with BO.  Out of all the time I had this game, I only had two or three matches that lag was minimal and this was at 2 in the morning.  The rest of my many matches suffered debilitating lag so much that many times I would just quit the game in frustration because it's impossible to kill someone when they are teleporting all over the screen.  Even the menu to get to online play is quirky; many times I had to press the \"Playstation Network\" option on the multiplayer screen multiple times JUST to get into the lobby.  Then when I get there the only thing that is guaranteed is a laggy online experience.  After the second day of putting up with this, I gave up online play altogether and played Combat training, because I just found online play well....unplayable.  All of the great improvements to multiplayer are completely ruined by the lag which is a shame.Single player is much improved but multi-player overall is a huge step back even with the improvements that were implemented.  I am glad I rented this game, because multiplayer is what makes games like these worth the cost.  But when I can't even play multi-player why would I pay full price for it?  I may end up getting this game eventually, but not until the price comes down considerably because unless they find a fix for their online mode, there is no way I'm playing this game online.My suggestion RENT before you buy.UPDATE 11/30/2010:  (Regarding the spawn system)While I originally stated that the spawn system is slightly improved over MW2, after playing more games online (360 version, since the PS3 version is unplayable online).  I can now say definitively that the spawn system is actually WORSE than MW2 and that is saying a lot.  Never before have I experienced so many instant random deaths right after I kill someone due to an enemy somehow magically appearing right behind me in the area I just left 1 second earlier.  It is absolutely ridiculous and frustrating. But hey, if you like mindless chaos and instant deaths, you will be right at home with this game.  It got so bad in fact that I decided to try my hand and hardcore since spawns take longer, but the obvious trade off is weapons are more powerful which is good in itself, until, yep! you guessed it someone spawns behind you, or spawn camps and kills you as soon as you spawn.  So while Hardcore does limit the occurrence of enemies appearing behind you, it still does not fix the obviously flawed and untested spawn system.  I hear arguments that the spawn system is like this to eliminate camping, but if this is the case, then their bass ackward plan backfired, because all this does is encourage MORE CAMPING and who can really blame players for doing so?  I find it hard to believe that the QA department at Treyarch (provided they even have one) honestly could look at this game and say the spawn system was fine.

The campaign is kind of boring really and you don't give a hoot about the characters like you did in the two Modern warfare games.  The multiplayer online maps are way too small and messy and the sound is pretty bad.  I like some of the killstreak weapons simply for their innovation, but it's still a little boring.  The fact that you can buy upgrades in any order you please is cool, but it doesn't make up for lousy graphics and boring characters.  Modern Warfare 2 was far more exciting, realistic and fun online.  This step-back in the series very well could have been a PS2 realease it is that bad for graphics.  I'm not too fond of the team types on it either.  In the Modern warfare series, the teams were more developed.  In this one, they all look the same, which can be frustrating when trying to track down the enemy.  And, I don't know if it's just my copy or what... but the game freezes a LOT on both campaign and multiplayer.  This is the only game I own that has ever done that.

It's worth buying the game simply for the zombies game. The (Zombies) dark humor and characters personalities are hilarious and enjoyable as is the gameplay of massacring tons and tons & waves and waves of screaming zombies. Quotes like the Russian character's \"Smells like my fourth wife, she stinky. Stinky but pretty. Weird combo.\" had be laughing out loud along with the WW2 Japanese character shouting \"Buew buew! Buew buew! Hahaha!\" when he shoots the raygun. Classic. The retro WW2 characters, Nazi Zombie mood & design of the Zombie game is awesome.Then comes the Black Ops.The campaign is uninspired and becomes dull very quick. Not even really worth mentioning or evaluating. It's simply blah. Infinity Ward's MW2 did a very good job of placing us in various fun locations around the world (Favela: Brazil, Russia:Airport)and creating a sense of reality and attention to detail that raised the fun factor bar. That element is missing from BOps. That sense of Diversity in locations and environments that IW gave us (snow, slums, strip mall burger land) is also sorely missing.The most important part of the Call of Duty games, and where the player really gets his money worth, comes from the repeat play of the multi-player. I have spent way way way to much time playing MW & MW2 so I'm comparing BOps with those. The BOps multplayer is mediocre and a huge step back instead of forward from the previous others. The character and environment modeling of BOps is unimpressive compared to Infinty Ward, and the BOps multiplayer maps & environments are repeditive and dull. They all kinda look & feel the same, with the possible exception of Jungle. The gameplay is simply not as fun either. They handled the \"noob-tube\"ing problem, but having to purchase attachments & guns is lame, the Killstreaks are awful (not even roaming attack dogs can save it), the perks are boring and uncreative (where's the creative improvements?), the knife melee used to be hell of fun but now is inconsistent and sketchy to use, unlocking a huge creative variety of call signs in MW2 was a big fun improvement-well that's gone replaced with having to purchase uninspired unimpressive call signs (as well as Contracts? Blah). The whole game seems and feels rushed and the fun details of MW & MW2 are no longer there. I read somewhere that CoD screwed over Infinity Ward, not that that really matters to me but the gameplay and fun factor with the new Triarch (or whatever) is a definte step backwards.

The single-player finally has a story that you can follow, the multiplayer is MUCH more balanced and the zombie mode is a lot of fun as always.The single-player is quite a thrill for history geeks like me. While it's definitively fiction it's fun to see such important and famous historical figures in a game. As always the CoD series pride itself on variety and Black Ops is no different, containing many entertaining set pieces. There are 2 or 3 places where things might get frustrated but overall it's the most consistent experience so far mainly due to the story. The story makes it such that even in times where you would get bored in previous iterations, the story will drive you forward and make it a bit more interesting and the \"here's an area go shoot someone\" sections has some minor interactions that keeps it interesting similar to how Uncharted 2 does it (although just not as good).Online multiplayer is now much easier to get into for regular people. You now have the ability to chose the guns to your liking much faster thanks to the currency system. Additionally, the kill streaks does not count towards other kill streaks and overall the kill streaks are not as widespread or overpowered as previous CoDs. This means that if you get the RC Car (3 kills), the RC Car kill won't count toward your next kill streak (say the ones requiring five kills). This means you need to actually SHOOT five people to get the 5 kill streak. This makes it so that the map is not filled with kill streak bonuses. As for bugs and freezing, it does happen but not that frequently. I'll say it might happen every 3 hour or so, so if you're really hardcore then sure it matters.I haven't played zombie mode a lot but overall it's fun and entertaining.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "There's always going to be the vocal haters", "unixReviewTime": 1294272000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2011"}

The control i have over customization, from the perks, attachments and equipment far exceeds what MW2 had to offer. There's more flexibility, and the level of customization really puts you in control. I like being able to spend some cash on the items i want when they become available, and i enjoy being able to tweak them to suit my playing style. Instead of needing to complete challenges in order to purchase certain modifications to your weapons, you merely compete for cash in online play and spend that hard earned cheddar on the items YOU want.Thus far, the online experience has been a blast. There were a few annoyances i had with player health, and in my estimation, under the core setting it is a little too high. I had countless shots that i felt should have been kills but weren't because the player health threshold was so high. Once hardcore mode becomes available to me, i may start leaning more that way where there is a lot less forgiveness. The feel, sound and response of the weapons is very pleasing. The shock response upon striking a target is a nice subtle indication that my shots were on point. The lack of commando/pro is VERY relieving, and close quarters combat becomes more of a game of who ADS first or who's closer for a melee strike. If you miss with a knife, chances are you'll be shot. There is really no room for error there and that adds a lot of excitement and tension. It also removes the likelihood of commando campers as now melee strikes require being far closer to your target to succeed.Most of the familiar perks are still there, though some of them have different names now (final stand is now second chance, for instance). Treyarch added a little flare to the pro versions of each perk by integrating specific tasks that make them more challening to acquire. For instance, instead of just starting out with unlimited sprint speed with marathon, you get a longer sprint duration than normal and must utilize the perk to gain 10 first blood kills, run 26 miles and cap the flag in Capture The Flag 15 times. Doing this has introduced me to game styles and tactics i would otherwise have not explored, and for that Treyarch gets my thumbs up. The rest of the perk pros are equally as challenging and exciting to work towards.Pursuing contracts is fun, as it truly makes achieving certain goals more worthwhile and instead of being just a number under the statistics page, you reap the benefits through cold hard cash. If i'm going to attempt 15 head shots with a particular weapon, i like knowing that earning a couple hundred or even thousand COD points are my incentive for doing so. I would like it if the contract timers were a tad longer but it's not too horrible.Editing player tags is a fun addition, and there are literally ENDLESS possibilities to what sort of creations a player can come up with. Emblems can be rotated, enlarged, shrunken, color swapped, layered, you name it. The sky is the limit here. Treyarch even included an AWESOME library of banners to choose from (purchasable with COD points, of course)to add the icing on the cake. For the first time, your player tag can be truly unique.Honestly though, the BEST part of my experience thus far has been the theater option. When you compete in online play, your matches are actually saved, and you can go back and review them as well as chop em up for rendering. You can view each match from ANY players perspective, and there is an option to view the match in first, third or free camera mode. The possibilities a player can achieve with this feature are endless. Want to review a match and see how others played a map to improve your performance? Now you can. Want to see that awesome game winning kill again? Now you can! Want to create the best damned kill mash up ever? NOW YOU CAN!I haven't spent the time going through single player mode since i'm more of an online player anyway, but if single player mode is anything like my online experience has been, then i look forward to what it has to offer. There is still a lot more to explore in this game but overall i give it a five star and i don't see that changing any time soon. I know it's early, but in my honest estimation, Treyarch really knocked this one out of the park.Post release edits:**Combat training is a much welcomed addition to the game for FPS newcomers. There are several levels of AI difficulty to select from which allow players to hone their skills with each weapon and piece of equipment (unlocked progressively in the same manner as online play) and allow them to better grasp and improve their performance on any particular map. Every map in game is selectable, and players may set up a match to suit their tastes and skill level. The best part about the AI is that they don't camp, they have razor sharp aim and on higher difficulty settings it is as though you're fighting against real, high caliber players.**I do still love the emblem editing feature but some things about it kind of bother me. Layers cannot be renamed, and sometimes you duplicate certain objects which appear on the list with the same name. I've screwed up a couple of times trying to resize or angle a particular layer but accidentally edited the wrong one. We need to be able to discern layers from each other. I would also have liked it if on top of everything else we were able to skew shapes.When I first heard about customizing the look of our character models, I was under the impression that we would be able to edit clothing and such, so I was disappointed to find out that selectable player models were determined by your first perk type, and the only true customization is in the face paint option. A bit underwhelming, but not game breaking. I mean, how often do we see ourselves anyway? There is still the option to add cammo and  emblems to our guns, after all. From the reticle shape and color, lense color, cammo options and ability to add our emblems and clan tags to guns there is just so much to choose from to make your weapon your own. I've seen some cool combos on other players via killcams or replays.**The one true online grievance i've experienced is the horrible, HORRIBLE spawn point system, which has been a thoroughly obnoxious problem since purchasing the game. More often than not when I am killed I can find myself respawning in the same spot consecutively, which usually leads to instant or quick death, or near the area where i was recently killed only to be picked off again. Sometimes i spawn right where an enemy cobra is floating around and there isn't anything i can do except soak the death and respawn again. In some games like CtF there are spawn timers so that only adds to the problem.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing", "unixReviewTime": 1289260800, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "A3UTKY931583ZG", "asin": "B003JVCA9Q", "reviewerName": "D. Elston \"Supersport\"", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "COD Black Ops Review:After witnessing some major hype for Call of Duty (COD) Black Ops (BO), I felt like the game couldn't possibly deliver on what it was built up to be.  I played and enjoyed COD Modern Warfare 2 (MW2) for months.  Not simply just multiplayer (MP) like what seems to be the focus for these games, but also for the Spec Ops and yes, the single player (SP) campaign.  I consider myself a gamer somewhere between the realm of casual, and hardcore (casu-core?).  To me, this means I like to enjoy games for their SP campaigns first before I go online to play with others.  Even though my main interest in gaming lies in being told a great story, COD Black Ops did not disappoint in this and most other areas.Gameplay: 9 / 10The gameplay in Black Ops is simply a revision of what's been tried and true from other versions of COD.  COD has become an obvious annual release date, for which some find to be a bad thing.  However, the gameplay doesn't falter.  The controls feel very tight and responsive, you're given a whole slew of options in terms of button configurations and difficulty levels.  I find that the gunplay, the firefights, and the assistance from bot team members all help me to feel immersed in the games.  As for the SP campaign, I always play through the first time on the default difficulty setting, but then go back and crank it up to super hard (Veteran for COD).  I found that the Black Ops' difficulty ramps up rather nicely.  The Normal SP campaign is very approachable even if you've been away from first person shooters (FPS) for a while, while the Veteran campaign is noticeably more difficult.  On Veteran, be expecting some excellent tactics for the most part on behalf of your enemies.  They flank, they flush you out with grenades, they corner you, they'll take side passage ways (when they exist) and if they get a bead on you, you're a 1-2 shot kill for the most part.  They don't miss much...which sometimes can feel a bit cheap and lead to a set of \"die-restarts-die-restart\" moments.My gripes about COD Black Ops are probably shared by many: there obvious points where the action stopped because I hadn't passed an invisible line.  I can see needing a break on Casual or Normal difficulty, but it seems that on the harder difficulties it would be in order for your team to eventually press forward even when you're not ready.  This would make it harder, but more realistic.  The enemies in this don't follow you very far, so if you're not ready to approach you can just back up into the empty wasteland of dead bodies you've left behind.  The enemies still waiting will...wait.  Additionally previous games by Treyarch (COD World at War specifically) had the issue of infinite spawning enemies until you crossed a line.  Black Ops deals with this for most levels but there are some where I can swear it still exists... In a nutshell the enemy spawning is a bit rocky.  The SP campaign is for the most part 99% linear, with minor variations of hallways that lead to the same place.  It would be nice to have a bit of exploring to do, though I have to say the cut scenes between playable sections are top notch action and have many \"oh snap!\" moments.  Lastly, the lack of a online and/or split screen co-op campaign mode is a bummer, though I can't really see how it would work well given the storyline.As for the MP side of things, the customization is a huge improvement.  You are no longer (compared to MW2) required to unlock perks, weapons etc. in order, instead you're allowed to pick the one you like and buy it with earned COD points.  You earn more points with kills, and also level up your profile.  There are still unlockables which really turned out to be a nice variety of game mechanics.  The perks are for the most part the same (with the exception of 1 or 2) which was rather disappointing.  In reality I anticipated there to be some noticeable differences in the MP options.  The guns, the attachments and perks were for the most part the same.  I really felt like had this been a MP-only game it would have been an extension of MW2 with a 1960's twist.The differences I can think of off the top of my head was a reflex sighting (my personal favorite), the under-barrel flamethrower, the nova gas grenade, one that emulates someone firing on your opponents' map.  On the other hand, the killstreak rewards were about half different.  I like the addition of napalm and the fact that since a 5 killstreak is about my normal max it's a nice one at an achievable level.  The tactical nuke (from MW2) is gone, which never seemed very tactical in the first place, and I being a \"casu-core\" gamer never had a chance at the 20+ killstreak to get it, so no loss to me.The MP is still filled with young teens with racist and/or dirty vocabulary, but that's sort of the norm on the internet it seems.  I would love for COD Black Ops to have included some method of an age check or filter that would allow those of us who wish to play competitively with people who are actually respectful to have a venue to do so.  But such is life.  Additionally, the player level matching seems to be non-existent where I'll be on a team of 3 or 4 newbies up against a team of 5-6 generals.  A graduated level system would have been a great inclusion, one that would let those who are level 10 and under play against others in their same range, and on to level 11-20 etc..  to give those getting started a chance instead of being fragged 47 times before getting to move around.  Just a thought.I actually greatly missed the inclusion of Spec Ops missions from this game.  However, my wife and I both enjoyed the Zombies mode for a short while.  The difficulty on it makes it unapproachable for us as a team beyond the 5th or 6th round.  I enjoyed playing with random folks online and the action is quite intense.  To me, however, the lasting appeal isn't there.  I can only play through the same 4-5 rounds with access to the same 4 guns so many times before it's onto something else.  Perhaps a gun randomizer (not the mystery box) for which guns are the starter weapons, or even a difficulty setting adjustment would have been nice.  Still, Zombies mode was fun for a short while, but I found Spec Ops to hold my attention better.Finally, there are a few minigames hidden as Easter eggs, one of which is very well executed \"Smash TV\"-style game with a top down view in the essence of Black Ops and Zombies mode called \"Dead Ops Arcade.  It's a welcome yet totally unexpected addition; and worth having a go for sure.Graphics: 10 / 10I have heard people continuously gripe about how bad the graphics are; I on the other hand believe these complaints are completely unfounded.  The graphics have a grit to them, but look extremely good.  The gun models (and animations) are fantastic, the character models and facial expressions are also very realistic.  The lip-syncing is also excellent...which means it was never noticeably off.  I found the environments that you walk through in both SP and MP to be highly detailed with great high-res textures and models.  In fact I found myself thinking had I designed it I probably wouldn't have thought to put \"X\" there, but it looks realistic, lived-in and used.  All of this adds to the immersion which is the main goal of gaming in my books.  As previously mentioned, the cut scenes between playable sections are very high action and quite entertaining.  But fitting to this section, their graphics are crystal clear and highly detailed.Sound: 10 / 10While I'm not a huge Stones fan, I did think it fit the SP campaign well and was used sparingly enough to make it feel fresh to the game.  The little heavy metal sections were welcome and indicated \"this is going to be intense\"...which never seemed to fail to deliver.  The weapon sounds make the weapons feel incredibly real and certainly powerful.  The sounds for each weapon are noticeably different and gave me the impression that the sound designers had their work cut out for them.  The SP's voice acting is delivered very well by the recognizable voices of Ed Harris (Hudson) and Sam Worthington (Mason), and Ice Cube (Bowman), Gary Oldman (Reznov).  I found the cast fit very well and gave this game a very high-production value feel to it.  The writers developed a dialog that never felt clunky or out of place as well.  Finally the sound effects of the vehicles, explosions, ricochets, and even voices being muffled through water sounded dead on.  Overall the sound is incredible and really deserves to be played where the surround sound is able to work its magic.Presentation: 7 / 10Black Ops packs some major presentation value as is the norm with COD games.  The action is like being in an over the top 1980's movie, where you're somehow able to single-handedly clean out entire squads of highly trained soldiers.  But the way it's presented lets the realistic part of me agree to just enjoy.  There has to be at least 20 explosions in nearly every chapter and yet it still gains intensity up to the end.  The graphics and sound work come together to assist the story into believable that has been crafted to be woven into the history during the cold war.  While intentionally confusing at times, I found the story to be quite entertaining and well structured.Black Ops takes place in a number of vastly different and unique locales.  I particularly enjoyed the snowy levels in MW2 and was not disappointed in the similar levels in Black Ops.  The voice acting of even the unnamed soldiers is excellent to the point of making you believe the team is highly trained and legit.While the presentation for the most part was phenomenal, I couldn't help but notice some really bad errors, bugs or just sloppy work in some of the closing moments of various chapters in Black Ops.  Unfortunately, these sort of trumped the rest for me, as I couldn't believe how unfinished or rushed some parts felt.  During both of my play-throughs of the SP campaign, I felt that the concluding moments of the entire game, along with those of a few other chapters were all too abrupt.  While trying not to spoil anything, I remember noticing that after having endured some of the most incredibly hectic and intense firefighting during S.O.G (chapter 4), the end of the chapter is just \"BAM!\" Good guys land, bad guys are nowhere to be found and everything's alright.  It went so far as to go from a treacherous battlefield full of enemies to a deserted wasteland in a matter of seconds.  While it feels small in writing, what it takes from the experience is not to be understated.  For all the work that goes into making a gamer feel immersed in the action and letting it all of sudden wrap up in 5 seconds is just absurd and dumb.  In my opinion, all the rest of the game's polish was cheapened due to these inconsistent parts.Another gripe was when Hudson or one of the other NPCs would get stuck in a corner continuously running.  After trying to wedge myself between them and the corner to no avail, it had to kill myself to restart at the last check point.  Lame.While not exactly a presentation issue, in MP the servers were less than cooperative.  I got booted from nearly as many games as I actually got to finish.  My connection was not the issue and I believe it may have been patched within the past few days.  But still, for a game that is 5% SP and 95% MP, the MP should be absolutely shining flawless.Final Thoughts: 9 / 10Black Ops delivers in many ways.  The changes to MP were either no change to something good, or more customization and options to make it better.  I think there's still room for improvement in the area of match making, but I'm only one.  As far as the SP campaign, the story was very interesting and had some overall very high-production-value and memorable moments.  While the feeling of immersion is greedily snatched away during certain low points may have ruined some moments for me, overall the game is a good value if you enjoy MP, SP and find Zombies mode entertaining.  If you're ONLY in for SP, you may be disappointed with the length, but the replay value is there if you enjoy a challenge.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Despite being broken in some areas, Black Ops still delivers plenty of bang for the buck.", "unixReviewTime": 1292457600, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "AIJOU8VST1S9S", "asin": "B003JVCA9Q", "reviewerName": "dozramor", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Overall, I was disappointed with Modern Warfare 2 in both single player and multiplayer modes. Single player campaign was nothing more than a your typical Hollywood action flick with all action all the time. Needless to say, it got old very quick and the story was impossible to follow with your typical unbelievable ending. Multiplayer while better than single player suffered from lame perks that people abused and required no skill to use. Commando/lightweight (i.e. teleport) was possibly the cheapest perk combo in that game. The game also suffered from bullets curving around the corner a horrible spawn system that just turned this game into a camp fest. I really didn't mind the camping because I understood why people did it. I mean who wants to have someone spawn right behind and shoot them in the back every 3 seconds?Enter Call of Duty Black Ops, a game that looked good on TV but based on my previous experience, I was not sure about the game and after having this game for about a week, I can honestly say my apprehensions about this game were valid but not in the areas I expected.The goodCampaign mode is much improved this time around. While it seemed like it would end up just being a non-stop action fest during the first few missions, things really started getting good after getting to the Vietnam missions. The story is written better and is easier to follow for the most part, but the flashbacks can be a little distracting. But I can say for a fact that I really got addicted to the single player mode.Online play has many improvements; first of all many of the lame and cheap perks from MW2 are GONE! This means no more commando/lightweight users, no excessive noob tube damage, and no impossible kills from all the way across the screen. In addition there is no more stacking of kill streaks, meaning any kills you get from your kill streak rewards will NOT count towards your kill streak. Because of this you can no longer sit back and let your kill streaks do all the work if you want to get your higher rewards. I was guilty of this in MW2 but I welcome this change in BO and should help to cut down on camping. This also ensures that the more powerful kill streaks rewards (11 is the highest you can get now) will be a rare occurrence which makes for good balance. The spawning system has little improvement but still people will spawn right behind you, but from what I experienced this game is not as bad as MW2. (ummm, scratch this, see my update at the end of this review)New system for weapon upgrades. Instead of having to get 6 million headshots to get a new camo for your gun or attachment, you now have to buy your upgrades with money you earn during your matches. I love this change as in MW2 I became too caught up on completing challenges to get weapon upgrades which in turn forced me to use a particular weapon for all of my matches and it became more of a chore than anything. There are many ways to earn money, but I won't go into them here.Combat training mode is an excellent way for you to practice multiplayer with computer controlled opponents and teammates with customizable game options like time limit and score. You can select the difficulty level and compete in either TDM or FFA on all online maps. In addition you earn upgrades, ranking promotions just like you would online except they don't carry over to online play. I didn't think this mode would be much fun, but it is and is also a good way to try out and practice all the kill streak rewards (if you stay alive long enough) without the pressure or frustration online.The badWith all the improvements in both single player and multiplayer mode the negatives greatly hurt the overall quality of this game.The graphics and sound are a noticeable huge step back from MW2 and even COD4. This does not look like a current gen game, and people who both like and dislike this game all agree the graphics are not up to par with what is currently out on the next gen systems. Many times I have found myself comparing this game's visuals to the graphics of my XBOX (the first one) wondering which one was better. Sound also takes a step back from the previous COD titles, as I have said in many of my comments, all explosive devices sound exactly the same, and the guns themselves just sound a little bit underpowered. While the graphics and sound issues didn't bother me too much on single player they did distract me on online play when it was coupled with the number 1 problem with this game.....ONLINE LAG.While MW2 had MANY problems with online play, LAG was rarely an issue I encountered, this is no longer the cause with BO. Out of all the time I had this game, I only had two or three matches that lag was minimal and this was at 2 in the morning. The rest of my many matches suffered debilitating lag so much that many times I would just quit the game in frustration because it's impossible to kill someone when they are teleporting all over the screen. Even the menu to get to online play is quirky; many times I had to press the \"Playstation Network\" option on the multiplayer screen multiple times JUST to get into the lobby. Then when I get there the only thing that is guaranteed is a laggy online experience. After the second day of putting up with this, I gave up online play altogether and played Combat training, because I just found online play well....unplayable. All of the great improvements to multiplayer are completely ruined by the lag which is a shame.Single player is much improved but multi-player overall is a huge step back even with the improvements that were implemented. I am glad I rented this game, because multiplayer is what makes games like these worth the cost. But when I can't even play multi-player why would I pay full price for it? I may end up getting this game eventually, but not until the price comes down considerably because unless they find a fix for their online mode, there is no way I'm playing this game online.My suggestion RENT before you buy.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "a decent game but doesnt really add anything speacil to the series", "unixReviewTime": 1297814400, "reviewTime": "02 16, 2011"}

Pavlenko", "helpful": [6, 9], "reviewText": "To start off having played through every Call of Duty and watching the franchise grow ill only briefly compare this title to Modern Warfare 2 developed by Infinity Ward and World at War by Treyarch who also made this title, Black Ops. Ill also be writing this from opinion so if you want to details go ahead and read I wont do much to spoil the story except for the beginning sequence but I also have pros and cons at the top for a quick read.UPDATE: Lately 2 days after release the game seems to be getting pretty sensitive to lag. Its not just a personal problem as Ive talked to other players and friends and they've noticed a down hill drop in connection as well. This is coming from Wyoming so it might just be a region issuePros:1.Story has much more depth/longer play time2.No blaring plot holes like MW23.More character involvement4.Like MW2 past characters return from previous Treyarch games5.Personal opinion-Multiplayer is also better than MW2 and WAW6.Much deeper customization than previous titles7.Large amount of in game options and easter eggsCons:1.Noob tubers still present2.Having to unlock gametypes for online play3.Trial and error moments aplenty4.The brick work in laid for it to go down the same route MW2 fell down5.Update: Camping is picking up6.Random placement of claymores is also getting commonSingle Player: I was relatively pleased with Black Ops single player and found the plot more interesting than Modern Warfare 2 or World at War and while there are some who do not agree with that statement its hard to deny the fact that getting a face and voice to the protagonist helps draw players in. You play the majority of the game as Alex Mason who is voiced by none other than Sam Worthington the leading star in James Cameron's Avatar and the revived Clash of the Titans. The story/game starts off with Alex who is strapped to a chair surrounded by TVs and cables. The only other person nearby is a shadowy figure on the other side of a window overlooking the interrogation chamber speaking over an intercom system with his/her voiced masked. Alex is being questioned about past missions and through this you'll play through a series of flashbacks and occasionally taking control of a few other characters. The plot might get confusing (as it was designed to be) to some but in a personal way I was drawn in faster than any other previous Call of Duty game. The squad you work with and get to know over the course of the game are just as easy to get attached to just like Ghost from MW2. A returning character from World at War was welcomed greatly by me and possibly many others if you are familiar with him or that game. On a very positive note the length this game will take can range from 6 to 10 hrs depending on difficulty making this longer than MW2 and WAW. If you are familiar with the occurrences of the Cold War era this game will be greatly welcomed. The one thing I can be disappointed about would be a sense of deja vu experienced through the game as it draws from the two previous entries in the series. Only a minor complaint but this title has much more depth than previous titles story wise so in the end I would recommend a price drop though if you are buying for just sinle player unless you got money to waste.Gameplay: This will be brief but its worth mentioning this title handles just as smooth as the other entries. Just like any Treyarch entry you'll have brief vehicle sections and this time involving helicopters. You'll have a brief motorcycle escape sequence just like MW2's snowmobile chase off the popular cliffhanger level and both handle pretty much the same. Helicopters are a minor pain to handle and to shoot other helicopters first time around but when it comes to strafing moving targets on the ground or even stationary ones you'll be more than likely enjoy it even by a little bit. Weapons handle the same as MW2 but scopes and sights have been tweaked a bit. Quick scoping has been reduced in online play and some will find iron sights better than using the sights like the red dots, acog scopes, and the new reflex sights. I have been noticed that when shooting a target sometimes it doesn't seem to register  but the guns feel just as deadly as ever.The AI in the campaign has a habit of running up to you to beat your face in at the most inopportune moments making for cheap deaths.Multiplayer: This is where i find the greatest improvement in this title is the online multiplayer. Things have been balanced greatly and certain perks are gone such as stopping power which added extra damage to your guns. Killstreaks are more balanced than MW2 making for less first one to get this many kills steals the whole game moments go away. Its still to early on but one of the reasons i despised MW2 towards the end was the glitching, cheating, and the hackers which were more common than what other people try to say or believe. In a short time the same occurrences might happen but hopefully Treyarch has a faster solution than Infinity Ward. The biggest change in multiplayer is the XP system. You'll still level up but gone are unlocking weapons at certain levels or the wait to get one perk. Weapons still become available at certain levels but you now have to spend credits to purchase. Credits are earned like XP through contracts(challenges) and at the end of each game. Contracts work like challenges but need to be bought with credits and only have a limited time to complete the contract. Customization is much more expansive than previous titles where you'll still have to buy attachments as well though. The one complaint I have is the levels to unlock specific game types is rather annoying. There are a multitude of options for this game making it one of the most engaging online games yet.Combat Training: This is now a much welcomed feature that the only other game Ive played that included such a feature was UT3. Combat Training takes place in simulating online play with adjustable difficulties and AI controlled opponents and allies. While  you'll have separate loadouts than what your actual online character is you can easily use combat training to practice, warm up, or test new weapons unlocked and after purchasing. While sadly it doesn't simulate contacts to help earn credits faster it does allow for testing into whether or not you want a certain attachment or weapon. Also if lag is being a bother simply load up some combat training and run through some practice matches on all the maps to learn their layout and in the end this is a valuable addtion to such a game.Theater: This doesn't require much description due to the fact it simply allows you to view past online matches and record or take screen shots.Zombies: The zombies are back and this is without a doubt one of my favorite features in game that just feels well polished and easily done. I wasn't to much of a fan of WAW's Nazi Zombies but with Black Ops the feature is much more refined and well polished than the previous entry. You start the game out with one map but after completing the campaign you get access to a pentagon level featuring Castro and Kennedy and two other American icons as playable survivors.A third level is an overtop camera allowing for an arcade version of zombies that would normally cost around 10 dollars to download. Its easily now one of my much preferred experiences in gaming to date.Overall:ON A SIDE NOTE WAIT FOR THE CREDITS TO END.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Arguably one of the best shooters out there.", "unixReviewTime": 1289347200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2010"}

Yet again, when you compare it to the crap Treyarch tried to push down video gamers' throats, I pitty that they tried so hard to make this game look all \"badass\" and \"fun\" yet, let's see if that's really the case.GAMEPLAY & CONTENTCampaign & StorylineLet's start with the campaign's gameplay and the storyline which is just techniquelly a joke. A plain old joke. The storyline is nothing more than a conspiracy, where you play as a brainwashed agent who can't remember crap. I like how Sargeant Viktor Reznov and Dimitri Patrenko from World at War makes appearances on Black Ops; certainly suggesting Black Ops to be a sequal and counterpart to World at War. Yes, but what ruined that is the fact that Reznov doesn't even exist half the game, again; simply because that the dude you play as can't remember crap. When you discover this, it's really depressing since he was one of the best characters. Yes we all love how it's all \"badass\", but that just comes from the fact that the storyline is nothing more than you doing a bunch of stunts and more of just a bunch of guys shooting at each other. There is no tactics in this game, unlike titles like Battlefield: Bad Company 2. The Call of Duty storylines are designed for war, and epic battlefields. Treyarch ruined the whole storylines by turning it all into a conspiracy, and half the missions are a result of a flashback. Well, overall the campaign is fun and worth playing. Seeing John F. Kennedy and Robert McNamara is pretty cool, yet obvious since this is in the Cold War era.Online Play & Game ModesThe fact that there's \"new\" stuff doesn't really make it funner. But again, let's start with the good stuff. The Wager Matches were a big hit, and those are for the really competetive players. Choosing different outfits were new addition; yet again, very useless. Since it doesn't effect on which team you're on. Now but putting your own emblems on weapons is nice and all. Face paint is pretty bad ass, I have to admit that. The use of COD points is another +1 because buying things is better than unlocking perks and weapons you don't want. The RC-XD Cars are one of my most favorite kill streak rewards. Choosing kills streak rewards is also here, that was from Modern Warfare 2. So now let's get on with the bad stuff, when it comes to Treyarch's games; there's alot of them. That's cool they added split screen online, yet; whatever happened to split screen on campaign? Go back to any former Call of Duty title, like Modern Warfare 2 and you'll find it on there. Treyarch said that Black Ops would be like a combination of all Call of Duty games, apparently with this blunder that's not the case. For the online play, they took out many good perks. Like the perk that allowed you to have 2 primary weapons, and to switch classes at any time. I don't know what happened to those either. Quick-scoping was taken out, because Treyarch apparently found it \"stupid\". It's here in Black Ops, but it is just that, \"stupid\" and useless.Zombies & ExtrasI'm impressed by the way Treyarch modified the Zombie mode, and now you can play as Cold War political figures, John F. Kennedy, Fidel Castro, Robert McNamara and Richard Nickson. This is in the \"Five\" zombies map as you fight zombies in the Pentagon. And I have to admit that being able to unlock this map via cheat codes is a +1. But however, a -1 would be the Kino Der Toten map. It's a good map, bigger than Five. It's great being able to play as World at War characters, but they should have included weapons from World at War as well. They also changed the sound effects of the MP40 German submachine gun, which ruined the authenticity of Black Ops' sequality to World at War. They didn't even include the PPSh-41 Russian submachine gun, which was in the campaign. That too, they also changed the sound. Something similar to spec ops from Infinity Ward's Modern Warfare 2 would have been nice as well. A combinations of spec ops and zombies on the same game would have made Treyarch's claims of a \"unity of all titles\" game true. But overall the zombies is very fun, and worth playing as well. Yet; again, it could have all been better.GRAPHICS & IMAGESSpeaking graphic and imagewise, Black Ops is crap. The fact that you're playing PS3 (known for good graphics), doesn't make the fact that Black Ops has good graphics. Just to truly admit the graphics suck. They aren't as good and sharp as graphics fromModern Warfare 2. Overall, the game just looks like \"crap\". Even if it did have good graphics, it still wouldn't look good. In fact, in terms of graphics this is one of the least good graphics games I've seen. I only like how this time, Treyarch doesn't make the playershands look so small and puny like they did in previous titles likeWorld at War, Call of Duty 3 and Big Red One. One EXTREMELY annoying thing is that EVERY SINGLE F***ING time you switch menus, they just GOTTA show these annoying clips from the game over and over again, I guess they do this just to make the game look all \"badass\", and to truly tell you - they FAIL AT IT. WE GET IT Treyarch. So there you have it, the graphics are just a pure mess.Especially on the Nuketown and Hanoi map. The graphics on there are just horrible.THE REPORT SYSTEMThis report system is a -1. Well some of you may be saying it's a good way to report hackers and cheaters but all I see happening is the abuse of this system. You do not know how many players I knowgot banned by Treyarch from PlayStation Network for no reason. They weren't even hackers or cheaters or anything. Just innocent players. Let's put it this way, the report system is like going on a \"witch-hunt\" on PlayStation Network. Anybody can accuse and report anybody, and they actually get banned. They don't even tell you why you get banned or deranked. My cousin got deranked first. Then account banned. Then console banned ALL FOR NO REASON. \"Offensive language\", give me a break. Anybody can sit there and cuss their asses off and it's never gonna stop, it's pretty simple. There's a lovely thing called a \"mute\". Who cares about their username or emblem? If it was racist or government-threatening that's a whole other story. But truly, the report system is really useless. What's worse is they don't even catch the right people. There is still hackers on PlayStation Network, and Treyarch doesn't even lay a paw on them. How sad. The PS3's security system is NOT that strong as people claim.Call of Duty: Black Ops, I give a 9.2/10 some rating. It's a good game, but it's seriously not as great as Treyarch promised.

I was still so hooked on MW2 multiplayer that I really didn't need a new game, but how could I pass up a new Call of Duty? I didn't realize until I bought Black Ops that is was developed by Treyarch vs. Infinity Ward. What a difference. Although significant improvements were made to the campaign mode, Black Ops is a step backward in online multiplayer performance.On the positive side, campaign mode is longer then MW2 with a more interesting story line. There is a good variety of gameplay here. You get to control a number of vehicles and the cut scenes are well done.  In addition to the improved campaign mode, the online multiplayer has some improvements too. The player stats are much deeper, and are represented visually with graphs/charts. Huge improvement over MW2. There is also more customization of your player, with fully customizable player ID (logo), face paint, more gun camo, etc. You can even put your ID or clan tag on the gun. You can also now play split screen online (finally!). These enhancements are all welcome improvements.Unfortunately the spotty performance online makes it frustrating to take advantage of these features. The server performance has been average at best. Connections are often interrupted, games often have to migrate to a new host and sometimes lose connection in the process.  This is very frustrating, especially when it happens right at the end of a match. Although there has been a software update that improved online performance, it is still noticeably worse then MW2. Also, the load times in general are longer then MW2 (main menu loading, connecting to server, etc.).The multiplayer maps are well done. There is a wide variety of locations and sizes. Although I have noticed there aren't as many camper/sniper spots. Most buildings have multiple entry/exit points. This may be a plus though, especially for those who hate campers! Overall graphics are OK, but not as crisp as MW2.Another weakness is in the weapons dept.  I have yet to find a really accurate auto assault rifle, comparable to the ACR in MW2. Most of the auto assault rifles kick back, making them poor for mid-long range shots. There are some cool guns, but overall I think MW2 had a better selection.The bottom line is that Black Ops does some things better then MW2, but it is just the small stuff like stats, campaign mode, etc. The important stuff, like online multiplayer performance, weapon selection, graphics are worse then MW2. And that is a step backwards. If Activision is smart, they will give Infinity Ward the contract for the next Call of Duty game. It will be interesting to see where the franchise goes from here.If you like the COD series, you'll like Black Ops, but just don't expect it to be better then MW2, because it isn't.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fun but disapointing", "unixReviewTime": 1291593600, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2010"}

COD has been drifting away from reality(which is OK), the developers have admitted taking cues from the world market(non-Americans), especially the Arab market (which is fine), but they mistakenly thought this meant needing to remove any attempt at moral authority of the main characters.This started in MW2 and continues in this.  This is not a good lesson to American children and a dangerous message to other cultures.  American values about freedom and moral responsibility do matter and are universal.Minor Problem3.

Some people are still stuck on the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 phase. But, it's time to move on to newer, albeit, similiar things, and Call of Duty: Black Ops is just that! First, instead of going on a malicous rant about the game, remember that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was a Infinity Ward production while Call of Duty: Black Ops is a Treyarch production. Therefore, the titles, though they have similiar features in most aspects of gameplay, are, in essence, two different games. Players no longer have the ability to lunge twenty feet forward toward their enemies, nor will the scavenger perk work for you noobers; moreoever, there aren't nukes for you so called nuke-boosters; finally, camping is made difficult due to the circularity of the maps in Call of Duty: Black Ops.But, I cannot deny it. I am and always will be a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 fanboy.Pros and Cons (Call of Duty: Black Ops):Pros:(1) I ought to start off by saying that the great thing about multiplayer is the ability to jump into a room with a friend without having to wait for an invitation (if it isn't a private match).(2) Gamers can now customize their characters, including the guns and the emblems.(3) Everything has to be purchased, sometimes unlocked before being purchased, for use. This includes killstreaks and perks. This makes the effort of buying new guns with new attachments, in my opinion, better than unlocking them by leveling up (Like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2).(4) As I mentioned above, the maps, though linear in direction, are circular in the entirety. Therefore, campers are bound to keep moving to protect themselves, increasing the probability of being killed.(5) The guns are, to say the least, done fairly well and tend to recoil a lot. I put this in the pro section of my multiplayer summary because you have to earn a kill. That means, no more no scoping, quick scoping, no more drop shots, and the like. Gamers no longer have the advantage of quick scoping. Call of Duty: Black Ops did away with it.(6) Theater mode is very entertaining. Being able to see your progress in a previous match is a plus. You can also see another players actions by rotating your camera using the R1 and L1 buttons.(7) Combat mode is perfect for those newbies who are virgins to the Call of Duty franchise. Also, veteran Call of Duty players will find this mode as a way to garner or cultivate their skills.(8) Wager matches are profoundly entertaining! Whether its rotating a cycle of guns, getting a new gun with every new kill, using a pistol, a bullet, and a knife to destroy your enemies, or causing havoc with your crossbrow, its a different, more effective way of earning large sums of money.Cons:(1) The party system needs work. Gamers will find it difficult to connect with a party of three of more to a large deathmatch mode like Ground War or Domination (and other alike). Sometimes, it takes a few minutes to connect, unlike Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 which did it faster, mere seconds. Players tend to get \"thrown out\" of rooms, sometimes, forcing them to rejoin the party; however, when trying to rejoin, the game goes a little haywire and prompts players back to the multiplayer menu.(2) The sound and graphic quality will remind players of Call of Duty: World At War. Now, that isn't a bad thing. But, if it's a new game living up to \"Call of Duty\" hype, then it should have a sleeker look.(3) The respawn system is terrible, utterly terrible. Enemies tend to respawn behind players, even after being killed. Sometimes, after killing an enemy, you can actuall witness them respawning directly behind you. This flaw is the downfall of killstreaks.(4) I personally wasn't a big fan of the Commando Perk, the knifing in Call of Duty: Black Ops will cause some players to bark at their televisions yelling \"bull!@#$.\" It feels impossible to knife people at times.(5) The guns are fun, but after some hours of play, tend to feel outdated and useless. And because there aren't many, you're forced to find a favorite gun instead of cycling them from class to class. But this is a minor flaw.(6) The biggest flaw is being booted off of a match either in the beginning, the middle, or at the end. Let me make this clear: sometimes, during the matchmaking process (the screen which acts as the interval between matches), players are thrown out, followed by a sign which says \"disconnected\" or \"your party is no longer available\" while your buddies are still in the room. This happens during the match and after the match has finished--especially while making the transition from one game to the next.In conclusion, the game needs a lot of work. But, so did Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 when it first came out.

I loved MW2 and I prestiged as well, but you cannot expect a carbon copy of MW2. If you want MW2, then just play MW2 with those $15 map-packs (I bought the stimulus package for myself as well, lol).PERSONAL REVIEW ON THE MULTIPLAYER MODE:I realized many MW2 players are hating on COD:Black ops(BO) because of the graphic. I agree with them somewhat, that is why I wanna give 4.5 out of 5, but it doesn't mean u could give the game only 1 star just cuz it doesn't have more textures than MW2!! If you ever played W@W, you know the graphic and innovation isn't everything for Treyarch; they care more of the gameplay and balance in COD. If you want the innovation in COD, just don't play COD and just pick up a copy of BFBC2. After playing W@W, I knew in terms of graphic, Treyarch is still playing the catch up game with Infinite ward. The heavily modified id Tech graphic engine used in the development of COD4 and MW2 by Infinite Ward is far more superior. That is why many people who ONLY played MW2 with high expectations especially on graphic are disappointed. Anyway, a matter of fact, I was amazed how Treyarch pulled off such an amazing graphic in BO, which is almost close to MW2 consider W@W's graphic was really bad compared to COD4.Well, I believe those MW2 players who gave lower rating simply cuz BO got rid of the following:1)Noob-tubing: scavenger + Danger close perk do not exist anymore for those noobtubers; so players who are not good at aiming cannot kill.2)Sniping: it became so much more difficult due to the fact that BO got rid of the quick scoping. If you ever played MOH, you will know how annoying and over powered snipers are. Especially in MW2, many players want to earn their higher kill-streak combo such as Harrier --> AC130 --> Nuke, that the game promotes campers and snipers. I really like how kill-streak do not chained-up as more kills in BO, which further gets rid of campers.3)Camping and dual shoguning: again there were so many campers and dual shotguners in MW2 that their strategies do not work in BO anymore. The implementation of RC-XD w/ ONLY 3 kill-streak (2 kill-streak with hardline perk) is simply to get rid of corner campers. I love that idea.For those of you thought that BO is just an inferior copy of MW2 with just few hours of gameplay, I suggest you to keep on playing. The multi-player mode doesn't grow on some players until you start the CUSTOMIZATION. The personalization of emblem, camo, face-paint, lens color, and lens will have you appreciate and hooked on BO even more. People who are hating on BO is only mentioning the surface of the game (graphic and sound), and have not experienced the real potential of BO. Those who are complaining about the lag, maybe their internet connections aren't good or do not know how to change their setting to LOCALE. You could change your connection setting to LOCALE, where you get to play with local people in your area/region, which personally helps getting the full bar while playing online. The game only came last week, and patches will come to fix those who really experiencing lags. All online games have lag and glitch problems when they first released. If you remember when COD4 first came out, many people including myself simply couldn't play online due to the infinite \"DOWNLOADING GAME SETTING SCREEN\" freeze. That was MUCH worse than any lag you will experience in BO.NOW, MY REVIEW ON THE SINGLE PLAYER MODE:I finished the campaign in 8 hours and loved every moment of it. The story was intense and creative that it reminded me of the movie, \"Shutter Island.\" Treyarch did a great job. I loved how Reznov and Dimitri from W@W came back in the story, and how you actually get to be in Hong kong, and even in German to get rid of SS soldiers like the good old W@W. For me, I thought the story was much much better than other FPS out there.OVERALL:Call of Duty:Black Ops is the closest thing to COD4!!! which for me was the most balanced multi-player experience. In BO, players actually have to run and circulate around the map in Team Deathmatch, which reminded me much of COD4 and I really enjoy that. However, I know there are many people do not appreciate how balanced BO's gameplay is and judging the game by just the surface appearance. Simply, for me, the gameplay of BO is amazing, fun, and addictive.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great FPS! Very Addictive!!", "unixReviewTime": 1289692800, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2010"}

I was disappointed with the single player campaign, but I loved the multiplayer. The story mode can get very boring and repetitive. (Spoiler) There is a twist in the story towards the end of the game, but it isn't as good as the twists in games like BioShock. The story mode isn't very long and if you are really good at it, you can finish it pretty fast. The game is mostly shooting people like most fps are. There are some moments in the game where they change things up, but it doesn't last for long. One thing I didn't like about the game was that the weapons sound silly. They aren't loud like they should be. The graphics for the game aren't that great either. For a game that makes a ton of money, I wish they would have spent some of it to help make the single player better. Now on to multiplayer. Multiplayer is a very fun and a little of the same from the previous games and some new stuff. Now you have so many customization options. You can design your own player card, customize your class (which now has a ton of options), choose your killstreaks (there are a bunch of new ones), and more. You can now play online by yourself (in combat training mode) or online. In both of those, you can play with a friend with split screen. The only thing is that your friend can't sign into their own profile and will have to use whatever weapons you have unlocked. There are a bunch of maps to play on and there are 4 more on the DLC pack and 4 more coming soon in the next pack. Zombies is also brought back and is better than World At War's zombie mode. The only problem I had with this is that there aren't many maps for it. Only two. With 1 more from the DLC pack and another coming with the next pack. The two maps that it does come with are very good though. They made sure to make the maps big and with their own unique twists to the zombie mode. You can play it on your own, with a friend or online. Overall, the story mode was disappointing, but it makes up for it with multiplayer and zombie mode.

Black Ops adds several features that try to keep the COD train going including more gun customization like putting your clan tag and emblem on your gun, you can completely make your own player card which is choose a background and design your own emblem, unlike MW3 where the titles are almost the exact same as MW2. They also added a credit system, wager matches and when you chose your first perk it is the deciding factor of what your character will look like. On top of that the campaign is actually lengthy and entertaining but doesn't try to be over entertaining like Infinity Wards last two entries. Then the zombies also return and are better than ever also this is the perfect start up game for someone new to the series with the addition of combat training which is where you can play team deathmatch with AI opponents so you can get the feel for online play and the maps without everyone getting mad and yelling stuff like noob in your ear which seems to ruin the experience for people right out of the gate. So really it just depends what you want, more of the same with spec ops where you shoot AI soldiers with a buddy or would you rather shoot zombies with buddies. Do you want a very short and explosion ridden overly exciting to the point that its predictable and boring campaign or a deep very thought out lengthy campaign and the thing that I care the most about: Multiplayer, do you want the exact same game as the one from a few years ago, granted COD online is almost the same anyway but the changes black ops added make it the best COD yet and hands down a no brainer for the COD game to get until we see whats happening this year with the series. To shorten this, lengthy entertaining campaign, plenty of zombies new maps and old, and the best multiplayer including customization, perks, hit detection, weapons and map choice the series has ever seen. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up and just let Modern Warfare slip back to 2009 where it belongs.Also anyone thinking about buying this for there children under 17 please reconsider. What people dont seem to understand is that there is a reason why its rated M for mature. I cant believe parents would buy a game like this for anyone under 17 and if you do dont get mad when your son or daughter run around throwing F bombs and racial slurs everywhere because thats a majority of what you hear online is 14 and under year olds using curse words and racial slurs in every sentence, Video games are not babysitters, pay attention to your kids in general and pay attention to what you buy them or what games they are playing because there are some pretty graphic games out there and they are easy to overlook. It sickens me to see so many young children playing a game like this and there parents thinking that its fine because they can trust there kids and there kids are \"mature\" for there age and everyone elses kids are playing it so why not ect. If you let them play them at least make sure they understand its just a game and parents realize that online gaming is a new social media and people from all over the world and of all ages are on there and alot of them say some pretty sick and disturbing things online, especially when a girl with a mic gets online, also make sure they understand that guns are not toys I cant count how many times Ive heard of firearm accidents in which online shooters and video games in general were the main thing to blame.

Andree", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewText": "Call of Duty Black Ops is a game that I have only held off buying due to the fact that all I hear is \"Stay away!\" or, \"\"This game is broken!\", etc. and so forth. Truth be told, I have yet to experience any of the connection issues, system crashes, or whatever else people are complaining about. Quite frankly, I experience fewer host migrations on Black Ops than I did on MW2. In MW2, I had times where there would be 4+ host migrations in one game. But such doesn't seem to be the case with Black Ops. And for complaints about graphics, graphics don't make a game. If that were the case, I would only be playing Killzone 2 right now... but I'm not.One huge perk that I never knew about is the ability to bring a guest online with you. I remember how much fun it was to go to my friend's house in the early days of Halo and split-screen online. It adds a lot of value to the game. I just tried this out last night, and its pretty cool. It beats doing local split screen matches, where screen peaking runs rampant. So this is a nice, fair way to play a FPS with a friend at your house.Now I will list a few of the other cool things I have noticed about the game. Combat Training mode allows you to play online, but with bots. Those bots use the PSN names of your friends. This gives you a good opportunity to get a feel for the maps and guns. This will for sure save you from getting absolutely destroyed in your earlier matches. Guns seem to be a lot more balanced this time around. No more longshots with SMGs, or shotguns. Those only work in CQC, as they are supposed to. You no longer have to unlock every single attachment to get extended mags if you want them on a gun. You simply purchase the attachment with Call of Duty points (the entire game revolves around these.). This means you can have any desired attachment the first time you use a gun. Kills from killstreaks no longer contribute to more killstreaks. Meaning, if you want the gunship, youre going to have to earn it alllll by yourself.If you still aren't convinced... No more Danger Close Pro. No more ridiculous noob tubing. No more akimbo 1887s. No more quick scoping. No more Commando.Campaign seems to be typical of the CoD series. Short, and exciting. The replay value lies in beating it on higher difficulty levels and finding intel. The Zombies mode is pretty boss. Don't try to play it by yourself though. Bring a few friends to avoid pointless frustration. Lastly, contracts and wager matches add a new level of fun to the online multiplayer. These involve gambling your CoD points in an attempt to win big payouts. Try \"One in the Chamber,\" I think it is a pretty fun game.In closing: this game is really fun, not broken, and currently around 40 bucks here on Amazon with a trade in value of 33 bucks. At this point, if you don't like it, trade it back, and it will be the price of a rental. What do you really have to lose?", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Still on the Fence?

The overall balancing has proven to be exceptional as there is no single \"money\" class to exploit or be forced to use in tough games. The maps are fun, weapons and upgrade system a blast and all of the customization available makes the game really enjoyable.There is a big negative. As mentioned in my original review - connection is a serious issue. Lag, framerate drops, freezes...pretty much any connection problem you can think of applies. Patch 1.04 is on the way from Treyarch to address some of these issues, but connection certainly mars what is an otherwise great online experience.***END UPDATE***I'm about 42 hours into the game. I would consider myself a hardcore-console gamer (if there is such thing). I logged 25+ days on MW2 and have spent time with BFBC2, Killzone2 and pretty much every other game that involves shooting other people in the face - online. The review is aimed at people who may have been turned off after MW2.Campaign mode - I wouldn't know cause I don't play it. I hear it takes 6 hours, so probably just a rental if that's all you're interested in.Online* The fixes - noob toobing, commando, stoping power, one man army, boosting, tactical insertions, stacking killstreaks, explosive radius nerfed - ALL GONE. If that means anything to you, then you already love this game.*The Mechanics - best in the console market. Period. The guns are NOT all the same. No more UMP45 across the map kills. It also requires more hits to get a kill. This is good and bad - see connections below.*Graphics/Sound - The maps look phenominal, but the player models are mediocre. The music ambient sound effects are great, but I'm not impressed with the sounds of the guns.*The Maps - my first impression is that they are amazing...BUT... and this is one big but - they are not sniper friendly. I'm not a sniper, so I don't care, but I have some friends that already hate the game becuase the wide open lanes in MW2 are non-existant. There are varied levels, tunnels, etc. - but camping just seems much more difficult.*Connection - still P2P, no dedicated servers, and that sucks. Ultimately, regardless of skill level, connection will be the deciding factor in your enjoyment of the online game (also why I give it four stars)*Wager Games - also known as online crack. Being able to wager your money (which is required to purchase the items you've unlocked and their attachements - it's not automatic anymore) is like playing poker online. There are multiple game types, all very new and add a whole seperate dimesnion to online shooters. Definately the best innovation for FPS's in a long time.*Split Screen - for all online modes is awesome. I have 2 PS3's in the house and can accomodate 4 players with them in an online match. It's about time that option was available.Overall, this is a must buy if you are a COD fan. If you were turned off by MW2 - which many were, and rightfully so, at least give it a try. The Zombie mode, Training mode and wager matches are a blast and give everyone a shot at having a good time - not just experts and 12yr old, foul mouthed racists.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The First Person Shooter Evolves...Finally ***UPDATE***", "unixReviewTime": 1289347200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2010"}

The gameplay has become a bit dated while the graphics look just about the same as in COD4.  For the three console owners who have not experienced COD before, this game will blow them away.  For the other millions of people, it may look a lot like COD4, a game that came out about 4 years ago.  Treyarch did a lot of good things with Black Ops, but lip stick can't make this old game look new.Pros--For players who have not played Call of Duty before, the graphics will seem great, the gameplay will be intense and innovative, the single player campaign over-the-top drama, and multiplayer will keep them busy late into the night.  Let me emphasize that this is for players who have not played COD before.-Game balance on multiplayer is greatly improved from Modern Warfare 2.  Seldom do you see people running around with knives, noob-tubing, or instant ducking/shooting.-Split screen multiplayer makes it a bit more social of a gameCons--No matter whether you play the single player or the multiplayer, you will feel like you've done this all before.-The single player will seem to drag quite a bit and not seem very satisfying.  It is probably as good as COD4, COD5, or COD6's single player story, but by now, they all seem a bit tired.-Multiplayer, while improved, again seems a bit old.  Sure it is not as frustrating now, but it sure seems a bit tired.--Update--I've noticed a lot of disc reading noise coming out of the PS3 lately when playing this game.  It happens a lot during multiplayer games.  It is annoying and I have no idea how much damage it is doing to the hardware.  Google Black Ops PS3 noise and you will see a lot of people complaining about this issue.  Definitely avoid getting this game at least for the PS3.

After a few days playing the campaign and spending crazy amount of hours in the multiplayer, I have to say, this is my favorite game online right now.

The campaign was the longest of the series, or at least it felt that way. The maps!! I really like the maps. The are closed quarters, and has open field areas. They feel just right specially Cracked (my favorite) and Summitt. I think if you give this game a chance, play it for a few days it will start growing on you.

It was fun at parts, funky at others (zombie-killing was a bit out there for co-op mode), and frankly difficult enough at parts to not be fun.  It just felt like the creators knew they'd made just about a perfect FPS game in COD MW2 that they wanted to throw something out there to continue riding the wave of success.I give it two (for fun) and three (for overall) stars because it was a standard \"ok\" FPS game.  I didn't hate it, but it did not feel like it was at all worth the price.  It felt like it was cheaply/quickly made to sell, which they succeeded in doing if one looks at the sales figures.  I look at some of the positive reviews and wonder if people are just giving five stars out of some sense of loyalty to a franchise they love.  I prefer honesty, which is why I gave the PS3 Medal of Honor game a lower score, even though I love that franchise.I won't even go into a \"why do they create video games with the primary purpose to be for online gamers???\" rant.  I tried it briefly and it was not fun.  16 year olds shouting racist things at 12 year olds, constant disconnecting from matches, unoriginal smallish maps, getting annihilated constantly by people who I guess do nothing else with their lives then play online gaming 24/7.To note: I did not have any problems at all with any OFFLINE aspects.  There was no freezing, lagging, or anything else, it all worked fine.The plot had a good overall sort of loosely based on history feel, which I liked probably most about this game.Bottom-line: This game felt contrived and designed simply with the mindset of making money more than being actually fun.

I doubt that a lot of people would argue against that assertion. It's a game that has everything that made Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2 great: Incredible scripted events, tense moments, an intriguing story and awesome weaponry. All that said, Call of Duty: Black Ops suffers from something that few other games are lucky enough to suffer from, it has the problem of having to outdo its own previous iterations. In my opinion it does this and does it quite well.Story:The game this time around takes place during the Vietnam war but you're not on that particular battlefield for very long. The story takes you into the shoes of several different soldiers and as that disembodied camera that posses different soldiers you're globetrotter that goes from Cuba to Vietnam, Washington DC to Russia and quite a few places between that. This is both a blessing a curse. Of course it's very cool to see a wide variety of environments and have the opportunity to snipe from a snowy mountain one minute and take out a camp in the swamps in another, but at the same time, switching from one character to another in different places kind of kills the flow of the story to the point where sometimes it's difficult to understand (or care) what's going on.Weapons:Given the time period weapons are very similar to the ones found in Moder Warfare. the most notable new weapons are the Crossbow and the flamethrower, both are pretty fun to use in single player, though the flamethrower has a pretty short range and enemies tend to attack in packs. In multiplayer they are usually not the best weapons to utilize unless you're one of those guys who is very good at getting accustomed to weapons quickly and can strategize their use effectively. Personally I find the Crossbow to be too slow to reload and the flamethrower too limited in range.Multiplayer:A lot of people by Call of duty and Halo games just for the multiplayer, I'm not one of those people so my opinion on this is kind of slanted. I'm not awful at multiplayer but I'm not consistant by any stretch of the imagination. I've gone from one game having a 21/5 (Kill/death ratio) to having a 6/19 (k/d ratio.) The maps are pretty varied and there are of course the usual camping spots that people generally overuse but there is often a way to get around them without too much trouble. spawning can be problematic at times since the game isn't beyond having you respawn next to an enemy in the next room but, at least in my experience, does not happen all that often.The newest thing to be implemented into multiplayer is that you no longer need to level all the way up to have everything. with every kill, win or contract fulfilled you get money. With that money you can by guns, upgrades, layers to make emblems (which you can put on your guns,) etc. This is a pretty neat addition as now when you can presumably make your best combinations earlier on. The whole customization aspect of the new multiplayer is a welcome change that shows that the franchise is moving int he right direction. Hopefully the next CoD will expand on this even more.Verdict:Call of Duty: Black Ops is a good game. What keeps it from being a fantastic game is weak character development leading to little intrest in the characters themselves and at times a confusing plot in single player. Multiplayer is multiplayer, it's as good as we've come to expect from the franchise (zombies included) with some welcome customization options that add a whole new element to the hectic battleground.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "If it ain't broke. . .", "unixReviewTime": 1291075200, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2010"}

Sometimes, noticeable lag.-Aiming is off at times.  You can have your site in the chest of the enemy and miss.  They can shoot 6 foot to the left and kill you. (seen through killcam). Therefore, aiming and killing can be very random and frustrating.  You are constantly say, \"I killed him\".-Forget games like Headquarters as a good team will simply monitor spawn points and continually kill you.-Introducing COD cash has basically eliminated the need to level.  If you use the M-16, it can be fully customized VERY early in ranking thus making gaining levels pointless.Therefore, for all the reviews that say this is great (referring to Multiplayer) are not being objective as this game certainly has MANY flaws.

I have not touched the single player or nazi zombie modes. I will start by saying that this game has or had depending on how you look at it, now a month after release, to be quite good and the best call of duty game since cod 4. However the ps3 version of the game is virtually unplayable at the time of writing this. The big problem with this game is that the framerate is very inconsistent in most of the multiplayer maps. sometimes it will be running quite smoothe, and then all of a sudden, or in certain area of maps the game becomes a choppy mess. This issue is not a connection issue, I have verizon fios internet and get a full 4 bar connection in this game. This is very disappointing as all previous call of duty games(or at least the ones made by infinity ward) perfomed very well at a constant 60 frames per second. After playing a couple of rounds on modern warfare 2, and then going back to this, the difference is very apparent, for a game that is all about quick reactions, the framerate issues make the game unplayable for me. As of right now Treyarch has yet to even acknowledge that the ps3 version of the game has framerate issues, instead they focus their patches on minimal things like map glitches.

Mullins", "helpful": [1, 5], "reviewText": "There is no way not to compare Call of Duty Black Ops to the excellent Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. The later has become the game that all current FPS are judged by, more so member of the Call of Duty family. I had spent an unhealthy amount of time playing Modern Warfare 2 and so comparing the two as I played through Black Ops was second nature. I will admit I was less than thrilled to hear that Treyarch was developing Black Ops, since the last two CoD games they made (CoD3 and World at War) were my least favorite of the series. For the most part all that worry has been set aside, Black Ops is a great FPS and a great new addition to the Call of Duty line of games.The game plays very much like all post Call of Duty games, good tight controls and fast paced shooting with some story to tie it together. If anything the one thing that dissappointed me the most was the rather odd and somewhat boring story of the game. The mission levels and settings a varied to an amazing degree, Vietnam, Russia, Cuba, etc and span several decades of the Cold War. Yet the story that ties it together seems something out of a cheap spy thriller. While most people will not be bother by this I expect all games at this stage of video game history to have a decent story and a certain amount of polish. The CoD formula is a very linear game with set piece scenes and so the story and presentation are what really makes you feel like going on to the end. The story wasn't bad, but I think they could have told it much better. The interation they have implemented is very nice though. During many scenes you will still have buttons to press and things to do, from starting the engine of your SR71 spy plane to rappelling down mountains, I think that was a nice touch.As I mentioned before the missions are extremely varied in setting, from jungle to snow and everywhere in between. The voice acting is all very good and the graphics are amazing. I remember just looking at the reflection in the canopy of a helicopter you pilot and thinking 'wow nice touch'. The weapon, an important element in all shooters, are varied and interesting. They did a good job of putting lots of gun in the game, while helping them to feel unique and different from each other. The realism isn't great, many of the weapons were not around during the time frame the missions were based on. There are other small details like the Troy folding sights on the weapons facing the wrong direction and the like which bothered me, but its something most people wouldn't pick up on and doesn't really take away from the game.The campaign is rather short but not terribly so and its worth a couple play through. And while the story is somewhat short Treyarch did a wonderful thing by adding a zombie game as well. That was a major hit with their WaW game and I was glad to see it not just returned in Black Ops, but improved as well. It also adds a lot of value and replay to the game. Multiplayer is good and the ability to outfit your kit and weapons again is good.Multiplayer is very good. The maps are well laid out and fun, they seem somewhat camping resistant as well. The weapons are different and the mods are nice. Their are a number of types of online games to play and the option to play split screen or LAN as well. You can set up multiple custom classes so you can switch on the fly. There is also the option to play alone again AI enemies, which allows you to practice. The AI is quite good and on all settings they seem to be fantastic shots.I was worried about picking this game up on launch day since I felt burned bu CoD3 and WaW before, but after reading some good reviews decided to give it a try. And I am glad I did, Treyarch has done a great job on this game and have vastly improved from their last couple attempts. Black Ops is not just a good Treyarch game, but a great Call of Duty game when considered with the fit of the entire series.

I don't find the COD points very interesting, I don't like that you have to level up to unlock the weapon, attachment, ect, and you still have to buy it. Also, now you have to complete a serise of challanges to unlock the pro perk, and some of those challanges may not suit to everyone. For instance, if you want to unlock marathon pro, you have to play CTF, I hate CTF and never play it, so no if I want that perk to be pro I have to play CTF. Same with Ninja, you have to plant bombs to unlock pro, what if you don't like S&D; or Demolition?I do like that the MP is balanced, there are no more overpowered killstreaks. The dogs are kind of overpowered, but still not as bad as an AC130 or chopper gunner.The one thing I really really about this game is the sound. The sound is absolutely terrible in MP. For instance, the footsteps... you can't hear them. I have an expensive set of surround sound headphones and they are useless since you can't hear the footsteps. The Ninja perk is not even necessary since the enemy is moving in dead silence by default. Even after you unlock Ninja Pro, it just sound like random footsteps, there is no sense of direction.Overall this is a subpar game that was overhyped to be this great game that was going to change the future of FPS.

Am I supposed to attempt to hop across and Commando-Style Knife him?Oh and another thing, Commando(Perk from MW2) is practically built in. I've watched dozens of killcams where the enemy zoom-stabbed their enemy to get the win. That is absurd. Fix that. Why does the PS3 get the short end of the stick? I have learned my lesson.

A short 6 hour single player campaign, some fun or unbalanced multiplayer (depending on which of the Call of Duty games you have played), and some fun zombies co-op. You know what you are getting from the package, but the question is this: is it better than Modern Warfare 2? Is it the best Call of Duty game since COD4? Well it depends on who you are talking to, but I would say yes, it is. The singleplayer is easily one of the best in the series, with awesome set pieces and a great story, with balanced and engaging multiplayer, and spiced up zombies, Black Ops is the definitive Call of Duty game.However, despite the fact that all of these components work, the Call of Duty series is simply stale at this point. Ever since Call of Duty 4 (or World at War if you include Zombies), each game has basically been the same, in terms of the campaign and the multiplayer design. There are a few customization options in multiplayer this time around, but they aren't really game changing even though they are cool. The campaign is also as short as you would expect from a Call of Duty game, and with the lack of co-op campaign unlike World at War, there was some wasted potential.So yeah it has its flaws, mostly because of its staleness, but if you can look past some of these flaws and you still find Call of Duty fresh, then you will be in for quite a fun ride! It is the best Call of Duty game since 4 because of a great singleplayer and the best multiplayer since that game's release. The zombies is also fun still with new additions and some awesome weapons.

And it is absolutely true these games, as a rule, do create the quintessential on-line multiplayer experience.  All others are imitators where this is concerned.  However, I actually got this copy for free (its previous owner apparently did not place much value on it). 2) I am not here to laud the merits of Battefield 3.  I have in fact not played it, and I would have no expectation for loving that game much more than this one if I did play it.  So, given these admissions, on to the review.I will concede good marks for the multiplayer (hence the 3 stars on the fun factor)...however, this game is a glorified (and overpriced) expansion pack disguised as the full package.  The single player experience is just okay at best, lots of style but very little substance.  It is pretty much a nice lengthy tutorial for the multiplayer, which is more appropriately designated as an MW3 expansion pack.  Honestly, I see no innovation or upgrade that would warrant a purchase price over about 20 bucks.  What is most disturbing, IMHO, is the trend this game and others like it reinforce...the radical decrease in quality, depth and length of an excellent single player experience in favor of multiplayer mayhem.  For my 60 dollars I would like a truly complete game that delivers on all aspects, Black Ops is simply not that game.  I truly hope someday more gamers will use their purchase power to demand more from developers, until then I suspect we will continue to be inundated with the hollow tripe of this game and its imitators.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "The death knell of quality single player experience?", "unixReviewTime": 1334016000, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2012"}

But that just about does it.  Its nothing we haven't seen with Call Of Duty before, run gun and shoot em up.  There are a few new twists, like the explosive crossbow and zip lines, but nothing to get excited about.  Too much filler time between missions as well.Zombies is in a way, an improvement from WaW zombies.  Bigger move involved maps, smoother graphics.  Zombies however, is much harder and the weapon selection and upgrades aren't nearly as good as zombies from WaW.  Too much wacked out crap going on like having to run and link the teleporter then run back to teleport and THEN pack-a-punch.  Zombie crawlers that explode, the \"Five\" map is just too hard and spastic, to the point where it is nearly unplayable.  Ascension is decent and if you're a hardcore fan of zombies, I'd suggest spending the $15 to get it, it will provide many hours of enjoyment.  New perks, easter eggs, a lot of great stuff going on, but on the same hand, even Ascension is getting to the point of being ridiculously aimless and crazy.Combat training sucks.  Horrible.  The bots are absolutely stupid on the lowest 2 settings so you have to bump them up to hardened to get anything out of it (and then its still kind of stupid)  can't even play on veteran, the bots all run with snipers and auto head shots, just unplayble.  Unfun, doesn't simulate real game play, won't make you better, just make you angry.Now for the online (since thats mainly what COD is about).  If you want good online, DON'T buy this sorry piece of crap.  Buy Homefront, buy Medal of Honor, go back to Modern Warfare, hell go buy Monopoly and play that.  Laggy, sorry host migration, can't keep parties together, sometimes you find lobbies quick, sometimes it takes up to 10 minutes.  All the cheaters, hackers, glitchers, and exploiters have made the transition on to this game.  Aimbots, rapid fire controllers, wall hacks, everything.  I played 10 matches today and couldn't find 1 without a cheater.  The weapons suck, you are forced to run around with the AK74u with rapid fire or else you will get owned.  The Famas has yet to be patched, 1 or 2 shots and it kills you and it has an incredible fire rate.  Pretty much, run with a 203 or rapid fire because you won't stand a chance in a head to head fight.  The weapon's damages are too screwed up to make it fair.  Hit detection....wait, theres hit detection?  Forget ADS, it doesn't matter the bullet will go where it wants to.  I hoped the First Strike map pack would give something new but they don't just more horribly designed maps that are frustrating.  No fix on the spawning issues yet and everyone still runs hardline, gets 2 kills and you have RC XDs live and in effect blowing up everyone.  MW2 went down the drain, but at least it had a solid server, smooth game play, and some fun stuff going on in it.  Everything about Black Ops sucks, perks, weapons, maps, spawning, EVERYTHING.  I suggest go to Vegas with about $15,000 and hit the tables, because thats all this game is, a gamble.  No skill, just randomly picking and choosing who is going to die next.  You may go 20 and 1 then go 2 and 30.  One day the Commando is awesome, the next day you have to run extended mags and MAYBE 45 bullets will kill someone.  It sucks, WaW was the last great COD IMO and I will never waste money on another piece of crap Treyarch makes.  They should be ashamed of this game and hold their heads as low as possible.

He doesn't play video games, and he certainly doesn't care about keeping anyone on his staff who doesn't share his mindset of market domination.  What he does care about is delivering a quality product that sells well, and that is exactly what Black Ops brings to the table.What you can expect:- A 8-10 hour campaign of Michael Bay explosions and \"Tyler Durden\" plot twists mixed into a diabolical story line- Completely inaccurate portrayal of weapons and technology during the 1960-1970 Cold War- Coop zombie multi-player modes, 2 maps with the regular edition and 4 with the Hardened.- 12 Multi-player maps filled with the quality and level of intensity many fans have come to expect from the Call of Duty franchiseWhat I liked:If you play Call of Duty for competitive online matches, you will probably be dropping Modern Warfare 2 for this one.  Not only is the online game more balanced and regulated than its Infinity Ward predecessor, it has a community of developers who have devoted their attention full-time to making sure the community is listened to. The multi-player is addictive, and leaves much to strive for if you are a long-time player of Black Ops.  Prestige modes now bring you into a higher level of competitive game play.  Wager matches are not for the feint of heart when dropping in-game currency.  The best addition to the series was Combat Training.  This mode allows you to experiment with different perks and kill streaks, without the worry of affecting your precious win-loss or kill-death ratios online.  The recent matches option also lets you look at your past matches, much like in Halo 3s theater mode.  This is a welcome addition for those who want to watch good players which stick out on the leaderboards, and \"borrow\" their tactics for their own play style.  These are all options which the community wanted for their next Call of Duty game, and like a champ Treyarch provided.What I disliked:It's starting to feel like the campaign for shooters nowadays is simply for game reviewers to gawk at, and for casual players to use as training for the meat of the game: multi-player.  While I did think the campaign was adequate, on veteran difficulty it was downright annoying.  Enemies respawn and storm right back to take the position of the guy you just shot within 5 seconds. So if you don't move up, you die.  Cowering enemies can't be picked off from their foot sticking out, or head slightly shown either.  You must wait until they decide to shoot at you before you can fire back.  The campaign really didn't flesh into its own until the latter half of the game, and even then it just felt like a sequel to Modern Warfare 2.  Perhaps when Black Ops gets a sequel (probably set in the 1970s) and Chuck Norris comes into the fray we will see a campaign more memorable, but for now just expect to follow a very linear story line with little ability to deviate from the main path without getting killed.Like I said before though, you don't buy games like these anymore for the story, you buy it for the competitive aspect.  This game literally has something for everyone from the hardcore to the casual looking to jump on the bandwagon of FPS players.  Shooter fans expect the best from their games, and Treyarch delivered a knockout.  You might as well join the craze now, because Activision is going to milk this franchise every year until gamers get bored of it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Great Yet Tired Addition to the Franchise", "unixReviewTime": 1289779200, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2010"}

However with Call of Duty games it's hard not to compare, there is so much to live up to.

The answer of course, is yes it does!Come on! Do we really need to review this game, was there really any doubt! If you are a fan of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 1 and 2 then you'll really enjoy this game. Honestly I enjoyed Black Ops just as much and in some cases more.In a nutshell, the graphics are beautiful, the action amazing and the story is entertaining to say the least. Controls are great and very fluid and if you've ever played any other FPS you'll feel right at home, and if you haven't its very easy to pick up from the start. Multiplayer has been revamped, includes everything that made Modern Warfare great plus fixes some of the things that didn't. My only complaint would be the match making, I wish it would match people more by their skill level and not randomly.It's worth the price and (not to sound like a commercial LOL) if you only buy one game this year, this should be it.Now stop reading reviews and go pick up the game so you can start blowing things up!

Eminem trailer played during the MLB playoffs, NFL Sundays, and Primetime?!  WOW this is a big game release,and a big deal to Activision.#2  THE BAD:  The graphics are noticeably below average, I was dissapointed immediately.  Some report that the game looks better on the 360 than it does on the PS3.  Sure they do look darker and clearer on the 360, but trust me it's not enough to make that much of a difference in the overall appearance of the game.  As well, I played close to 50 games and there wasn't one game that didn't glitch, have a framerate issue at least twice a game, both of these concerns speak volumes.  This game wasn't polished.  I think the majority of us felt the Treyarch team was playing hacky sack for about a year because they felt the game was done and brilliant long ago.  I wasn't crazy about the gun games and wager matches other than the one in the chamber game I love that idea, because your playing these games with these horrible graphics that feature the guns and your hands and wrists all look undetailed.  The RC car is too easy to get and it unerves everyone and takes away from the focus of the game as you can hear it all over the map; and all it will likely kill is one player.#3  THE GOOD:  The player and gun/gear customization is a brilliant move.  The menus are excellent.  The maps are all so different and creative.  One in the chamber game sounds fun I couldn't find it, likely an unlock.  You can set and move your claymore, very cool. Co-op zombie mode a fun diversion.  Combat mode with bots another great idea.  Hidden games.  The game is chock full of content.#4  However, to me the game lacks heart.  It's just missing the drama and intensity of a war themed FPS, it feels more like an arcade game.  As players run by with the horrible graphics... ping! I shot the rabbit, here ducky... ping! with the cartoon-like undetailed graphics.#5  Fun Arcadey FPS lacking the intensity of its three predecesors, but not lacking on the fun meter, as well as chock full of talent.  Normally I'd give a game like this a 7/10, but with all the content smashed into this game and the cool custmization I'll give it a solid 8, more of a fun game than a great game.#6  I sold my copy for $50 this morning and will be going back to MW2 this evening.

I borrowed this game from a friend who got it the day they released it.  He played the campaign for about an hour and then played the on-line multiplayer for a couple hours.  He said he didn't like it and loaned it to me the next day.  And, well, hate to say I didn't care for it either.Now I hardly play on-line.  If you do, this review probably doesn't have much to offer you in regards to this game.  I only played the campaign.  And, quite honestly, I now have zero interest in playing this title on-line after the disappointment of the campaign.Why?  Well...It was just plain cheesy.They tried to cram too many things into it.  Meaning, you fly a chopper, an SR22, operate several vehicle-mounted guns, different carry guns and I can't even remember all what else, but the problem is the way they only have you do each of those for a very short time.  Hardly enough to catch on to it before they switch you to something else.  I don't know, maybe they are catering to people's A.D.D.  I found it annoying.  Not much of what you get to do is really all that fun and even when it is (flying the choppers) it doesn't last long at all.The best graphics / action / scenes are the cut scenes.  Pretty much what you saw in the ads.  Forget about repelling like they showed i the ad and like you do in Rainbow Six.  Yea, you do that once or twice here.It was a very short campaign.  The cut scenes went on forever, however.  There is one part where you have to crawl around on the floor trying to get out of a building in slow motion.  Crap, that was boring and went on forever.Seriously, I understand that we all have likes and dislikes and I'm not trying to convince anyone to see things my way.  What I am saying is that I JUST finished the campaign.  I played it over about 3 or 4 days, playing an hour or 2 each time.  It was a real let down.  And then they topped it off at the end with zombie crap - which I hate.  I see that as a cheesy attempt to do that which you failed to do within the genre you chose, war in this case.  Don't get me wrong.  I can play Left For Dead because I expect Zombies.  Just like I can watch Night of the Living Dead because I expect Zombies.  But sorry, I don't want to see Zombies in a war video game...or \"police action\" as Vietnam was called...anymore than I want to see them in Saving Private Ryan.  Again, maybe you are different.  And note that the zombies are in the \"extra\" at the end, not in the campaign.Also (SPOILER ALERT), the line, \"We Won\" at the end is laughable.  But then again, maybe the folks who play this care not at all about that gross inaccuracy.  Or maybe I was just so let down by the campaign that I'm taking it too seriously.  Either way, it's back in the jewel case ready to go back to my friend.I can say that I really doubt I'm being too critical.  Look at how fast the price went down.  Hmmmmm.And let me head this off before it gets started.  If you're trolling, looking for an argument, I won't entertain you.  Again, this is a review -it is MY opinion- and I tried to give you my take on it.  It is neither fact nor fiction, but merely my opinion and feelings as I just finished the campaign, saw the zombies coming through the door in the \"extra\" at the end and put down the controller.BTW, from the same friend and at the same time as Black Ops, I also borrowed and have played Battlefield: Bad Company 2 (campaign and on-line).  I just put an order in for my own copy of that just today as we keep fighting over that one.Neither of us will be fighting over who gets to hang onto Black Ops.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Campaign Rating", "unixReviewTime": 1291161600, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2010"}

Killion", "helpful": [11, 13], "reviewText": "It seems interesting how much Call of Duty has grown from the original, yet at the same time, some of the mechanics that had made the series so popular are still alive in their latest release from Treyarch, Call of Duty: Black Ops. I'm moreso of a casual gamer, and since I'm certain most of the reviews are by outright gamers whom always get the latest FPS (first person shooter) games, I hope I can provide a different perspective.First, I can say I've played most of the Call of Duty series, but wasn't really \"hooked\" until Modern Warfare came out. I loved the current yet slightly futuristic gameplay of it; the storyline was, for a FPS, amazing. The game mechanics were great. But, I can say I didn't really try out the multiplayer aspect of the series until Modern Warfare 2, which I purchased for the PS3 on release. MW2 was notably geared towards its multiplayer, offering a decent but incredibly short single-player, so I decided to suck it up and play multiplayer, and let me say, I was hooked. There were so many failed aspects to MW2 multiplayer, yet for me, it didn't compete with the absolute wins of multiplayer. It was fun, and it was visually amazing. That being said, its biggest setbacks for me were lag/glitching (peer-to-peer gaming I still don't think is the way to go for FPS), and cheap hacks that never fixed (so, the biggest setback was the lack of support by Infinity Ward).Developer Treyarch seems to have listened to the gaming community, and has made an excellent effort to bring an excellent gaming experience. Here's my personal veiwpoints:*Graphics: Overall, the graphics are still a stunning next-gen presentation, but as many have noted, they lack slightly compared to the polish of MW2. Namely, there is jaggedness in much of the visuals, although I think the scenery settings are more robust than MW2, which was purposely scarce of scenery objects overall. Online is also slightly worse, but after playing for a few hours, its not really even noticeable. Not knowing the specifics, the engine seems to be far more similar to BFBC2 than MW2, I actually think a lot of Black Ops is really an in-between of those two games (saying this will probably get me flak from both communities, but it's just my opinion).*Sound: I thought the sound was overall very good in Black Ops, I love that it asks for your sound setup type. I thought MW2 had \"better\" sound, but it was more theatrical. The reality is, most of the SMGs sound like firecrackers in the game, but its also somewhat more realistic than the roaring \"boom boom boom\" every gun would make in MW2.*Single-player: I don't believe the storyline to be as great as MW, but it's certainly an interesting take, and I applaud them for the effort. The gameplay is good, but you'll find the AI to be lacking, particularly on the enemy side, making it slightly less-than-believable.*Zombies: A welcome addition; essentially worth it on its own, and for being included in the game makes it a great bonus.*Multiplayer: The meat of the game resides here in multiplayer. First thing to note is the small-scale of the maps. Teryarch seemed to want less of a \"campers\" paradise, although there are plenty of spots to take cover in, you won't be running for a minute only to be sniped and have to do it all over again. I think the many places for cover are well suited, and even without hardened perk, bullets can go through much of cover, an aspect I enjoy for being more realistic. I would say people are a little too difficult to kill sometimes, but as usual the \"hardcore\" mode provides a much more realistic representation.Some of my favorite aspects have been the removal of commando and danger close perks, the \"weakening\" of quick-scoping (sniper rifles can still be used quite successfully, even in close combat, but requires more skill in Black Ops), and fun maps (although it'd be great to see more, and some larger maps would be great additions as well).There are several issues I will point out about the game. First and most importantly, while there was much hype about the end of glitches and lag, it still runs rampant in the game (in my experience, the first two days were great, and has gone downhill since). This means its anybody's guess if you will actually hit the person you're shooting at, providing random advantages to different users; some games I can easily skate to a 20+/2 K/D ratio, many of my kills even I'll admit were less than fair, while others I'll be unable to kill anyone, despite shooting point-blank. I haven't had too many issues with disconnections/host migration, but I'd say it's close to as frequent as MW2. Knifing is currently somewhat of a guess/luck as well, as many times I'll see others or myself go flying by the person they're knifing, essentially knifing the air even though the guy hasn't moved, only to wind up being knifed yourself. While there is no \"commando\" in the game, having the ballistic knife out significantly improves the speed and ability to melee somebody.The largest thing I can do is have a \"wait and see\" attitude; I've heard Treyarch is more responsive to the community and patching, so hopefully they will improve gameplay (I don't expect perfect, but sometimes it can be ridiculous how off it is).*Multiplayer Training/Practice: Wow, I wish MW2 had this! Seriously, to me this is such a welcome addition, I just wish I had been able to use something like it in the past. When I first made the multiplayer leap in MW2, I went with trepidation that I would be slaughtered, and screamed at for being a n00b. Well, all those things happened. Multiplayer, for the first time you try it, is very different from an idiotic AI in single-player campaign modes (don't get me wrong, there's still plenty of idiots). The goals are very different, and thus playing is ultimately very different. Well, if you were hesitant to make that jump into multiplayer, Black Ops provides the ability to practice against AI of varying difficulty, some of which I found to be even better AI than in campaign mode (still stupid, but it does the trick, starting off very stupid at beginner difficulty, great for learning).*Overall: The game is excellent, albeit with its shortcomings. I hope they patch the flaws, that will really prove to the lifespan of the game for me. If you are on the fence, new to Call of Duty or online gameplay, this one is truly the one to get, since it has most of the best aspects of the series, and many improvements.I really would give this something along the lines of 4.4/5.0 or 8.9/10 if I could.Feel free to ask me questions in the comments section, I will try to check back, and even update if patches resolve the issues.

Being a long-time fan of COD series, I thoroughly-enjoyed MW and MW2 and felt confident about this game from a single-player perspective. I am glad to say I was NOT disappointed.Being primarily a fan of single-player/campaign games, I found this game to be very well-crafted and well-paced. There is a good mixture of varying gaming elements such as vehicles, turrets, and the typical on-foot FPS action. Controls are slick and smooth as you would expect from a COD title. The plot was actually a pleasant surprise in that it is much more cohesive than MW or MW2; I found it to be much easier to follow despite several twists and turns. Clocking in at around 8 hours, I found it to be just right in terms of overall length; you will find no fillers here, as each mission/stage is designed extremely well.Now for multiplayer -- Having invested many many hours into MW, MW2, WaW, and BFBC2 online, I consider myself not a great but decent, experienced player who is familiar with the variety of games that's been offered out there. After a few hours of playing online, I found multiplayer in BO to be disappointing. Fans of the series are likely to see it as a very slightly-modified MW2. There are some minor enhancements but the overall gameplay is flawed in certain aspects. One example is match-making; when starting out at Level 1, you are required to endure many hours of humiliation by those who have nothing better to do but skip school and play this game all day long and talk trash. Yes I'm talking about the Level 40+ folks. In 10 or so matches within a span of 1 hour, I was matched up against less than 5 players (total in all matches) who were ranked less than 10; this means 90% of the players are far more superior in their perks and weaponry than me, and I stood no chance whatsoever. This is a significant flaw that I cannot understand; developers should know how to match similarly-ranked players together by now. I would rather be kicked to the lobby if there are no players with a rank that is somewhat close to mine (which would be hard to believe given there are always thousands of players online), than to be destroyed by players who make it their life's mission to humiliate others. In my opinion, this match-making flaw is inexcusable, and coupled with lack of depth and variety such as the \"Rush\" mode in BFBC2, I sadly cannot find any entertainment value here.In my opinion, this game is worthwhile for its single-player but definitely NOT for multiplayer.

I have logged 425 hours of online play on Black Ops and after seeing the 3 star-rating on here when games that suck are getting 4 stars or better, I thought I'd put in my 2 cents.  Most of the negative reviews revolve around minor issues that haven't been a problem for a long time or they have been written by Dice fanboys.Like I said, online is where I spend my time but I have run through the campaign a couple of times.  It's short but it's fun.  I like the story and you don't get bogged down with long cutscenes.The online play for me is unsurpassed.  I typically load out with an SMG or AR anyway so the fact that the best selection of weapons are in these two classes fits perfect.  Almost all perks have a counter-perk, if you will.  No one perk has a significant advantage over the other.  For the most part, no one gun is vastly superior to other guns.  It's the most balanced FPS I have played.  The fact that you can't quick-scope in this game is worth the price-tag alone.The COD cash system to purchase attachments and perks is ideal.  On MW2, for example, you had to go out and kill 25 guys with a silencer to get the motion sensor.  I don't run silencer but I wouldn't mind running motion sensor.  I like the freedom of being able to choose my load out rather than having to accomplish tasks with attachments I don't care about.  Same goes for perks.

Garrelts", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "I'll admit that I had no plans on buying or even playing Call of Duty: Black Ops. I only own the game because it was given to me as a Christmas present. The series has it's fans and it's detractors and seems to incite so much heated debate between the two groups. Personally my main reason for avoiding Black Ops was that I felt the series had grown stagnant and offered very little new experiences from game to game. To some extent the same can be said here. If you're reading this review and have never played a Call of Duty game, you'll be amazed by Black Ops. If you have played CoD before then be prepared to take a familiar journey, albeit still a quality one.Single-player Experience:Expect the single player campaign to last you about 7-10 hours depending on the skill of the player and the difficulty level. The storyline is all Call of Duty - a continent hoping affair that takes you from the jungles of Vietnam to the frozen tundra of Russia. The story places you in the roles of several characters but mainly as Alex Mason. The game is set during the Cold War/Vietnam War era of the 1960s. When you start the game Mason is strapped to a chair and is being interrogated by parties unknown. Each level in Black Ops is really a flashback that Mason is reliving.Personally I found the story to be a bit confusing. It's almost like the movie Inception at times - very complex and if you don't pay attention for a moment you'll miss out on a tidbit of important information. The confusion is enhanced with the chaotic graphical presentation of the cut-scenes. All that said the missions are generally very enjoyable and offer a fair bit of variety. True to form, Treyarch vary things up by including vehicle segments that are on a scale not seen before in a Call of Duty game. These are very fun segments that are a nice break from the standard run-and-gun gameplay.The graphics are a mixed bag. I had the chance to play Black Ops on a friends PC using nearly maxed settings and it's a sight to behold. Not Crysis but very, very crisp graphics. On the PS3 the graphics aren't so polished but still generally good. There are occasions where the game has some muddy/blurry graphics. Textures on vehicles for example are generally poor. We all know that given the right developer the PS3 can do much better. But this is a multi-platform game and it does show in comparison to some PS3 exclusives.Multi-player Experience:Let's face it, multi-player is why people buy Call of Duty games. It seems that each new iteration of CoD features the same 5-10 hour single player campaign and loads of attention to the multi-player. The same can be said here. New maps, new Perks, new Kill-streak rewards and new modifications. This time around the name of the game is customization. As you progress through the multi-player portion of Black Ops you'll unlock more and more ways to customize your character. Only instead of solely relying on rank based rewards, Black Ops uses and in-game currency to allow you to modify your character and weapons. It's a fantastic system that streamlines the gameplay greatly.So say for example you reach level 24 (Lieutenant) and finally unlock the AUG you've had you're eye on. In CoD's past you would have needed to unlock the weapons attachments by racking up kills. So if you wanted that ACOG scope you knew you needed to get a set number of kills. That system has been replaced. Now, once you unlock a weapon you have instant access to all of it's attachments as long as you can pay for them. A red-dot sight you say - $1000 credits and it's yours. No fussing with iron sights or any other attachments that you don't care for. The same system is in place that allows you to customize the camouflage pattern of your gun and even create your own emblems that are displayed prominently. It's a fun, efficient and addictive system.Sadly I haven't noticed any new online game modes besides the tried and true CoD favorites. Maps are thankfully very good and offer a nice variety of environments.Online Issues:Before I ever popped CoD into my PS3 my plans were almost derailed by the amount of complaints regarding the online stability of Black Ops. I'm happy to say that thus far I've found these reports to be greatly exaggerated. That's not to say that I don't believe what some folks are saying - just that I've experienced very few problems online myself with Black Ops. There are occasional disconnects and games where the host cannot be migrated but that has been a small percentage of the many, many rounds I've played online.One of my major complaints with the CoD series is the balancing issues that continue to plague the series. There are rounds where teams are simply not accurately balanced thus leading to very one-sided victories. It seems that given the stat tracking already built into the game it would be easy to implement a load balancing algorithm to more evenly split teams up.All in all, Black Ops is another quality entry in the dominant FPS genre. While the game doesn't offer much innovation it does offer very approachable gameplay, competent graphics and an addictive online mode. Good but certainly not great. Black Ops is worth checking out.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Better Than Expected - Online Issues Severely Over-hyped", "unixReviewTime": 1295136000, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2011"}

I preordered this, thinking this would be a new revolution of Call of Duty. Like all the other Call of Dutys... same game, different guns. They made MINOR adjustments by adding the \"currency\" system, which I'd prefer, but it's nothing to go nuts over. Yeah, you get a bit more customization, but the gameplay... exact same. Although, I must admit, it is MUCH more balanced than Modern Warfare 2. However, I found myself extremely bored after my first prestige. It's the same thing over and over... kill, kill, die, kill, die, die, kill, kill, etc. It just needs some.. variety, and Treyarch AND Activision seem to not understand that... but what does it matter? They're making a fortune off of your money. Eventually, people will come to their senses, but here's my ratings for the game.Campaign: 8.5/10- Like many people have said, it's a GREAT campaign, if not the best. There's a great story and interesting characters and those great Call of Duty action moments. However, some parts seemed sort of thrown together and it tends to get pretty predictive. The voice acting was not very intense, unlike previous ones.Fun: 8/10- At first, it feels like a totally new Call of Duty. You'll be excited to unlock everything and show off your tag to other people and what not, but trust me, it dulls out eventually.Multiplayer: 6/10- Everyone buys these games for the multiplayer. They don't want to constantly be interrupted by host connections failures. New players don't want to face a team full of level 8 prestiges, while their team consists of non-prestiged players (terrible matchmaking). The game is rated M. It's not meant to be swarmed with little children talking smack over a microphone. The only reason this rating isn't a 3/10 is because they've got TONS of multiplayer modes, and if you're lucky enough to get a mature group to play with, it can be loads of fun, but that won't happen too often.Graphics: 7/10- Yeah, everyone always says gameplay is more important than than graphics, which is true, but when you have repetitive, boring gameplay, paired with PS2 graphics, it doesn't really help... C'mon Treyarch it's 2010 (when released), those are surely not 1080p graphics like you claim.Zombies: 10/10- I mean c'mon... it's zombies..Overall, this is an OKAY game. Wait for it to drop to at most $30, it's not worth anything more.

This game takes all the strengths of previous games and capitalizes on them while making a few great-yet-minor tweaks to improve the overall gameplay experience. The single player campaign is awesome, if somewhat confusing at times. Chewing up the Vietnamese coast in a PT boat while \"Sympathy for the Devil\" plays in the background? It doesn't get any more awesome than that. MP is awesome as always, I love the in-game economy for upgrading weapons and systems. Lets you get what you want and ignore what you don't. Overall the game isn't innovative, but frankly it doesn't set out to be. It's a continuation of what we know and love with minor improvements, making it overall the best COD game to date. People are too hard on it just because the improvements, at this point, are only incremental. There is NO way this is a 3-star game, as current reviews suggest.

I was getting killed/sniped/knifed every 10 sec or so until she gave me a few pointers (don't be Rambo, don't run around in the open, work with your team, etc..) to which I eventually became better and ending up loving the game.So Black Ops comes out and I figure, hey I should like this too, right? WRONG. Of course, I immediately sucked at it too and hated it in the beginning because I was getting killed/sniped/knifed (this time every 5 sec) but figured I just needed to learn the mechanics of this game before writing it off like I was about to do with BBC2. Well, I gave it a couple weeks but I found myself popping in BBC2 more often than Black Ops so I ended up trading it back in yesterday.Things I Liked: I did like the character/weapon customization aspects of the multiplayer game and the single player campaign was pretty good but very short and very linear. I think I liked and played the zombie mini-game the most come to think of it.Things I did not like: Connectivity issues-I can't be certain that it was the game's servers or my connection but I had a hell of a time getting & staying connected..very frustrating. What really killed it for me was the multiplayer maps..they are WAY TOO SMALL for that many players!! You cannot turn around without bumping into someone and subsequently getting knifed. The 'Nuke Town' map comes to  mind. Also the action seems way too fast which makes it very 'arcade-ish' and ends up taking away from the realism for me at least (not that there aren't issues like that in BBC2 mind you).Anyway, hope you read all these reviews with a grain of salt...no way is this game either a 1-star turd or 5-star Holy grail, its somewhere safely in the middle.

My friends and I got online together and played every for hours...like...30 days of non stop gaming lol. It was highly addictive, even with the faults. With Black Ops, the whole feel is just cartoony and can only be played one way.With MW2, you could run and gun, camp, play with the shield, snipe, etc...In Black Ops, it has completely taken out sniping. Asides from 1 map, every map has the same close feel to it. It's great for running and gunning sloppy action, but me and my friends definitely enjoy the option to sit back and snipe and relax some. The maps are poorly designed in my opinion.Also, every gun is the same pretty much. It's nice working your way up the levels to get better and better weapons. With BO's...the guns are so evenly balances, it takes all the fun out of leveling up. And since you can't snipe...there goes the drive to get new classes by prestiging.Oh, and let's not forget about the perks and the rediculous challenges to get Pro versions of them. Lots of people don't want to play the different game modes...but we have to if we want to complete the challenges to unlock the pro perk. It's just silly and annoying.

I love MW2 as well as any MMO games but with competitive games comes lazy people who want to look better than they are and they exploit the game to appear godly.  In black ops grenades dont kill you as often,  Noobtubing is almost a nonissue.  You occasionally see someone running around with the grenade launcher attachment but its alot easier for them to miss or survive those cheap kills with the appropriate perks.Black ops is for people with skill in shooting, running and hiding.  If you have none of those stay away from this game and go back to MW2.Main story is interesting and a nice little distraction from from the main focus of the game which would be the Multiplayer aspect.Multiplayer is tons better than MW2 mostly because there are 3 types of games you can play in multiplayer.  Basic black ops multiplayer with FFA, Domination, HQs Team Deathmatch etc.  Then two types of Zombie action.  The zombies we all know from World at War is back and just as good and lastly Black ops Arcade which is like a combination of contra and zombies which can be alot of fun if you are tired of the other two.There is a theatre option were you can make movies of recent games you were in and show off your best kills (or your worst deaths lol) and show it off to your friends.For those of you who were godly in MW2 but cant seem to hold your own in multiplayer you can always do the training mode where you pretty much play against bots (the computer) and improve your skills til you are brave enough to take on other people.  But i dont advise this for those of you who are green to the COD series and competitive multiplayer shooters because bots have some serious accuracy and most humans as we all know dont. lolOverall get this game if you love a challenge and want to be interested the entire time you grind through levels.

First off this game has had many bugs in both the campaign and multiplayer games on the PS3.  I don't know if the Xbox had the same problems.  I got the game the day it came out since it released on my birthday.The campaign was just like any other COD game but it was not as fun as MW2.  It probably only took like 5 or 6 hours to complete.  There weren't any sniping missions but I did like the mission with the satellite infrared view while you direct your soldiers.  There were also many times where the game froze loading the campaign also.  I really hope Treyarch does a better job on MW2.Regarding the multiplayer game, my PS3 is one of the few that has a problem loading up the Find Match screen that shows Core, Barebones, Hardcore, or Prestige.  And it is not my PS3 because it has been rock solid for the few years I've owned it.  When the game first loads up, all the choices are greyed out and I cannot choose any of them.  So I have to wait 5 mins before any of them become selectable.  This is VERY annoying.  I'm not sure why it does this, it is not the copy of the game because I even went and exchanged the disc for a new one from Game Stop and it continues to do this.  It is obviously something between my model PS3 and the Treyarch servers.  Every other game that I have for PS3 works perfectly online.  MW2, Killzone 2, Street Fighter, they all work perfect and load up quickly for online multiplayer.  One thing happened however for a couple weeks, after one of the many updates that the PS3 does when you turn on the game. The Find Match screen worked perfect after load up and allowed me to choose Core, Barebones, Hardcore, or Prestige, so you can imagine how happy I was!  Then there was another update a few weeks later, and it went back to being broken again and I could not choose any Core, Barebones, Hardcore, or Prestige and I now have to wait 5 mins again before it becomes selectable.  Unbelievable!!!  And the problem has nothing to do with my internet connection because I have 21mbps on Comcast and like I said all my other games work perfectly online, even MW2 and the other COD games.I don't have to go further and tell you how bad the servers are with \"Migrating Host\" and countless freezes loading a match.  There are hundreds of other reviews that already mention that.  One night I think I only got through a couple of complete matches because each match kept freezing or migrating host.  This is one of THE WORST games for connecting online.The actual multiplayer game is fun however, and I like the new maps in Black Ops.  But I just don't care for any of the guns except the M16, AK47 and Commando.  I've almost completed my first Prestige so I am pretty familiar with the game.  I just wish you could have a shotgun as your secondary weapon, I really don't like how they changed that part of the game.  Also, I think you should be able to re-supply claymores if you are using the Scavenger perk(like in MW2).  There is a risk using that perk because you are visible on radar and choppers can shoot you.  So why not allow you to re-supply claymores from dead bodies??

I have said it before and I'll say it a bunch more in the future, but FPS games are not typically my preferred game.  That being said.....Black Ops was an absolute blast!  Single player campaign  is full of tense action that never lets go and the built-in soundtrack is fantastic.  The only real issue I have with it is the same issue I have with alot of FPS games: story.  While the story isn't a complete wash, I found it hard to really get in to it.  It is almost as if they were trying too hard to make it great.  While it's got some good moments, I ultimately found it far more interesting to skip the scene(s).Online is an absolute blast.  While I never played MW2, I understand that fundamentally it is the same setup with some tweaks here and there.  However, this is the bulk of the game experience and, for most people who want to own this, the reason they want it.  This is also where my biggest complaints come in.Issue #1:  Playing a match is an exercise in both patience and futility.  It takes SUCH a long time to get in to a match.  If this was the only issue, it probably wouldn't be so bad, but when you wait for (literally) half an hour in some cases to get in to a match only to be booted five minutes in or to have the match lagging so bad that it makes it almost impossible to shoot anything; something is wrong.  This really should have been addressed a while ago, but so far I have seen little improvement.....unless you want to play at 3AM (I am typically a night owl so this isn't necessarily bad for me, but if I want to play during any \"normal\" time....it's a crap shoot.)Issue #2:  The reason I ultimately jumped on this game was because I wanted some local multiplayer.  Split screen was fun while it lasted.  Notice I said \"was\".  That is because as soon as I got my patch it began requiring an internet connection to play local multiplayer.  WTF?!  I take my deck over to a friend's house who doesn't have internet.  Basically this makes the game useless to me to play with friends unless I want to hop online at home.  Come on now!  Local multiplay should never REQUIRE a connection.  If anyone knows a work-around on this please let me know in a comment because google searches have been fruitless.  In any case, though, this is a major hassle that may affect only a few of you out there, but it's worth mentioning.  If you plan to locally multiplay this title without internet....make sure you NEVER get the patch for it.Sadly, I consider each of these isues to be \"star-dockers\".  It hurts me to score this game lowly, but these issues are stupid to have on a game that touts its multiplayer.  I will say this though, I love this game and if these isues ever get fixed; this will be a five-star powerhouse.

To that end, please realize that this should not be viewed as a comprehensive review.  I will update as I become more familiar with the product, and if you do not find this review helpful, please let me know why in the comments section.  I'll be happy to address the issue ASAP.Original Review begins here:COD: Black Ops is the third COD game I have played but the first I have owned.  I opted for Battlefield Bad Company 2 over MW2 last time around, but I am neither a COD, BF, or MoH fanboy.  I am also a professional software tester, and while that doesn't lend more inherent weight to my opinions, I hope it lets you know where I'm coming from in a review.  For a game to be enjoyable to me, it has to be bug-free, smooth, and without major play imbalances.  Each of these three types of issues have plagued FPS games, so I will begin with this point -- COD:BO does not suffer from any of those issues.It is the smoothest game, particularly multi-player, that I have ever played.  I have read reviews on amazon from other customers who felt exactly the opposite, so I'm tempted to think that's an internet issue.  I have the fastest connection possible, and I can tell you without doubt that it is much, much smoother than anything else I've played in the FPS realm for PS3 (or even PC, for that matter).Graphics: Really, really, really good -- but not perfect.  This doesn't bother me, even a little.Multiplayer:Good gun balance but a bit of a learning curve.  I'm an old-school PC FPS guy, so I still don't have my stick reflexes worked out.  Melee attacks seem to have minimal \"suck-in\" effect (as opposed to, say, Gears of War) but I do wish the melee attack animations were a little more visually appealing.  I haven't encountered any overpowered weapons yet, which is a huge plus.  This game will *not*, however, work well for folks who like the objective-based squad play of BFBC2.  If you want that out of this game, it isn't there -- at least not within five hours of gameplay.  Maybe one of the unlocked modes will suffice -- I just simply can't say that yet.The unlockable system is great.  It's vastly superior to anything else out there right now.Single Player: Beautiful and engaging from the first moments.  I haven't played very far into it, so I'll leave it at that for now.  Major gaming review sites seemed to think very highly of the story line, though, so I'd recommend checking around for some of those reviews.Training Mode: Honestly, this is a stroke of genius.  Thank you, Treyarch.  Thank you.  You can actually learn the multiplayer maps before you play them now.  This is the most useful tool I've seen included for a gamer because it lessens the learning curve.Critiques: Spawning in multiplayer can be bad.  Sometimes you will spawn in as an enemy runs around the corner and pegs you while you try to figure out which way is up.  The upside here is that camping choke-points off of spawn is virtually impossible (for the 'attacker') due to each map's design.  The maps are smaller than I expected, but larger maps may have been too much to ask for.Overall: I highly recommend this game so far, and I also would submit that anyone experiencing \"frame rate issues\" in multi is instead suffering from a subpar internet connection.  If you aren't a diehard of any previous shooter, this one will do very nicely for you.  If you love BFBC2 and want something similar, hold off.  If you love MW2, you may still prefer it.  I'm not sure what to say for MoH because the critic reviews have been so negative about it that I didn't put any eggs in that basket at all.I'll be updating this review as we go.  Good luck, and God bless!***First Edit*** This game is just crazy fun in multi.  I haven't spent any time in single player due to how fun multi is.  There are issues -- there's no real reason to play with anything other than an assault rifle (famas or galil, usually) except for novelty.  Certain killstreaks are virtually useless against experienced players (planes should be shot down 5 seconds after they're up if you're playing someone who knows what they're doing).  Spawns are as good as they can be due to map size and game style.  You *will* be spawn killed once in a great while.  That being said, it's like crack.  You won't be able to stop playing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Iterative Review: First impressions (updates will follow)", "unixReviewTime": 1289260800, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2010"}

Their last entry gave birth to one of the best mini games in video game history Nazi Zombies. What would this one have to offer? Well plenty of content that's for sure. Let me start out by talking about the campaign.The story is a well written narrative that shows the life of a CIA operative named Alex Mason. You also take over two other soldiers during the campaign, but a majority of the time is spent looking through Mason's eyes. There are twists and turns abound as the story is rather complex for a  Call of Duty game.  It appears that Call of Duty has moved past using historical battles in their games because this one takes a lot of historical privileges to tell it's tale. That's not a bad thing necessarily, but I miss the days of playing historical moments.The level design is rather well done, but the campaign does fail to grab you right away. The narrative has to develop first then it really kicks in gear. It has a lot of intricacies in both story and actual gameplay to be a step above most. The voice acting is excellent, but I do wish there were some more cut scenes to enhance the movie-like feel that they are striving for. The graphics are decent, but they feel like a step down from how good Modern Warfare 2 looked. Your AI brothers in arms are as stupid as they come. They allow enemies to run right by them and kill you while you're reloading. This added to the terrible number of respawing enemies lead to many moments of anger while I tried to beat the campaign in Hardened difficulty. There were times I had to run to the check point because the enemies just kept spawning. I had to lower the difficulty it angered me so much.This game does involve more gore then the previous games as there are many times when your enemies skull is exposed. These moments seem to add some grittiness to the game that really does help the cold war feel. There are many locations to explore in the campaign and it will easily last 6 to 8  hours to complete. There are also some vehicle missions that add some variety. Overall the campaign had a great story, but some technical issues kept it from being spectacular.Zombies is back in this installment as well. You get two maps right on the disc, which is awesome. They both add some new features like the pulse, and freeze gun, along with all the weapons from the campaign. No MG42 in this one but at least the Ray Gun made the cut. These new weapons are powerful enough though so don't worry about killing those Zombies. Also now when you are playing single player you are allowed to buy Quick Revive to revive yourself with four times. It really helps out those people who only play by themselves. These maps are great and I'm going to put a lot of time into them as I know most of you will. They added just enough to keep it fresh while leaving the spirit of the original levels intact.  If you buy the hardened edition you also get the four original maps with the new weapons and updated graphics. The old maps now seem harder so you better buckle down to get to your old high score.Another great add on is Black Ops Arcade. You fight hoards of zombies from an over the top view. It plays like Commandoes on the NES and is a great extra mode that I'm sure they will develop further with the next map pack. Also \"Zork\" the old text based game is included in full. Assuming you can find it.The multiplayer plays a lot like Modern Warfare 2 but has new ways to get your weapons. When you rank up you don't unlock weapons. You gain the ability to buy them using your XP points. It really makes you think about how you spend your money, or you can bet it all in one match hoping you finish in the top 3. I have never used this betting game mode but I hear it's rather addicting.Call of Duty Black Ops is a great installment especially considering all you get on one disc. The multiplayer is tweaked to add more excitement, the campaign is a conspiracy tale that won't let go, Black Ops Arcade is a great new mini game, and classic zombies is back. Not many games give you this much content on one disc. I'm not usually one who puts Call of Duty in the running for Game of the Year, but this time it's worthy of it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Tale of Espionage in the Cold War Era", "unixReviewTime": 1290470400, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2010"}

Lots of variety, great graphics and story.I invited my friend over to play (Local) Co-Op and was really disappointed. The zombie mode wore out on us real quick. And we had no way of playing online with other people because I didn't want to pay for the service.

I cannot compare to modern warfare 2 since I didn't play it online.*if you do not have online capabilities, you might grow tired of the game after you finish the single player campaign and tried a few hours of the different zombie mode levels. (in this regard, I highly recommend Modern Warfare 2 for its 2-player Spec Ops missions).Oh, you can also play Split screen online multiplayer:a friend can come over and join you in the multiplayer games.

{"reviewerID": "AM2CKH3GQRXX4", "asin": "B003JVCA9Q", "reviewerName": "T. Frye", "helpful": [0, 2], "reviewText": "I was cautious upon buying Black Ops, mostly due to my reputation of the original Modern Warfare. I bought the original Modern Warfare a few months ago, and it was decent, but was still a letdown. The campaign was fun, but the competitive multiplayer was terrible, with unbalanced gameplay, and mediocre maps. Since I figured MW2 would be the same (they share titles), I skipped it, and went on to Black Ops. So, was Black Ops another letdown, or was it fun, enjoyable, and balanced?Black Ops is some of the most fun I've had in a video game for a long while, and even that might be an understatement.Not that it's perfect; the campaign leaves much to be desired. While MW1 had terrible multiplayer, the campaign was a blast. The campaign in Black Ops, however, is a boring and bland experience. The story didn't grab me and pull me in like in MW1. After I completed the Vorkuta level, I just gave up on it.None of these problems carry over to the online componet of the game, however. This is some of the most engrossing, action-packed competitive multiplayer on the planet, and it's complemented with a host of features, such as the groundbreaking Wager and Theater modes, fantastic maps, and plenty of unlockable weapons, attachments, camoflouge, face paint, perks, equipment, killstreak rewards... I could go on and on.The variety of game modes at your disposal is staggering. My two personal favorites are Domination (capture three flags. Earn points for holding them) and Sabotage (A neutral bomb is placed in the middle of the map. Grab the bomb, and plant it in the enemy base within the time limit). If these modes don't catch your fancy, you also have game modes such as team deathmatch, free-for-all, demolition, etc.Wager match is another cool feature. After every match, you gain a type of currency called CoD points. You can use these points to buy new weapons and gear, or you can gamble with them in Wager match. There are four game modes in Wager match, and they are all unique twists on free-for-all. One in the Chamber is a mode where you are restricted to a pistol. You start out with a bullet and three lives. You recieve one bullet after each kill. This is by far the most tense of the four, and is as hard as it is fun. Sticks and Stones has you equiped with an explosive crossbow, and knife, and a tomahawk. Tomahawk kills reset an enemies score to zero. This mode is fun, but not quite as appealing as the other three modes.The last two are the best. Gun game (my favorite) has you starting out with a python. With each kill, you get a different gun. Knife kills demote players to their previous weapon. The first person to get a kill with every weapon wins. This is a tense and rewarding mode, and the best of the four. And finally, Sharpshooter startes you out with a weapon. Weapons switch every 45 seconds, and kill streakes earn you perks. Highest scoring player wins. This mode is very similar to Gun game, but is still entertaining.Remember, you're gambling in these modes, so it costs a certain amount of Cod points to play. You can select between low, medium, and high buy-in fees; the higher the amount paid, the bigger the reward.Another feature worth mentioning are contracts. You can pay a certain amount of CoD points to get a contract (it varies depending on the contract). A simple contract might ask you to get two kills from a far distance, while a more expensive one might ask for 11 headshots in a row with a certain sniper rifle. This system is a nice addition, but is ultimately unneseccary.And now we come to Theater mode. This might be the most groundbreaking feature Black Ops has to offer. The game saves every game you play. At any time, you can go back, rewatch a match you played, look for a cool kill, record the kill from either a first-person, third-person, or free camera perspective, save the clip, and upload it to the community to share it with friends. That is incredible. You can also pause time and take screenshots, and view the game from another players perspective.So, I've covered all of Black Ops. Or have I? Yes, there is even more. There is the epic Zombies mode.Zombies mode is exactly like it sounds: survive a horde of zombies. This doesn't exactly fit with the rest of the game, but when it is this fun, who cares? You can buy weapons on the walls with the points you earn for killing the zombies. The zombies grow in both strength and numbers as the rounds pass by, so if you have medical problems when under pressure, be sure to check with your doctor before you play.If it's not the bliss gameplay of the Zombies mode that make it fun, it's the hilarious dialogue that the characters constantly say. The mode is four player co-op, which means there are always four people saying the most hilarious things. Try the zombies mode in the pentagon for example. You have J.F.K, Robert Mcnamara, President Nixon, and Fidel Castro constantly talking. And it is flat out HILARIOUS!!!!!!!I would pay full price just for the zombies mode. I am not kidding. There are three different scenarios to fight zombies in (five, if you count Ascension and Call of the Dead, DLC maps), and each one is massive. Expect a lot of replay value in Zombies.Overall, this is one of the best games I've ever played, and certainly an impressive game. While the campaign is not that great, the multiplayer and Zombies are truly some of the most fun I've ever had. This game is an absolute must-have, whether you like zombies or competitive multiplayer action.PS: You might want to rent it if you are a solo player. This is pretty much an online focused game.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An awesome Zombies mode is backed up by some of the best competitive multiplayer on the planet.", "unixReviewTime": 1310774400, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2011"}

Zombies may seem very difficult at first, since two zombie slapstakes you down, and they can occur in quick succession.  There is alot of difference between the campaign, multiplayerand zombies in terms of gameplay.  The campaign rehashes air strikes, cover techniques, quick-reflex running and gunning,and stealth attacks (which are much more prevalent).  Trearch improved graphics from World at War to be on par with MW2.There's great variety in environments, ranging from indoor, outdoor, under water, under gound and up in the air.The cut scenes are visually apealling, but you can't skip them.  The animators did an amazing job on the Russian, Nicoli,as you can see every wrinkle on his face as he's expressing his war sentiment.  The earlier parts of the story really grabyou, especially while escaping prison.  As the campaign goes on, you may tire of the story, just wanting to get onwith shooting the enemy.  There is an entirely fresh mission.  It involves controlling a stealth bomber for ground support,guiding troops, then zooming down into the troop's shoes, getting the drop on Russians, then killing, killing, killing.There is vehicular combat in the form of pontoon boats and helicopters.  The campaign is playable, and very difficulton hard difficulty.  There is a good variety of new guns, and they have different functions for campaign, multiplayer andzombies.  As always, there are pistols, sub-machine guns, assault rifles, light machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns andexplosives.  A new addition is the explosive crossbow.  There is plenty of ammunition during the campaign, so that's notan issue.  You have alot less ammo to start with in multiplayer.  I found assault rifles with high fire rate and low recoilto be the best weapons to weild.  The multiplayer maps are pretty good.  I lost alot of stats due to the host quiting.Like any other COD, people hack it like crazy.  The bulk of my knowledge about Blk Ops concerns zombies; it's addictive, fun,frustrating, non-sensical, brutal, time-consuming and repetetive.  The waves of zombies get larger and tougher, unlessyou know a couple secrets about MOON.  You have guns available for purchase, can gamble on the ? box, and can buy perks to aidyour efforts.  The perks include speed reloading, extra health, stamina, explosive immunity, increased fire rate,quick reviving, carry extra weapon, and narrow cross hair/auto aim for heads.  You get points for every time you hit a zombie,and a whopping 130 for a stab kill.  Learning how to play zombies is like learning what not to do in order to stay alive.The game can get pretty nuts while playing online with three others.  When people run all over the place, or mess with yourstuff, it's maddening.  There's alot of etiquite involved while playing zombies.  You should give other players room,because every player needs space to work with.  After learning how the zombies chase after you, they can be predictable,and you can use it to your advantage.  Sometimes, you just have to run around, leading the zombies after you, so youcan do a 180 and polish them off.  Bullets pass through them, and rack up points.  This is important for conserving ammoin later rounds.  Playing zombies makes you paranoid, because you never know when more are going to pop out.  Alwayswatch your back.  Players without spines get in glitches, immune to attack.  People don't hack the game, though.If the host quits, the game's over.  If people quit, the connection usually gets worse.  You can press select to see receptionbars.  Sub-machine guns have a good fire rate and make you quick, but have low ammo.  Light machine guns have more ammo,but slow you down.  Don't bother with shotguns and sniper rifles in zombies.  The ray gun's powerful, but is bad for points,and can hurt you with blowback.  The reason Blk Ops is still popular is zombies.  The multiplayer community was strong untilMW3 came out.  The campaign is worth playing, but not the main ticket.

I have not come across a lot of the problems that people claim to have encountered. Some are really absurd such as claiming that the game stops working after such and such time.

I am a gamer who enjoy great video games. I have COD, Battlefield and Meddle of Honor and a whole host of military type games. But I always have gone back to COD because they have great multiplayer. No, they are not realistic. Those who think that shooting a gun in COD amounts to shooting a real gun has to have his head checked. Even a ten year old can shoot a bazooka in COD. And being able to play COD does not, I repeat, does not make you a soldier. Playing a video game is one thing. Shooting a real rifle is another. What is so laughable is the comments I hear over and over in multiplayer where players call others the put-down, \"camper\". I've got news for them. Real soldiers camp. It is part of military strategy. Despite the idiots who \"rage\" during the game, it is a fun game. The only knock I have for Black Ops is that the graphics for the multiplayer does not stand up to Modern Warfare 3's. Yes, it is an older game but one map in particular looks cartoonish. Some may like the fact that it is small which renders it a run-and-gun map but it could have used more work. If you are sitting on the fence, you should get the game. It is a whole lot of fun.

So, like others, I have reverted back to playing Black Ops.  I have to say that I complained about this game when it was first released, but after dealing with the latest abortion Infinity Ward released I have a little more appreciation for this game.  Sure, it has some issues.  For starters, in multiplayer mode the spawn system is probably the worst of any CoD game I have ever played (which is all of them).  People have been spawned behind me while I was camping in a corner and vice versa (so close that I am literally sitting in their lap.) There is also a lag at times, but it is nothing compared to both Modern Warfare 2 and 3.  Because I have maxed out my prestige in multiplayer, I mostly play zombies now.  Zombies is fun and addictive, but it can be a cheap pos at times.  The mystery box will either give you good weapons throughout the game, or it will give you nothing at all.  For me, the latter is what usually happens.  I am good with using the weapons on the wall (because the mystery box usually sucks), but they are not much help in the later rounds.  There are some other problems, but not enough to call this game bad.  If you are new to Call of Duty, I would recommend Black Ops over any other game in the series (especially MW2 or 3).  I give Black Ops 3 1/2 stars because of the added zombie mode and because the multiplayer is superior as a whole compared the rest of the CoD series.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Better than MW3....but that isn't saying much", "unixReviewTime": 1345507200, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2012"}

Look i enjoyed MW2 just as much as the next person. It is time someone said it. CoD games have been CLONES ever since MW dropped. New features(border-line gimmicks) from title to title don't negate the fact that the core game-play has remained virtually unchanged since 2007.  Let's cut to the chase;Zombies...My friends and I have spent countless hours on zombie mode in WaW (still did right up until black ops' release)and I could not be more thrilled with the new Zombie mode in Black ops. New maps, *the classic maps return with black ops weapons, The zombies are faster and stronger, new enemies make their debut, Pack-a-Punch and Perka-Colas Return! + new features have also been added to boost your odds of survival(especially when playing Solo!)...OH! and the guns are Awesome! If you are like me (NEVER finished Special Ops in MW2 only to return to the walking dead of WaW) get Black Ops. You will not be disappointedSingle Player Campaign:One of the most intriguing stories in a CoD Campaign to date. The twist was a little predictable but it's a game not a full-length Block-buster movie. Graphics are sharp and the Action is non-stop. My friends and I finished in about 5-6 Hrs. I had a blast with it.Multi-player:Multi-player is not really my bag but like i said a CoD Game is just exactly  that... and you should know by now exactly how those play; unless you've been living under a rock for the last 3 years and somehow missed out on the juggernaut that is CoD. The new option to get two players online split-screen with one console(also in zombies) is a great idea/improvement. I am playing on a low resolution HD TV(720p) and can't distinguish much of a difference between graphics quality or frame-rate of this title and that of the last.Black Ops' Multi-Player feels a little more balanced in terms of the kill-streaks, perks and weapons available to players.The fast paced Tactical-FPS action we all know and love is still alive and well with Black ops.

Thankfully, Treyarch have been consistently releasing bug fixing and balancing patches. So the game has progressively improved for the most part.I have 2 main computers that I have tried running Black Ops on:1) My desktop, only a few months old and very powerful.2) My HP Laptop which is about 2.5 years old, but is pretty powerful for a laptop (I can run most new games, albeit at lower graphics)Both are ATI/Intel combinations.On PC #1: The game runs like a charm, very few issues after the patches which fixed some crashing/freezing issues (unacceptable to have this in a released game).On PC #2: Game is actually somewhat choppy, and this is a laptop that has run every single previous version of COD very smoothly including most recently Modern Warfare 2. This is basically the same unreal engine yet it has performance issues on my laptop, I have like a weird delay when playing sometimes. It's playable, but it's not comparable to the game on my Desktop, it's like two different games.PROS:- Very few games come close to how good the CoD multiplayer experience is.- Treyarch opted for dedicated servers, after the disaster hacker infested garbage IWnet of MW2 crashed and burned miserably. This means admins and kick/ban powers, a lot less cheaters on good servers.- Game has everything you'd expect from a COD game, but the maps are a bit smaller than MW2.- Single player is better than Modern Warfare 2, and the storyline makes a lot more sense and is a lot less like a horrible Michael Bay summer blockbuster.CONS:- Optimization sucks on certain PC specs, can ruin your gameplay experience and frustrate you to no end depending how bad it is.- It's more of the same, this is Modern Warfare based in the Cold War era. Same engine, killstreak mechanics, and fast paced shoot first or die.- If you are one of the no skill idiots who aimbots/wallhacks in MW2 because there are no admins, then you should stay away from this. First of all because you're a loser and you suck, second of all you'll be banned from all the good servers.CONCLUSION: Look, if you love COD/FPS multiplayer games chances are you will love this as well. And if you hated the previous CODs, same logic you probably won't like this.The LOW RATINGS you find here are a bit unfair, in the sense that the game is a LOT of fun if your computer can run it well.My advice? If you have a friend who has the game, borrow his/her steam account and try out the game on your rig. If you go through all that trouble and it works well, what are you waiting for?

The SP campaign is boring and cliched, as well as very short (by some accounts even shorter than MW2's SP campaign.)  CoD 1, 2, & 4 made good use of scripted action sequences without actually overusing them.  Not the case in BO however.  It seems video games are going the way of Hollywood movies, where everything must be AAA over the top special effects without a care for the story.Some people may also take issue with being forced to use Steam as this is a Steamworks game.  However, I'm pro-Steam myself and have almost 100 games I've purchased on there, but thought I would still point this fact out because it can definitely be a deal-breaker for some.I was one of the (few, perhaps) people who boycotted MW2 PC and actually stuck to my guns.  You look on most of the 'boycot MW2' Steam community groups for instance, and most of their members are now listed as owning MW2 on Steam.  Way to make a point, idiots.  I guess Kotick figures he can just take a dump in a box that his Activision goons are holding and they'll just mark it CoD 2k11, 2k12, etc. and enough stupid people will buy it.  Maybe they'll take the EA approach and come out with yearly editions which don't improve on graphics and merely are roster updates.

Aiming down the sight is slow and isn't practical. Lag makes the knife a less viable weapon because your opponent almost always sees you coming. You learn to cope with the lag but in MW2 there was no perpetual state of having lag and when there was lag it wasn't this bad.I prefer the way human faces and objects like cars are rendered in MW2 than in BO. Human faces in BO look less detailed and seem \"cartoony\". I was disappointed with the way the game rendered JFK's face. The faces of the North Korean enemy NPCs weren't drawn well and their voices didn't seem real enough unlike the Russian NPCs voices which were good.In BO the player's view of the environment is wider and it feels almost like a third person view with the gun sight placed in the center. I prefer the narrower field of view in MW2. Most metallic objects like guns look too shiny and end up looking like plastic rather than metal.Here are some positive aspects of BO:1. The \"Jungle\" multiplayer map is impressive. The outdoor environment has dense vegetation, a rope bridge and elevated huts. It's the best jungle environment I've seen in FPS games so far.2. The in-game UI is polished and more intuitive than in MW2.3. You can buy gun camo to \"pimp your gun\". XP grinding isn't needed to buy guns, perks and attachments.

I have a 3 year old CPU (Intel QX6700), a 2 year old motherboard (XFX 790i), a single GTX 470 and 6GB of RAM running on Windows 7 64-bit.  I installed this game over the weekend and been playing since with max setting and no problems whatsoever.  I guess I'm lucky compared to the droves of people that are having issues.  There are a lot of negative reviews - I would be angry too if it weren't working correctly on my system and I too would give a one-star, but it's working fine and I enjoy it, therefore the positive review (I'm certain my positive review will generate a \"no\" for being helpful but I can't rightfully ding it if it is working for me as advertised).Onto the game, I am thoroughly enjoying myself with this game.  The single player is ok and entertaining but I'm much more into the multiplayer.  It is definitely fun for me, fast paced and a welcome follow-on to modern warfare 2.  I like the fact that you can buy the perks you want, rather than waiting for each one to unlock as was the case in MW2.  Same thing with attachments.  There seems to be a balance of what you can buy and what you can unlock to keep it interesting and not overwhelming playing against players who are already leveled up significantly.  Another plus is the premade classes that you can use - as a newbie like me, that's great because I got to try out some of the perks without having to buy them and quite enjoyed the \"assault\" class - got a lot of kills using that Last Stand.A couple of negatives that I think they should fix - first of all, having the option to join a dedicated server or just be auto-assigned to a ranked server is nice but it needs to be fixed.  It's frustrating to be auto-assigned to a ranked server only to wait for it to load and be told \"server is full\".  Really???  How silly is that, then don't auto-assign me there!  MW2 didn't have that problem...why not use the same auto-assigning engine???  Just strange to me.  Also, when I join up on my friend who is in game, I wish that it would always put us on the same team, or at least give us an option.  When we are playing together, sometimes we are randomly on the same team and sometimes we are not.  Also, why can't I join up on my friend from the Steam interface like other games allow?  In multiplayer, I think the helicopter gunships are way over-powered.  At first people thought that they were hacks when the guy with gunships are getting like 50 kills and dying only a couple of times - that goes to show how dominant that helo is.  Also, when you shoot someone, sometimes you don't even know you killed them.  In MW2, there was no question when you kill someone, here, maybe its the sound effects or whatever but many times I'll waste ammo shooting at a guy to ensure I killed him.  Not sure what it is but it just doesn't feel quite right.  Minor gripes - but overall, like any newly released game, I'm sure the bugs will be ironed out - minus one star for that.Unlike other people, I'm glad that this game is on Steam.  I am on the the Steam bandwagon (at least until I see signs of it sinking) I have a portable eSata hard drive where my steam folder is on and all my Steam games and I'm able plug it into my second PC when the other is being used and visa-versa, plus I never have to worry about patching my games, disc in drive and so on - it's super convenient for me.Anyhow, the reviews on this game are mixed...mostly negative, but with high profile games such as the Call of Duty Franchise, expectations will be high.  It met my expecatations mostly, which is why I'm giving it 4-stars.

Then to MW1. Now to black ops.Black Ops is developed by a different developer than the modern warfare series. I'm not really aware of any other major game franchise that pulls off something like this, having two different devs working on the same IP. The differences are subtle. Infinity Ward is more serious and somber while this game is laugh-out-loud funny. IW tends to have lousy briefings but really impressive in-game moments. Treyarch (the devs of this game) seems to place more emphasis on the writing and characters than IW. The level design isn't quite as inventive and the scripted moments are not as awe-inspiring.So, in Black Ops I found myself caring more about the plot and story compared to MW, while I was less impressed with the events that happened in the missions. When you die in MW, you get treated to a quote from a serious world leader or intellectual. In Black Ops, the missions start with this comical blacking out of information, making it literally a \"black op.\"I tend to play games like these as RPG's, in that I pretend that I'm actually in the setting. So it's an interesting tradeoff. I would recommend going in the order I played, since what gets you at first in gaming are the in-game moments. Later on as the game formula becomes apparent, having good characters starts to matter more.This is one of the best story-driven game narratives I've ever played. I'd rank this as better than any Bioware game, even. There's a really cool Forrest Gump feeling you get playing the game, due to the retro setting. The characters are amazingly charismatic. To convince, just let me mention that one of the voice actors is none other than Gary Oldman.Another nice thing about COD games is that you never feel alone while playing the game. You always have an AI friend guiding you through the mission and yelling encouragement.I believe that this game has enough serious literary merit that it will be revisited in years to come like a classic novel.So yes, the SP is pretty incredible. That alone is worth the purchase.Now, as for the sequel, well, skip it.

The graphics in single player seem much different from those in multiplayer however - those in multiplayer seem lifeless, washed out, and reminiscent of older games.Multiplayer has game killer flaws - everyone is lagging currently.

Crecca \"Psychonewb\"", "helpful": [1, 6], "reviewText": "I am going to start off this review saying that I have played every CoD game since the original Call of Duty.  I will say that Treyarch did an amazing job trying to catch up, or even surpass the juggernaut MW and MW2.  However this game does come with some of its own problems.  Like many people have said, this game is built for consoles with PC gamers second in mind.  Personally this ticks me off considering that CoD started as a PC franchise and was ported to consoles.  Now it seems like it is a console franchise with a port to PC.  This is totally unacceptable for any studio considering that PC gaming has been around a lot longer than console gaming and in my personal opinion will be the console king for the FPS genre.  Where would the FPS genre be without one of the best original PC FPS games... Doom?With all of that said, this does not mean the game is not fun in any way.  My biggest complaint is that the controls are not as tight as they were in MW and MW2.  It will take a little bit of getting use to but not too long.  I have used a Logitech G9x for MW,MW2, and now Black Ops and I noticed a significant difference in look movement.  The multiplayer is extremely addicted as you would expect from any CoD multiplayer and Wager matches are just too much fun to pass by.  I personally like the system of CoD points as opposed to ranking up for new guns/attachments/perks/killstreaks ect.  All the maps seem to be pretty balanced with 1 or 2 exceptions.If you are a serious FPS comptetive player like myself, you should not hesitate to pick this up IF and ONLY IF you have somewhat of a beefy computer.  I have an i7 960, 12gb RAM, and 2 nVidia GTX 480s in SLI and it runs perfectly.  I know some people have complained that it requires too much in order to play but unfortunately thats the price you pay for wanting a PC game.  New games like this will continue to require bigger and better components to be able to run them. This goes back tot he reason why this is now a PC port.

However, the solo campaign in COD BO is so bug-riddled, I'm just about ready to throw in the towel on completing it.  I've had the game freeze numerous times after I'd passed several checkpoints and nearly completed levels.  It wouldn't be so bad if I could resume at a checkpoint but if the game has to be forcefully ended via task manager (as is the case for just about every freeze), you start over at the beginning of the level (or wherever you left off when you last exited the game properly)!  An \"easy\" work around is to frequently quit the game manually and restart again after the last checkpoint, but seriously, who wants to exit the game after every stinking checkpoint???  I bought the game eight months after release and this is the nonsense I'm dealing with???  And before anyone starts chirping \"Well, you shouldn't play the game on a lousy system\", not only is the system way more than sufficient to run the game, I've played through several solo campaigns of Crysis 2 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 without one single crash, ever.  And that's with all the visuals maxed out on both.  If Black Ops works flawlessly for some, I'm glad for them.  Maybe certain drivers or software elements of certain systems get along better with the game, resulting in no crashes, but there is no way I'm buying that this game isn't flawed after playing countless other games that are just as demanding or even more demanding on my system.Now the multiplayer is actually pretty fun.  Not only can you play against human opponents, it also has a training mode that lets you play \"multiplayer\" against CPU opponents. Granted, as you jack up the difficulty, your team members get dumber while the enemy  gets much smarter.  On the highest levels, the CPU opponents get laughably cheap, camping nonstop (yet if you try it, an enemy will quickly sneak up on you or fire a random sniper shot from some impossible far away angle and pick you off), enemies spawn at your must vulnerable spots, enemies walk right through grenade blasts and dozens of bullets while you fall from a single shot, and while the enemy spends time flanking you constantly and working as a team, your computer teammates run around aimlessly like F-Troop. After a while, you'll start thinking the human cheaters aren't so bad.

No doubt, the incumbent has big shoes to fill after Activision's wildly successfulModern Warfare 2. Lets start with the good: dedicated servers are back! No more mid game host migration and peer-hosted 350ms+ ping games. This in an of itself should be enough to win over PC gamers.  Other pluses include a wide range of new weapons and equipment such as ballistic knifes, crossbows, attack dogs, NAPALM strikes, etc... which add some interesting new variety to game play. The multi-player maps are also very fun, my favorite being the firing range.Now for the bad: there are some huge problems with performance and general game play for PC gamers.  First of all, this game is a console game and feels like a console game. The PC port feels forced and, at times, utterly claustrophobic.  The menus don't make much sense and lag terribly. (You have to completely leave the server and the game to modify your custom classes.) The maps, which are deceivingly large, will feel smaller than a cardboard box when you spawn directly on top of the enemy team time and time again. Finally, some performance issues (namely frame rate and stuttering) are practically impossible to eliminate.I feel the graphics in Black Ops are an acquired taste. After playing Modern Warfare 2 for several months, I was immediately disappointed in the \"flat\" look of the textures. The environment doesn't allow half as much interaction as one would expect and the maps are often closed off and very linear. For example: in headquarters mode, there are sometimes only one or two paths to approach a given objective. Many times, you'll have to run through the streets since most of the buildings lack doorways and are not navigable.All-in-all, despite some of the big game play issues, Black Ops is a fun game which may bring back some of the old LAN party nostalgia. I hope Treyarc continues to release updates and patches which address server stability and performance issues.

MacMahon", "helpful": [4, 7], "reviewText": "When people talk about Call of Duty, at least the last few installments, they often focus almost solely on the multiplayer.  As a long-time singleplayer FPS gamer on the PC however I still enjoy Call of Duty for its singleplayer content.  The original game was one of the greatest FPS games of all time if you ask me and the original Modern Warfare was another spectacular singleplayer experience.  How does Black Ops measure up based solely on singleplayer?  Poorly.First off Black Ops continues the trend of shorter and shorter singleplayer campaigns.  I would put it at about 5 hours on the harder difficulty, probably 4 or less if you play it on an easier setting.  Some people may take longer if they spend a lot of time looking around or replaying segments but overall it's not a long game.  Worse than this though is the simple fact that you have played this game before, many times, and it's starting to get a little tired.  When Modern Warfare 2 came out I felt a little creak as I started playing; it was already what I would consider an old formula and it was already time for a change.  Black Ops is not that change, Black Ops is exactly the same game with slightly different visuals.  At least World At War was a different looking time period and location with Japan in WW2, but Black Ops, despite being set in the 1960's, looks and plays exactly like Modern Warfare.  It is in essence the third Modern Warfare game in 3 years and that makes you feel every rotting piece of old gameplay with brute force.The graphics are alright, nothing amazing but pretty good on high settings.  It comes on one DVD compared to 2 DVDs for the last game but I didn't notice any drop in texture quality as a result.  Sound is pretty standard, you know what you're getting... the music used in the Vietnam sections is as cliche as possible and comes off kind of silly rather than emotional.  To be honest there isn't really much point in going over anything here because it's all the same... it's Modern Warfare, a third time, with maybe slightly less polish.  Sometimes you will get stuck on things and often times the scripting, like the AI waiting for you to reach a spot before doing something, is much more obvious.  Modern Warfare 1 and 2 hid the game's basic mechanics better is what I guess I am trying to say.  All in all though it's the same exact game, and the cobwebs are showing.PC port is decent.  All the usual control options are there and lean is back, which is nice, though honestly I am so used to \"E\" being my activate button now I just ignored lean and mapped it that way anyway.  Unlike the last few CoD games Anisotropic Filtering didn't seem to be on by default so I forced it on through my GPU's control panel, which worked fine.  Performance was a little worse than the last few CoD games due mostly to more being put on the CPU, a sign of poor optimization from the console versions.  Patches have supposedly fixed this but I haven't noticed much difference.  The DRM is Steamworks, which requires a one-time online activation at install and ties the game to an account to prohibit lending or selling.  It's lame and pointless on an open platform as the game will be pirated anyway, but what else is new from these clueless publishers.All in all this review is kind of superfluous.  Did you like Modern Warfare 2?  Do you want another game EXACTLY like that, only a bit rougher around the edges?  Then get this game when it hits the dollar amount you think 5 hours of that is worth.

Ive never done a review like this before but Callof duty:MW2 really stung me back in 2009 and I swore I wouldnt make the same mistake twice (remember no servers issue).I have waited for the general response first... and to me it sounds very bad for the following reasons.To truly understand my plight, you'd have to really understand the history of Call of Duty for the PC.Call Of Duty gained its reputation among hardcore FPS players for its playability and attention to detail. Along the way Call of duty has had its bumps and falls but the core mechanics of the game were still in the hands of people who understood the game.The real success of Call of Duty has come in the way of tight programming. Its accessibility (much like Counter-strike) was its tight coding and strong performance. As long as you had a decent hardware you could count on Call of Duty running very smoothly. Last years computer could still play it comfortably. This made it a multiplayer success because players could concentrate on the technical challenge of fragging each other down. When you're dealing with a mexican stand-off, the last thing you need is a stutter.Power hungry. poorly coded games dont have a long multiplayer life. They always sink.The longest standing FPS multiplayer domains have always existed around games that have been tightly coded. Counter Strike, Unreal, quake etc. These games were smooth and fluid by nature. They were born smooth.. not because it took three kids to run the system (one to spray the graphics card with Nitrous, another to wee on the fans and the third to play it with his toes while he blew ferociously at the CPU)This years Call of duty is a power hungry game which has been poorly programmed. It is simply wasteful. The software is so poorly derived and raw that your hardware needs to work twice as hard to get the same output. Now some kids will cry bloody murder! Insist that it is my responsibility to buy better hardware, but these kids are completely oblivious to the real truth.There is nothing specailly new about Call of Duty: Black Ops. Why should I pay more money for an upgrade because the prgrammers did a lazy inefficent job of mapping out the coding.Which brings me to my second point. Why should I go out and purchase a new $2000 setup for CAll of Duty: Black ops when it wasnt designed for the PC. Originally a game that was made for the PC is now a last minute port conversion. This game wasnt for us.Yes, I realize i have never played the game. I dont know if it is really fun. But at some point you have to make a stand.

This was my first first person shooter I have played, so I have never had anything to compare it to. I played it to pass the time in Afghanistan. My first impressions was that there were way too many, and far too lengthy, cut scenes. They made for a decent story, although I didn't much care for having the majority of combat taking place as flashbacks. One chapter even took place as a flashback within a flashback. And I didn't like that I would switch between characters. This was also the first time I have had to reduce graphics for performance. My computer can run almost any new game on full graphics, no problem, but for whatever reason, Black Ops was a bit laggy.All negativity aside, I did enjoy it very much. The graphics, even turned down, are great, I don't know what so many people are complaining about. The voice acting was very realistic, and I instantly recognized Ed Harris. I would say cut back on the swearing, as it is unnecessary, but it actually adds to the realism, since that kind of language exists in the service. What I liked most was the variety. In one mission, you are running down the streets of Cuba, fighting off dozens of soldiers, in another, you are sneaking around in stealth, slicing throats and planting explosives. There is zip lining, skydiving, and sniping, which I loved. And there is no shortages of vehicles to operate: Cars, boats, helicopters, even the radar in the SR-71.Overall, I would recommend the game. I would say it's worth $30. I don't do multiplayer, so that doesn't factor in. Since I bought this, I have played Half Life 2 and its expansions. Despite being 8 years old, it's a much better game, but very different. I also played Sniper: Ghost Warrior, which is decent, but not enough to play again. I have played Black Ops 3 times, and I liked it each time. But it's not great. I might try another Call Of Duty sometime.-UPDATE-After upgrading from 4GB Ram to 8GB, this can run on maximum graphics very smoothly.

The cut scenes are decent and the story is very detailed. After you beat the game it puts you into a zombie mode that you play as JFK. Some of the levels have great graphics. There is a level in Vietnam that is just incredible. It reminded me so much of Crysis.Cons: Some levels look like they were made five years ago and I have a top of the line gaming machine. I don't understand how one map can look great and the next mission looks like something from 2005. The AI is not very difficult to play against even at the hardest difficulty. The gun selection is terrible but I guess that is what they used in the 1960's. I was just hoping for a lot more when it came to the weapons. In every mission I was having to decide between an AK47 with a scope and an AK47 with an extended clip. The biggest down side to the single player campaign is the cut scenes I enjoyed the first play through. You are forced to watch so many useless cut scenes without the ability to skip a lot of them. It really hurts the replayability of this game because there are so many cut scenes in each mission.Multiplayer - This is why I bought the gamePros - No hackers, lots of servers, ping of less than 20, and several game types to chose from. Also the guns, and kill streaks are much better once you get into multiplayer. One of my favorite things is the ability to customize your character. You get to choose the paint on your gun, paint on your face, different emblems and the list goes on. It's really cool to have a blue camo gun and blue war paint on your face as you run around. There are several dozen options of face paint and gun color. You also get to customize your emblem. The graphics are really good in multiplayer. I would rate the graphics up there with MW2 and other FPS's like Medal of Honor.Cons - servers are 18 on 18. I would have preferred the option to have bigger servers. A lot of the maps are small so I understand the 18 person limit but some bigger maps would have been nice.Some people had bug issues but apparently all those have been resolved. I never had an issue with the game in single player or multiplayer. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a good first person shooter and doesn't mind throwing down the $60 to get it.Also, there are 14 prestige's available.

The single player campaign is identical to the 360 version and is much better than the MW2 campaign (imo, of course). Also, playing with dedicated servers removes any host advantage like on the 360's multiplayer component.  The PC version, for me, is just as fun as the 360 version but even with the dedicated servers (which is a huge plus in my book), there are still some issues that really bug me.The method of finding servers (via server browser) feels really basic and antiquated. Of course  you can filter by map types, game types, empty servers, and full servers. However, there's no ability to filter by ping or region. I can overlook those issues, but what really annoys me is when I load COD: BO and click server browser (or even ranked match), COD: BO will have about a 75% chance of freezing and the only way I know how close the game when this happens is to terminate the process using task manager (ctl+alt+del).Still, once the game is loaded and I'm happily fragging away the game will occasionally freeze momentarily (about 1-2 sec) then resume. It's like I suddenly lost connection, but this feels a little different. For you programmer types, it's like the whole client decided to pause and do garbage collection. This usually results in a death unless I'm lucky enough for it to happen when no enemies are around. This freeze sucks and a fix for this should be a top priority for Treyarch, but I will tolerate it unlike the server browser freezing the game.Not to wish that this game was any more of a console port, but there are some things that are in the 360 that I wish were in the PC version:1. being able to update/create a class loadout between matches. Currently, I have to leave the server to update my classes.2. multiplayer lobbies. I'm not saying peer to peer networking like MW2, but it would be nice to have a lobby (imo) between maps. I know it's doable because valve was able to implement both lobbies and dedicated servers with the l4d series.Currently, between maps there's only a 10 second break before the next match starts. It would be nice if there was a 20 second break between maps, while in a lobby, displaying which map is next in the rotation. Additionally, the players could vote to skip the next map if the majority voted for it. Of course, this should be an option that could be set by the admin.Overall, I really enjoy the game, but there's less polish in this PC version over the 360 version. Unfortunately, while I'm sure the developers at Treyarch are a bunch of swell guys, I doubt they will fix the issues or add any features that I described above.When the game works, the multiplayer action is 10x faster and more frantic than the 360 version. It's been stated that the multiplayer population has declined since its release, but there's about 10,000-20,000 on most evenings when I'm playing. That's probably less than a quarter than the amount that's on XBOX LIVE, but it's more than enough to find a match anytime of the day at a location of your choice (provided the server browser doesn't freeze the game). At the very least, there's always Combat Training to simulate the the multiplayer experience via bots.For me, the game play is fun 5/5, but the game itself is only 2/5 due to the lack of polish and missing features that are present in the 360. If the freezing issues were fixed, then this is definitely a 4 star game in my book.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fun gameplay, subpar execution", "unixReviewTime": 1297728000, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2011"}

Sme\"", "helpful": [37, 46], "reviewText": "I was a little surprised at how low the ratings are for Black Ops, I've actually liked it better that Modern Warfare 2, and wonder where the venom is coming from.  Last time time it was the multiplayer, this time it seems to be something else.Yes, the game is geared more towards console players, that's the way things are today, but it's still enjoyable on the PC. The single player was much better, while the graphics are still notching up rather than making revolutionary changes.  The story is more like COD4; longer with a convoluted plot but now with a 60's Cold War setting.  As with World at War there's a couple of vehicle levels that are in some way unique from what you've done before, and as with Modern Warfare 2 lots of cool weapons to play with.  In what may be a unique twist for the series two of the characters from World at War appear; one is a major player, the other is in a bit part.  Overall the single player was killer.The Zombies mode is.....different.  If you've ever wondered what it would be like to play JFK in an abandoned Pentagon fighting off hordes of Zombies, this is your chance.And now the multiplayer...Modern Warfare 2 selected the servers for you, and the wailing and gnashing was heard round the world.  How could people form clans? How could they gather together on their favorite servers and cheat, er, play competitively?  How could people make arbitrary nonsense rules about not using rockets or using only sniper rifles?  How can admins who never say they're an admin just decide this round is a knife fight only and the next will just be pistols, and wield the almighty ban stick for logging in and not knowing what's going on?  Or just ban anyone who plays better than them or they decide they don't like?  Well, all that's back.  I actually liked the Modern Warfare 2 system better, just log in and play, only a problem if you cheat; but this is more popular for obvious reasons.While Modern Warfare 2 felt and looked a little cartoon like, Black Ops is pretty much an amped up COD4.  The maps in general have more corridors and alleys, so you have to keep your head on a swivel and watch out for enemies.  There's more variety in weapons (someday they'll run out of cool guns), and the upgrade system to me is more fun.  You still rise through levels too fast, but you earn money to buy upgrades, and there are plenty.  Some perks you gain more skill as you use them, and now you can at last (With the Warlord perk) use two attachments on the same gun.  I really don't understand the hatred about the multiplayer, but have noted most of the negative reviews were from when the game was first released and *duh* lots of people were signing up at once. I haven't had any problems with lag or slow response.My only complaints about the multiplayer is the same I've had on any COD multiplayer: the made up server rules and cheating.  I'll admit I'm just an average player; but when you play enough you know what works, that enemies normally drop with 2-3 hits from an assault rifle.  When someone comes along who is almost untouchable; they always run and never seem to slow down, knife everyone all over the map, get you at ease with endless head shots, and the only way you can drop them is several point blank hits with a light machine gun, something's up.  Heaven forbid you ever try to call one of them on their unlikely prowess, you'll never hear the end of it....It's also one thing to cheat, but if you don't like something the game allows why be so difficult about it?  I've argued for a long time they ought to allow the multiplayer server features to be customized.  You log into a server then whatever they don't like is disabled and no more headaches about so-n-so doesn't want you using Last Stand so you have to create a class without it just to please them.  Really, I play for fun, not to deal with someone's control freak obsession.  The latest thing going around is servers trying to ban people from running.  Yes running.  People are shooting at you and it's supposed to just be a fun action game but don't dare run because then the 25 year old admin living in his mother's basement will ban you for life.  Actually I ask them to do that so I won't have to worry about logging into their server again; at least there's plenty of good servers still out there.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Are we playing the same game?", "unixReviewTime": 1291766400, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2010"}

If anything, my original review of (4 stars) was inflated a bit to counter act the countless 1 star reviews saying \"my game does not work.\" However, after all this time, I still think the game deserves 2/5 for single player and 5/5 for multiplayer, which gives us and average score of 3.5/5. There has been many improvements through patches, so if you can get game for a decent price (on one of steam's Christmas sales), I would say go for it.Original Review:First of all let me say that this game requires a really good computer. I've been playing this game on a AMD Phenom II X4 955, a 1GB GeForce GTS 250, and 4GB of DDR3 ram. On my system the game runs super smooth from release day, that includes both the multiplayer and single-player. Surprisingly if you have a system that runs this game, this game is actually enjoyable. Please read on to see my thoughts.--Single Player---This game does not reflect the tried and true CoD story format as seen in many of the other games. Unlike CoD 2, CoD4, or MW2, this game pretty much follows the story of one soldier Alex Mason. What makes this unique is that the story in Black Ops, when compared to other CoD games, is actually intriguing. In other CoD games, the story only existed for the gameplay, and you never became attached to the characters your were playing (hell I can't even remember their names). However, in Black Ops you actually care about Alex Mason as you go on this roller coaster ride of his past.The story is great, interesting, and will actually last you about 6-8 hours, when compared to MW2's 3-4 hour campaign. However, the gameplay has taken a step back from MW2. The levels are predictable with the same bad guys in the same place, and your team mates AI still have issues jumping in front of your gun fire. Luckily, your team mates have better AI than the bad guys, because the bad guys are seriously pretty stupid. I cannot tell you how many times one of the bad guys came rushing in lone wolf style into the crossfire of me and my two AI team mates.I'm not saying the gameplay is bad, I'm just saying its a step back from MW2. Now your team mates feel like the ones in CoD4 and the bad guys feel like the bad guys from CoD:WaW (just with updated weapons). Also there are too many points in the game where enemies are infinitely spawning, which can make levels a tedious chore based on luck. I'm sad that Treyarch did not take a page from Infinity Ward when it comes to single player campaigns.Overall, the story is interesting and makes you feel like your inside a movie. So i give the Single Player a 2/5---Multiplayer---Luckily, Treyarch did not take a page from Infinity Ward on how to make a multiplayer game. The multiplayer is vastly improved over MW2. First of all we have semi-dedicated servers (semi because you must use a specific 3rd party to run your server), which is great because now admins have complete control over who and who is not on there server. Therefore, VAC + admin control = less hackers, which is what plagued MW2 to an early grave.Less hackers means fair and competitive gameplay, but Treyarch did not stop there. They also did there best to balance out the super overly unbalanced MW2 multiplayer. While MW2 has some really cool perks, a few of them were so overpowered, especially when used in specific combos. Not to say Black Ops is perfectly balance, because its not, but its good enough to make the game enjoyable.There is also some new features and game play modes. The coolest is that unlike in MW2, you earn money called COD points while you level up. These points can be used to purchased weapons, add-ons, perks, upgrades and aesthetic things such as warpaint. COD points allow the leveling system to be less linear as it was in MW2. Now you can decide what you want to purchase or upgrade, while deciding what things you want to skip.Even with all these features, its still a shoot and not get shot at game. So I give the Multiplayer a 5/5---Overall---This game is pretty good, but i warn you, this game probably wont run on last gen computers. If you have a duo-core, I would probably stay away from this game. Likewise quad-core's and tri-cores do not necessarily guarantee success, especially if your using a quad-core in a crappy mobo (one made for an older cpu). Because of the hardware requirements, this game has gotten crappy reviews, but trust me in saying this game is way better than 1 or 2 stars.If you can play GTA IV on high with a decent FPS, then this game is guaranteed to run on your system.My system:AMD Phenom II X4 9551GB GeForce GTS 2502x2GB DDR3 ramMSI 870A-G54 AM3 MoboNote: I know the game requirements are less than what I say you need, but trust me you'll want a good machine to run this.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "This game isn't as bad as the reviews say", "unixReviewTime": 1290384000, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2010"}

Steam recently offered a free weekend of play with Black Ops, and I checked it out. The free trial was multi player only, no single player.I had no issues connecting and finding games, and experienced very little lag except when the round would first start. Fortunately, enemies are usually far enough away at the start, so it doesn't hurt you that much. I didn't like the short time between rounds. I could barely read the scoreboard before it would disappear and the next map would be loading.Graphics were not good.  Player animations looked old (as in graphics I saw in games 6 years ago) and clunky. When you see players \"sprint\", they seem to float and move unrealistically fast. A couple of the maps looked decent, but overall I thought they were lacking detail and you could not interact with the environment much at all.Based on what I was able to \"unlock\" during the free weekend, the weapons seemed pretty cool, and I liked all the customization options.But here is where the game completely frustrated me. You cannot run and gun. When you are sprinting with a shotgun for example, and come around the corner and see an enemy, and you press the fire button...guess what...your shotgun doesn't fire. Instead your player will stop running and raise his weapon. At that point you can then press fire again and shoot. But you are usually dead by then.  Essentially then game will not allow you to run and shoot at the same time. Beyond that, running in the game is messed up even when you don't want to shoot. You hold the shift key to start running, and you should stop running when you release the key. But nooooo...you have to press some other key or click your mouse to stop running....and then you are dead.

Firstly, the general movements of the characters are choppy and sluggish, rather than organic and smooth - character's physical reactions to things such as slippey wurfaces, or bullet hits are repetitive and mechanical. The absence of \"the little details,\" as well as repetitive use of models in level environments make for a bland and unrealistic experience. The audio is atrocious; the sounds of gunfire , explosions, etc. are pathetically weak.

Instead, it seems to have regressed to an storyline experience on par with the earliest series' in the franchise.Like them or not, Infinity Ward was innovative - Treyarch simply lifted and copied bits and pieces of what Infinity Ward mastered.Nevertheless, dedicated fans of the franchise will still find the game to be generally enjoyable", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A disappointment", "unixReviewTime": 1289347200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2010"}

I have a really nice gaming rig with a Intel Core 2 Quad(2.67ghz), 8 gigs of DDR3 RAM, 750gbHD, with an additional 1TB HD. Also i've had an ATI 4850 1gigDDR3 card for about a year and there isn't anything i can't run at full 1080p, other than Crysis, which i don't play anyways. So i'm not sure if everyone playing this on PC is using Nvidia Cards, they installed it and play using a disc or what, but all these 1 star reviews make no sense to me.I have not had one bit of lag, even with everything going on, explosions everywhere, planes flying, grenades, debri, whatever, has not slowed down the game or been hard on my PC at all. I think people may be irritated because Activision(Infinity Ward) didn't do this version of the game, so maybe it just feels wrong to them. Thats all i know and all i really have to say. The game is great, and never has a single dull moment of gameplay. Its never ending chaos. So all you people having problem, hmmw well i'm not sure what to tell you. I'm sure i'll get lynched for this review, funny because if you dog a good game you get slaughtered, and if you like a potential(bad game) you still get dogged. So do as you wish. Everyone has an opinion, and this is mine, actually its a fact. And i can prove it.......i'll Youtube it.:D", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I feel for the people who have had problems.

Goodwin \"Florida Dragon\"", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "Never thought I would rate a COD game 3 stars, but there it is. Suprisingly, this game failed in many ways.The single player first: They are telling a story that bounces u all over the place between places and wars. It starts in the early sixties and takes you up to Vietnam. You are being questioned by unkown interigators and then it takes you to a mission you have to complete. Seomtimes, just as you are getting into the mission, it breaks and you are back in the interigation chair. This is repeated several times and gets a little frustrating. The gameplay is typical COD. Very exciting action with little time for taking in the scenery and anything else. you pretty much just keep running an firing just like every other COD game. You would think they could change it up a little, though getting non-stop action is not a bad thing, it just feels the same as all the other games. And the campaign gets shorter and shorter.Now, the MP: Laggy best describes it right now. It has gotten better, but still has rough moments. And the Mp plays like FEAR 2 which is not really a good thing. It looks and plays cheaply. The controls seem clunky and the maps, while not the bad, are not really awesome. Some are good and are wide open giving you less places to camp, but when you spawn in and die from a attack copter without being able to move, you start to hate it, especially when it happens 4 or 5 times in a row. Also, there is very little time between maps, and while I am sure some like this, it doesnt give you time to do things like create a class (which is a good thing when you get a new weapon or perk available) or purchase contracts. You have to leave the game you are playing make the change, and then hope you can get back in. Now, you do get money for kills and winning maps that you can spend to make purchases early, which is kind of cool, but not really all that cool. As for wager matches, I can barely find anyone playing those. Surprise I say as I didnt think that was all that cool. Mp needs more work and right now, Treyarch is working on another patch that is supposed to really fix most of the problems with lag and other issues, but I dont think it will be enough to make this game as good as the others.The graphics seema little better, but not much. Same with the sound. Not much impressed, sadly to say. As for the system requirments, not much has changed except that u need a good processor. I bought a new computer as my 3 year old CPU's processor wasnt good enough (need on anyways). I had dual AMD 64 and it wouldnt play. Oh well, one more thing  I guess.Anywasy, buy this at your own risk. I really believe Activision is gonna miss Infinity Ward and think if future releases of COD don't start getting it right and do something a little different, sales are gonna start dropping like a plane with no fuel and crash to a firey end.Heres to hoping things get better, but I ain't holding my breath.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Never thought...", "unixReviewTime": 1291507200, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2010"}

It's not perfect, but when compared to the earlier Treyarch releases it is much better and with luck will keep the series moving in a direction fans love. I have this game for the PC and the XBox 360 and I've not only enjoyed both, I've been impressed with how well the graphics look on my desktop:  the XBox 360 version renders remarkably well but it can't touch the quality of my desktop PC.What I love about the single-player campaign is that the story is intricate and contains some surprising twists to it--and what seals the deal is the history behind it. The story is set during the Vietnam War and also touches on the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs incident. There are a couple of things depicted in the game that aren't quite accurate, but it's been enjoyable getting details from Vietnam veterans I know (and from the Internet). It's still a very plausible campaign and there is enough variety in each level and its goals that you don't feel like you're being handed a map and a paltry excuse to shoot it up from one end to the other.When it comes to multiplayer, on the PC it can be a huge disappointment.  If you have friends you can group with on a closed map, you're in for a great time--otherwise, my experiences trying random pick-up maps left me worn out by all the cheating.  This isn't a rant about people who move faster; I was running across players who could pull the trigger anywhere on the map and you automatically die of a headshot, over and over, as their stats climb the boards.  On the PC I went to bot-matches and saved multiplayer for the more locked-down XBox 360 platform. I really enjoy the way mutliplayer feels though: it's not just the fact that the technology is fairly accurate to the times, it's that even without Modern Warfare styled gadgets you can get a lot of tactical fun out of running and gunning across the maps. We still have airdropped care packages and we still have the occasional ability to light up the map with a radar sweep that tags enemies with red dots.So the only thing really keeping Black Ops from a 5-star rating are some minor cons. Like with every shooter, you'll have moments where your feet get stuck or you can't move because you can't see the treestump next to your ankle that's blocking you. I've learned to forgive those moments because they happen in any game. With Treyarch's \"World at War\" there were times that the enemies seemed to be willing to spawn forever if you didn't move to tag the appropriate hotspot on the map. This happens a few times in Black Ops and it can lead to some real Groundhog Day style moments. The other con that I'm hoping goes away in future Call of Duty games is that there will be times a checkpoint triggers at the worst possible moment--and if you die, you respawn into a bad situation that may take you a dozen revives to get past. I only had this happen a couple of times, but it left me thinking, \"You have GOT to be kidding me!\" Frustrating, and sometimes it causes you to deliberately have to be foolhardy and rush in on a bad situation knowing you'll take a hit or two, because if you don't you'll be back to a bad respawn point. I'd rather push forward acting as if bullets are a bad thing that I can't just brush off by hiding for 10 seconds. It can get silly when some of the enemy AI are foolish enough to step out in front of you or stand next to cover, but at higher difficulties this happens less.Overall, if you like the Call of Duty series, this is a great entry into new territory. It's got an excellent storyline and while multiplayer is difficult without a closed group, both it and single player are loads of fun.TIP:  some people were having huge performance problems with this game (and may be still!)  There is a feature called 'Shader Warming' that will pre-cache shader graphics separately.  I enabled this setting, but some have reported that disabling Shader Warming helps them get better performance and stability.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Breathes New Life into an Old War", "unixReviewTime": 1355097600, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2012"}

Not to mention having constant flashbacks in different color filters, slightly out of focus, with the camera tilted slightly to the side gets old really fast, like after 5 minutes of this I was so bored and was actually talking out loud to my computer asking it, \"So when can I shoot more stuff?\"  What's even worse is that the option to skip these cinematics only works when it wants to.  So 90% of the time you have to watch these lame pointless cut scenes that add NOTHING to the story other than where your next mission is and what Communist you're going after next.  You'll find yourself hitting every button on your keyboard and clicking wildly in the vane hope that you'll be taken to the start of the mission.Also there are some pretty lame achievements, but there is no place in the game itself to look at a list of these achievements or descriptions of them in order to find out what you have to do to get them.  You have look on Steam to find that info.  And forget about Alt+Tabbing out of the game to check what achievements you can still get and then returning to the game cuz the game will crash as soon as you do that.This game shouldn't have been a stand alone game for 60 bucks.

It has the combat training, which is a nice addition, but they took away the co-op campaign that we were treated too with World at War. Thanks for screwing us like that guys. I can not believe that they would offer it in a past game and take it away. Doesn't every developer know that you can NEVER take away features once they are added. I guess the good developers know that, but these guys don't. They wonder why games like Halo, Gears and Rainbow Six are so successful, its because they give you a lot of options to play. These guys make me sick with their lack of regard for their customers.The other thing is that they continue to ruin zombie mode. What made the original zombie map in World at War so much fun was that you could put your back to a wall and just fight. With every subsequent map after that, they forced you to run around to different rooms to find the boxes. Then they added the very irritating feature of having the boxes dissappear at random and appear somewhere else. They force you to playt he game the way they want you too, instead of giving the user any level of control over some of the options. So with this iteratoin its the same thing, a huge level that you are forced to run all over to find the box, only to die by the time you do because you don't have any money or a good defensible location. I haven't unlocked the other two levels for zombie mode yet, but my hopes are incredibly low at this point.If they would have given us the co-op campaign that they promised, and not continued to downgrade and ruin zombie mode, I'd have scored this much higher. But I'm so irritated that they would take away the campaign's co-op feature. I love multiplayer just like a lot of other people, but NOT at the expense of a co-op campaign.

{"reviewerID": "A19EWLBR7O05FS", "asin": "B003JVKHEQ", "reviewerName": "A. Boothe", "helpful": [1, 4], "reviewText": "Im going to write this review to combat some of the negative reviews on here and maybe convince someone to pick this game up and give it a shot.This review is going to mostly focus on the multiplayer since I have only finished about a 3rd of the campaign.This game has taken all of the best elements from all the previous call of duty games, eliminated the things that didn't work, and the result is a nearly flawless online experience. Here are the issues that are fantastic additions/fixes to the series.CAMPINGWhere to start on this one, a combination of things have nearly eliminated this problem entirely.---------Better Map Design, multiple entry points to every location, no rooms with 1 major access point. This forces players to stick and move, get a few kills in an area and then move from that spot or at least readjust his strategy. Maps are smaller overall with no wasted space. There were areas in MW2 maps that people never went.---------No stopping power.Without this perk it is actually possible to survive a few bullets from someone who sees you first but has poor aim, which is usually the case for someone who resorts to sitting in a corner for easy kills. You can react and back out of the room, unlike in MW2, regardless of if you can aim or not most weapons take 2 bullets at most to kill you with stopping power and if you fire first you win 99% of the time.---------Killstreaks dont stack and are less effectiveNo more superoverpowered killstreaks in the air at all times. In MW2 you camp until you get 5 kills for a predator, then you are almost guaranteed to get to 7 for a harrier then 11 for choppergunner/Ac-130, rinse and repeat. You have to actually get kills with your gun, 11 killstreaks are a now more rare and not rewarded to anyone who can hide behind a barrel for 5 kills.--------Nerfing snipers and returning to pistol only secondaries.In Mw2 it was next to impossible to get a sniper out of a good hiding spot, you are no match at long range with any weapon other than a sniper rifle yourself, and at close range nothing was better than a shotgun or even worse akimbo shotguns, there was no tradeoff for a sniper. His weapon combo allowed him to have an advantage in nearly every scenario making the game unbalanced. Now they are relegated to a pistol which is far less effective allowing the advantage to swing for someone that can close the gap.The same applied to any long range weapon.UNBALANCED WEAPONS---MW2, all weapons effective at any range. In Black OPs recoil was added to the weapons, theres a thought, you have to aim when you shoot, or fire in bursts and not spray. Now every weapon has a trade off based on range. A M16 user will have the advantage over someone with and SMG at medium to long range, and if an SMG user gets up close he will have the advantage. Balance.CHEAP TACTICS-----Quickscoping, knife classes, noobtubers, explosive only classes, nuke boosters, akimbo shotguners...all gone----Sleight of hand beniefit removed from sniper rifles, damaged decreases and sway added = no quickcopers and best of all no quickscope lobby messages every 5 mins and will reduce the number worhless Youtube montage makers trying to get internet famous.----Noob tube dmage decreased, no danger close and one man army elimiates the noobtubers and other explosive only users----No commando, and lightweight speed decreased extremely eliminates the teleport knifers. Still could stand to be decreased more, people still occasionaly lunge knife through bullets.----No gaming ending killstreak, this combined with a tactical insertion was the worst idea of all by Infinity Ward. Take it out and no one will boost it.----Shotgun damage decreased and shotguns returned to primary only, can akimbo 1 set of shotguns but there effective range is probably half of what they used to be.OBJECTIVE GAMES ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE AGAINAnother huge but simple improvement is the demphasizing of the kill/death ratio. In previous games you clicked on the leaderboards and you were given a kill/death ratio based on kills through all games including objective games. People would obsess over this number to the point where every objective game in MW2 had 2 or 3 people on each team camping strictly for kills to get that number up and not playing the objective.This overall kill/death ratio number is still there but its buried deep in your combat record. When you click on the leaderboards you have kill/death ratios listed only for games where killing is the objective, Team Deathmatch, FFA etc. In the objective games it only keeps track of your captures, defends plants etc.The result is fun competitve objective games where the objective is the focus and not the kills. Now you cant pad your stats with a number overinflated by not playing the objective, and if you do, it only improves a number buried so far in your combat record that no one will ever bother to check it.ACCESS TO MORE EQUIPMENT/PERKS/ATTACHMENTS/WEAPONS FASTER DUE TO CREDIT SYSTEM--Now you can just buy what you want as you get teh credits. You still have to reach certain levels to be able to buy certain guns but now you can just buy whatever perks, attachments and equipment you like instead of having to wait to reach a certain level, or get so many kills with a certain scope. You can get what you want sooner.MORE CUSTOMIZATION--Endless amount of custom symbols can be created, you can buy the stuff you want and not have to do some ridiculous challenge to get a certain symbol, or boost headshots (eliminated another boosting problem). You can also customize your player model, face paint, reticle and lens type and colors, and put you clan tag and symbol on your gun.TREYARCH BRINGING THE BAN HAMMER---Infinity Ward let the MW2 run wild with more glitches and exploits than I've seen in every other game combined. Prestige glitchers, Private matches that let you gain xp, modded lobbies everything to infinite explosives, to faster running, and higher jumping. Javelin glitch, Infinite Care packages, hiding in rocks, elevators etc etc.Infinity ward patched some of it, others they never bothered, and through it all there was no penalty for any of it. Treyarch has resorted to banning these people and releasing updates to squash glitches as soon as they are discovered, not waiting months if ever to do anything.CONS (Cant get everything right)--I agree with some of the others on here about the sound. It is a lot harder to hear players coming now even with an expensive headset. This was done intentionally by Treyarch to prevent the sound-whoring, which results in camping or players ducking in corners constantly, but in my opinion it was done too much.Treyarch has acknowledged this however and are planning a patch to adjust the sound.--Dive to prone. Ridiculous and nobody really uses it effectively and it usually happens on accident resulting in you getting killed.--Matchmaking sometimes takes a really long time to get into a game with a party, or disbands the party entirely(Also being fixed by Treyarch)--Knife lunge range still a little ridculous (Also being adjusted in a future patch)Overall this is a fantastic game. It goes back to the roots of how FPS should be played. Its about the weapon in your hand again and you shooting better than the other guy. Not the kilstreaks or what cheap tactic you can come up with to get a kill. A large portion of the community loved these things, and got enjoyment out of Quickscoping, noob tubing, knifing etc. MW2 was a game made for the masses, they tried to include things so everyone can pick it up and get kills, Black OPS is not designed this way.When these things are removed and a player is forced to play the game right, he naturally wont do as well and will blame it on poor game design or whatever. With all his extra time he now has because he can no longer make Youtube quickscope videos, he can go online and post negative reviews about the game.Just take them with a grain of salt, If you like a game that takes skill and has to be played right then this is the game for you. Otherwise go back to MW2 and noob tube to your hearts content.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "COD, the way it was meant to be.", "unixReviewTime": 1291161600, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2010"}

I had not used it since the update which added dolly cams to the the mode, and all I can say about that is...WOW.  Theater mode is absolutely amazing.  It is a complete blast to work with and can provide hours of entertainment creating epic movie quality clips.  The only downside is that exporting the videos to a PC for storage (as only 6 slots are provided online) is nearly impossible.  However, I give great credit to Treyarch for this inclusion and I hope it finds its way into MW3.I am also quite glad (even though I predicted it before even the first map pack came out) that Treyarch has decided to cash in by offering the original World at War zombies maps as DLC for players who did not purchase the Hardened or Prestige editions of the game.  I had been planning to pay the price of a NEW GAME to buy the redeem code on eBay, where people were shamelessly selling it for a highly elevated price, but now I can get all of the maps AND a brand new one for a mere $15.I admit it, this is the only FPS that I ever play these days.  I love multiplayer and I love the zombies mode.  I don't love the frequent glitches and sketchy issues with hit detection, stab connection, longshot accuracy, and lag, but I do enjoy the experience as a whole.  However, the single player campaign is still BAD.  Please, Treyarch, fix this in the next installment in which you participate.ORIGINAL REVIEW:My experience with the CoD franchise began with Modern Warfare.  I have neither played nor heavily researched the older titles, so I can't really say what the original \"premise\" of CoD was.  Regardless, I believe that with new consoles and technology available, game franchises should evolve over time and include new features.  On the one hand, a complete shift in focus is not ideal (to use the example of a racing game, if Need for Speed, an arcade racer, suddenly released a full-blown simulator like Gran Turismo, that would be misguided and ill-received), but development to generate new interest and take advantage of new technologies should be a given.Call of Duty:  Black Ops has made some improvements over its predecessors, but not enough, and has even regressed in a few areas.  Rather than releasing a new game every year, perhaps Activision should \"slow their roll,\" so to speak, and develop a title free of bugs and horrible features that anger people and inspire ranting reviews such as several here at Amazon.com.  In addition, those who say \"there was nothing wrong with the original [insert game title here]\" can feel free to go play the original title.  Why limit the development of new games just because a dated title for an older console was good when it came out?Now, the game.Treyarch really made some great advances in the area of \"sharing the experience.\"  The biggest thing I can point to right away is the ability to play split-screen online.  My roommate and I enjoyed this opportunity to hit up the multiplayer portion of the game as a team.  Additionally, the new \"Combat Training\" mode offers either a crazy challenge on \"Veteran\" or a laughably easy Chuck Norris style massacre on \"Recruit,\" which again can be done split-screen.  Being able to play split-screen in private online matches is additionally a big plus because I can enjoy 2v2 deathmatches with my friend and his wife in another state.  I recently forgot that this was new to Black Ops and suggested we play the tiny MW2 map \"Rust\" in this fashion, only to realize that we could not.Multiplayer also has some great new features.  I'm a little divided on the \"purchase system\" which involves buying weapons and attachments with points earned during gameplay, rather than progressively unlocking these items, but I think it is a good working system.  Additions such as \"Second Chance Pro,\" which allows your teammates to revive you when you are downed, unique killstreak rewards (with no more annoying Tactical Nuke), and some enjoyable maps and environments make the experience fun and refreshed from prior installments.However, once you get past these good things, the game starts to fall apart.  First off, multiplayer is riddled with problems.  I won't say a word about the playing style of any gamer, because that is not a game flaw.  One of the biggest problems, though, is a sort of delay that affects one team or the other.  I often get instantly mowed down by someone after they pop out of cover, only to watch a killcam in which they take their sweet time aiming and shooting at me after moving from cover...as though I was offered a 1 second delay on my end of things.  I'm sure the same often happens to my opponents as well, explaining why they fail to shoot at me during games in which I am doing well.Another multiplayer problem is hit detection.  I have, on a number of occasions, unloaded on someone at point blank range, only to see the killcam (after they seem to drop me in one shot) indicating no hits on them.  These are fundamental problems that really need to be addressed by the game developers.Some people may claim that CoD IS multiplayer, and that single player modes are not even necessary.  I disagree.  The storyline in Modern Warfare was amazing, and a true joy to play through.  MW2 was a little less enjoyable, but still a good play.  I don't remember WaW very well because I played the other two again more recently, but it seemed pretty good as I recall.  Black Ops, however, has a terrible campaign.  Cut scenes and voice acting are good, as other reviewers have said, but first off the premise of the campaign is a terrible plot concept (a supposedly highly skilled soldier imagines the perpetual existence of a deceased Russian to the extent that this phantom man actually accomplishes tasks and kills enemies for him?).Second, realism completely failed.  Prior installments of CoD made references to \"careful development with soldiers and historians\" to ensure an accurate, period-correct experience.  Not the case with BO...about 50% of the available weapons in the game had not even been developed by the year in which the game is set.  A classic example is the SPAS-12 shotgun, which debuted in 1979.  The player is given one to use in the game's 1969.  A 10 year continuity error is not a \"minor discrepancy.\"Third, the AI is complete garbage.  Several other reviews address this issue, but the campaign eventually becomes boring and frustrating because your scripted teammates are worthless, the enemies are unreasonably good, single you out, and spawn infinitely on veteran, and there is really only ONE way to progress through the level, with extensive use of the \"trip-wire\" effect which basically involves plot advancing or enemies spawning when you reach a certain, invisible \"magic spot\" on the map.An unexpected boon to the game, however, is the revamped zombies mode.  I loved Nazi Zombies in World at War, and the fact that zombies returned in Black Ops was about 50% of my reason for buying the game (several months after its release, however...I am not THAT obsessed).  The first new map, Kino der Toten, is a brilliant design which, despite the recent DLC, is still the best map in my opinion.  New weapons (including an M1911 that actually sounds like a .45 pistol and not a pea shooter), new dialogue (though still annoyingly repetitive), and features such as useful Quick Revive on solo mode make the new zombies fresh and enjoyable.  However, even this unique game mode is not free of flaws.  Double-hitting zombies, ridiculous zombie strength in higher rounds, and various glitches make the mode sometimes infuriating.  In addition, the new DLC is frustrating and proves even more difficult, while hardly offering any bonuses to compensate for that fact.  Regardless of these annoyances, I still love playing zombies online with my friends, and at the time of this writing I have high hopes for the fourth and final DLC map.In summary, Black Ops debuted some new and enjoyable features but unfortunately was a letdown with a lousy campaign and some glitches that really should be ironed out by now.  I would recommend the game if you are a big fan of the CoD multiplayer experience and/or Zombies game mode, but if you are looking for a great single player storyline, don't even bother.  The weird story, interrupted constantly by dozens of cutscenes and riddled with historical flaws and atrocious AI, is not worth $60.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Try Just a Little Harder...", "unixReviewTime": 1306800000, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2011"}

As many of the reviews have said before me, the seventh installment of the COD series introduces gamers to the same tried and true formula everyone has grown to love (or hate) about this popular FPS. Run, gun, kill, die, respawn, repeat. Some absolutely love this type of gameplay, I guess they just get an adrenaline rush from it. So the people I'm talking about will no doubt give this game 5 stars. While I can get into this type of play, many players are already deciding to camp. The killcams prove my adversary was simply sitting near a wall with their weapon aimed for any unfortunate soul to run around the corner. The maps aren't as camp-friendly as MW2, but I see Black Ops turning into something very similar as more players progress and unlock more things. I for one don't want a 60's era MW2. Another aspect of this game I feel has taken a step back are the maps. A couple stand out, but the most frequently played were dull and boring. Also, the weapons sound terrible. They sound like WaW, hollow. I guess it's a Treyarch thing. I see a lot of other reviewers agree with my opinion of this game. They don't want another MW2 and I can't blame them. Why spend $60 on a game that takes many aspects of the former and incorporates them into a different setting. I still get knifed from 10 feet away and there are care-package drops, obviously copied from MW2. Now I understand many people will find this game amazing. That's great, I'm glad you enjoy it. But after playing MW, WaW and MW2, I'm looking for something different. I know GOW3 and Crysis 2 are coming soon.

{"reviewerID": "A32O98PFC3OP7K", "asin": "B003JVKHEQ", "reviewerName": "A Gamer at Heart", "helpful": [2, 4], "reviewText": "With great fanfare arrives the next iteration in the Call of Duty franchise.  I will only discuss the multiplayer at this point because realistically, I believe the majority of gamers will be buying this game to play it online.When I first jumped on-line, I was immediately struck with how familiar the game play felt. The phrase \"evolution, not revolution\" really comes to mind in describing the game play.  I felt like I was playing a re-skinned version of MW2.  The controls are exactly the same, which is good, but nearly everything else about the game play itself just feels a little overly familiar.  Calling in the recon plane, stopping an enemy just short of a kill streak, etc., it all just felt like I was still playing MW2 but on new maps.Ironically, even though this is the next installment of the franchise, the graphics seem a bit drab and generic, at least on some of the maps.  It appears to be a different graphics engine, and it lacks the polish and detail that was present in MW2.  The character animations look pretty generic.  In the end, it is really the game play that matters(and it is very good), but I was surprised the graphics appear inferior to MW2.Leveling up and acquiring new weapons, attachments, and perks has been changed up a bit.  You still generate XP, which moves you up the ladder to different levels, level 1, 2, 3, etc.  What's new is that as you acquire XP, you also accumulate COD points.  As you level up, you will unlock new weapons as before, but rather than having to complete challenges to unlock new weapon attachments, multiple attachments are simultaneously available that you can purchase with your COD points.  Think of it like this:  Your XP is the cover charge into the bar, but you still need money in your pocket to buy the drinks you want.  I like this approach because I don't want to waste time unlocking an ACOG scope that I won't use so I can get to the unlock for a red-dot scope, which I will use. This ability to customize is an improvement on MW2.Aside from straight kills, another way to generate COD points is to purchase contracts, which offer a COD point reward upon completion.  Some are pretty attainable, like killing three enemies in a row without dying.  You pay 25 points to purchase that contract and gain 250 when you complete it.  Another contract involves using your knife to kill a single opponent.  There are contracts that appeal to all play abilities and offer a nice new, personal goal to attain when playing online.  I like this concept because it offers additional goals beyond just trying to have a decent kill/death ratio.  Each contract has a cooling period where you can't repurchase it until a specified period of time has passed.You can also still customize your emblem, although you now get to pay for the privilege with your COD points.  I am not sure how much I like having to pay for this ability, but I must admit the first time I saw my customized emblem adorned on my weapon as a new \"gun emblem\" I was pretty impressed.  Another nice new feature is the ability to save or upload movies of your matches.  That is pretty welcome.Finally, there is a combat training mode that allows you to play all the maps against bots offline. (although you must be online to play it).  The bots are actually pretty good at simulating a real opponent, and this mode allows you to get familiar with each map without getting slaughtered on-line.  You can also unlock most of the same weapons and attachments, so you can try out new weapons and tactics without sacrificing a few matches to learn whether you like them or not.  A cool feature of the training mode is that the bots are all named from your friends list, rather than generic, computer-generated names.  I was laughing out loud when I was killed by my friends, or vice versa, when they weren't really playing.  I thought it was a nice touch to personalize it this way and it really adds to the immersion that you are playing a real on-line match.  This mode will be excellent to learn all the little hiding spots that snipers will exploit on-line.Speaking of snipers, after putting in a fair amount of gameplay, I should point out that the map design seems improved over MW2.  The variety of maps is excellent, and vary from spread out areas to close quarter battle maps.  The ability to quick scope or camp and snipe are happily gimped.  The weapons balance is also excellent - the weapons you start with in multiplayer allow you to compete against higher ranked players just fine.  So far, I haven't encountered any uber-weapons that seem unbalanced and unfair.The popular zombie mode is also present, which when combined with the training mode, online mode, and single player campaign, really provide a fair amount of content for your gaming dollar.  If you liked MW2 and are ready for a subtle, but not overwhelming change, you should be pleased with Black Ops.  You will immediately feel at home, but it is fresh enough to be a comfortable second home.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Something New, Something Old, Something Borrowed . . .", "unixReviewTime": 1289347200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2010"}

I just want to say that it is fun to play overall. Let's start with single player.SINGLE PLAYER:The campaign took me about 7 hours on regular difficulty and it was fun. I just thought there were too many cutscenes, even though I skipped most of them anyway. I wouldn't skip the campaign if you get this game. 8.7/10ZOMBIES:Same as World at War, only with different maps now. I'm not a zombie fan so this held my attention for about 10 minutes. They should have put some spec-ops mode in this game, zombies is just not a good enough replacement because it gets boring fast. Spec ops, on the other hand, was always fun and took about 30 hours to beat the whole thing. 4/10MULTIPLAYER: (I'm going to split this into a few parts)Player match: Same as every other cod game, so this part of the multiplayer portion has gotten quite stale for me. The same recycled CoD formula just doesn't do it. It's either that, or the maps are too dull. But overall you should like this. 7/10Combat Training: This is tons of fun especially if you put the bots on recruit difficulty. It does get boring after a while and after being level 50, there's not much left to do. But if you put it on Veteran it is quite difficult. I'd say hardened is the most balanced difficulty. I would recommend trying this out if you're getting sick of losing on player matches. 8/10Theater Mode: Yes, I'm adding this in because I love it. You can watch old games and edit clips and whatever. Change camera angles, watch it from other player's perspectives, and a bunch of other stuff. I just can't figure out how to make it slow motion when recording. 9.5/10Wager Matches: This is my favorite. I hate sticks and stones because you always get hit with a tomahawk and then you are put in last place. I hate that game mode so much. Sharpshooter is fun because every game has different weapons. I destroyed everyone on my first match then I kept losing after that. Gun game is good, I won probably 10 out of the 50 matches I played in gun game. It's fun until you are in 6th place for like 10 games in a row. And finally, one in the chamber is the best of them all. You get one bullet and three lives, and you get a life for every knife and/or kill with a bullet. I would check that mode out. It's especially fun if you have a friend over and play it split screen so you can work together and screen-cheat when one of you gets out. 9/10Overall, I would buy this game.Wow that review was a lot longer than I thought.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good game overall", "unixReviewTime": 1292198400, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2010"}

As a sniper in CoD I was really shocked to see the measures they took to keep \"Quick Scoping\" from ever happening. I feel this is sort of ridiculous. Quick scoping is extremely difficult to even do, and they block that but keep grenade launcher attachments? It just seems that the developers never listen to our actual opinions. They have never truly improved on the game, in my opinion. I sold the game, and am glad I did.

For the cost it seemed like a great bargain to test out the new technology so no regrets on this end.One of the main motivators for me to make the plunge was the promise of more 3D gaming and when I found out that COD was making the leap into the fold well for me that was the tipping point of investment.How did it pan out? ****ing awesome!!!

I had a one year love/hate relationship with MW2 - that game is so addicting, fun, and maddingly frustrating.  It was my first online multiplayer game ever (I've since gone back and played MW1; man, that was a gem!).  However, I was getting very annoyed with all the exploits of certain perks and attachments (you should know the ones I mean).  And the two overpriced and blah map packs further drove me away.But, after two months with Black Ops, I find that I'm being driven back to MW2.  Even as far back as MW1.  Yes, the perks and attachments are more balanced, but just not enough to overcome the game's flaws.  I find the graphics and colors to be dull and unexciting, the sounds underwhelming, and the physics engine/gameplay slow and boring.  And I've discovered that the pro versions of certain perks are those that frustrated me the most in MW2 (unlimited sprint and no damage falls).  Instead of eliminating the throwing knife, we get the tomahawk AND the ballistic knife.  Instead of eliminating the noob tube, we still have it and it's stealthier cousin the exploding crossbow bolts.  The list can go on and on.  Well, they did eventually nerf the panic knifing to bearable levels.  And then the problems with the matchmaking lobby, seemingly endless connection problems, and issues with playing with a party.  Granted, Treyarch is working on that, but couldn't they have released a fully operational product after SOME beta testing rather than sell us a beta product at full MSRP and have us suffer for a month or so?  It got so bad that I could not play BO even if I wanted to.  Another reason for going back to MW2.Bottom line, the formula came to this: BO=MW2a.  It's just an interative change from MW2, but with degraded gameplay, graphics, and sound.  Playing Black Ops seems more of a chore that I have to do to build up my perks (getting those pro versions are a real pain).

This one is nowhere near any of its predecessors (except maybe Call of Duty 3).The Zombies thing is standard affair, and the multiplayer takes a lot from Modern Warfare 2, adds a lot of new things, but overall still feels the same as World at War's multiplayer (which isn't really a bad thing; my biggest problem with WaW's multiplayer was that bolt-action rifles were made virtually pointless against machine guns) including identical menus and perk icon designs.It may definitely be a troublesome task trying to pick between this and MW2 for casual multiplayer gaming.The single player campaign, however, is a total disaster, by the standards set in every Call of Duty game since COD4, or perhaps even COD2.The story:- The story doesn't even begin to come into shape until mid-way through the campaign.  It starts with Generic Loner Badass Alex Mason, the guy with virtually the same name as the guy from Red Faction: Guerrilla, and so badass, John F Kennedy tells him directly he's the best they've got, in a pretty non-Cold War looking room full of television screens, apparently strapped into a chair and being questioned angrily by a distorted voice.  Every mission save for the last are in the form of flashbacks from this location.Alex Mason is painfully unlikeable, with no personality and no real redeeming traits, and the acting done by Sam Worthington with him is so painfully dull, or painfully overacted, it makes his \"Avatar\" performance look Oscar-worthy.  At no point in the game did I care about what he was doing or what was wrong with him.In fact, I realized he was pretty stupid for a CIA agent and BEST FIGHTER GUY IN THE EVAR, given not only the poor decisions made for the control interface (such as taking twice as long now to throw back grenades, or being unable to pilot a Hind to have it rise up or down, while being able to do everything else in it).  The plot twist at the end involving Reznov was alluded to, which helped in making the preceding scenes not seem stupid in hindsight, came about quite confused and unclear, and Alec Mason's brutish reaction to it is the sort of thing that, given that there is a TIMER RUNNING on the DESTRUCTION OF THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND PERHAPS THE ENTIRE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, makes him cartoonishly buffoonish, especially given that this plot twist has virtually NOTHING TO DO with the very ending in stopping this aforementioned destruction.The story is so convoluted, that I honestly don't even remember what the first five or six missions were, and why.  It just seemed like they were there solely for the action.  Which you'd think would be a given for a video game, but this is not exactly commonplace in the Call of Duty franchise.  Considering the Jason Bourne-style rapidfire incoherence they approach it with, it might be a short stretch to say they were intentionally attempting to fill the game up with confusing early missions filled with nonstop action.When it finally gets to the story itself, it involves the Soviet Union attempting to wipe out the United States using a nerve gas called NOVA-6 that causes quick death, and is planned to be launched on the US mainland in several dozen spots, to pretty much destroy the entire country and its entire population.  Such a direct, apocalyptic action, given the theory of Mutually Assured Destruction, with both the US and USSR posessing over 9000 nuclear weapons each, the sanity, or even basic common sense of such a plan is... pretty nonexistent.  I know the Soviets were villainized harshly by the Americans, but I highly doubt they and their leaders were suicidal, homicidal, genocidal cretinsThe Missions:- The first few missions are a scatter-brained assortment of big set pieces with obscenely copious amounts of gunfire and explosions.  While scenes like the Bay of Pigs are surprisingly accurate with regards to scope, it still feels excessive with the sheer amount of gunfire that gets poured into you, and the enemy, in just the few minutes the level lasts, which amplified over the course of three days, would become excessive; the actual Bay of Pigs had between 100-200 dead, and 500+ wounded (not including civilians); the way it's depicted in the game, this all would possibly fit into the few minutes depicted.Virtually every level is a colossal mess of hundreds of soldiers (endlessly respawning, of course), constant explosions, a cacaphony of nutty weapons that I often question even existed in the 1960s (such as a proto-version of the Thermal Scope in MW2, or gun-mounted flamethrowers that somehow don't melt the gun's barrel after constant use, or high powered assault rifles with five different attachments on it), and gore that gets so copious, it becomes cartoonish; like shooting a soldier in the hand with a pistol, and having his ENTIRE HAND AND WRIST be blown off.  Or worse; shooting once at a soldier on a motorcycle, while also on a motorcycle, and having him literally explode into a vapor of small pieces of gore.- But the single worst, most frustrating thing about the missions is the legendarily thick AI.  I have NEVER seen AI this atrocious in the Call of Duty series since only the last mission of Call of Duty 4 (on Veteran Mode) with Ssgt. Griggs rushing out into the open, standing in front of an enemy, and shooting wildly in random directions.At least 70% or 80% of all missions will be You vs an Army, because your allies rarely, if ever, hit anything, and they ALWAYS take a few seconds before even RECOGNIZING an enemy soldier; I could not count the times a friendly unit would simply RUN PAST an enemy unit, and that enemy unit of course ignoring them and targeting ME exclusively.This sort of stupidity is even scripted, as in one sequence a group of friendlies is ambushed by Vietcong soldiers, and as one of them is shooting a friendly soldier dead, one of your allies rushes up to him, holding his assault rifle near his waist, Hollywood-style, the gun jams, he looks down at it, struggles to fix it, and the Vietcong soldier turns around, LOOKS AT HIS GUN, then uses his own gun to bash the man upside the head.  THIS MAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN INSANELY WELL-TRAINED SPECIAL OPS SOLDIER.Another frustrating problem, almost as bad as the horrendous AI, is actually SEEING who is an enemy and who isn't.  Whereas in the WW2 games, people wore uniforms, and even in Modern Warfare 2, you could tell who the OpFor agents were, due to their haphazard attire and occasional turbans, or who Russians were based on their dark red fatigues, here, EVERYONE IS DRESSED EXACTLY THE SAME in the same assortment of pants or jeans, shirts, vests, jackets, masks, headpieces, ALL DARK.  The only people not dressed this way are Vietcong and NVA soldiers (and Nazis in a flashback mission).The horrendous AI doesn't help with this either; there's such a gape in the reaction time for enemy AI, that I've never EVER adapted to turning a corner, seeing someone there, and just waiting for a full second to see if they're a friendly, or if they shoot me, or if I end up shooting at them and they turn out to be an ally.Another incredibly frustrating element is the Hind piloting.  Alex Everyman gets to do BOTH the piloting AND the shooting, and the limitations means that while you can't crash your helicopter into caverns or walls or upside big ships (which is a good thing) you also can't elevate or descend (which is a very very bad thing).  There comes a point in one mission where you have to destroy two opposing Hinds, and you're all alone.  The missiles do NOT lock on in ANY way, and the enemy Hinds CONSTANTLY rise and descend to avoid YOUR incoming fire, whereas YOU can not.  Sometimes, they will even fire DOWN at you, with you unable to hit them unless you turn on your side, strafing wildly and trying to shoot at them while you're moving at high speed.  Add to the frustration for achievement-hunters, there is an achievement for accomplishing this mission WITHOUT using the Hind's cannons, and ONLY using its rockets.  The rockets are infinite, but they reload slowly.  Fatally slow, up against the two Hinds, if you're not a good shot.The Weapons:- Like I mentioned before, I think there's a slight credibility gap with regards to some of the weapons in the game, or weapon upgrades which seem either ridiculous, a bit of a stretch to picture existing in the 1960s, or incredibly goofy.  A gun with a bottom-mounted flamethrower is an awesome thing in game, but I've never seen or heard of this being used before, and it would seem to me that, given where the flame begins, continued use would melt the gun barrel.  There's a neat variety of guns, perhaps more than in Modern Warfare 2.One of the great things is that most of the guns have a more realistic sound than in previous games, more like firecrackers than bombs.The multiplayer has a new system of upgrading in which you do not unlock weapons, perks, or upgrades in a linear way, but you earn \"money\" in each match, and use it to purchase weapons, perks, upgrades, etcetera.  This is neat, as you can choose to unlock a laser sight ahead of a grenade launcher, or to unlock your favorite Assault rifle before your favorite Shotgun, but this introduces a whole new issue, which would probably not be an issue for many players:It renders certain upgrades useless.  Why bother to buy Laser sight, when you can get a better sight, or a Reflex sight, which is exactly the same, and only different in aesthetics?  Why upgrade something you don't like?  Why buy a perk you never use?  With previous games, you could unlock certain things by kills, and unlock other things by kills using certain upgrades (such as unlocking Holographic sights by getting 60 kills with Laser sights), essentially forcing you to use virtually every upgrade in order to unlock the rest.The Characters:- There are the standard character archetypes here; the Generic Loner Badass protagonist, the Token Black Guy (who obviously dies first), the Sidekick Guy, the Scrappy, the Tough All-Business Veteran Guy, the Nerdy Politician (voiced by Robert Picardo), etcetera.  None of them are particularly interesting.Most of all, Alecks Mason, is called the BEST THEY HAVE and treated like a testosterone-souped Mary Sue, complete with no evidence of why he is the BEST THEY HAVE, no likeable characteristics, a dull tone of voice, total lack of charisma, and either a below average intelligence, or very poor judgement.  I found myself smacking my forehead, calling him such an idiot as, towards the end, he needlessly punches the guy trying to help him, and trying to SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM TOTAL DESTRUCTION just so he can stumble about in a drugged haze, and then get punched in return later on.However, there is the appearance of Viktor Reznov, Sergeant from World at War, boistrously performed by Gary Oldman.  With the dullness of playing as Alex Mason all game wearing me down, a flashback mission from October 1945 with me as Reznov, and also speaking, I was rejuvenated, and found myself actually having fun instead of going through the motions with the game.  We also get to see Dimitri Petrenko from World at War, and him speaking, but it's nothing remarkable.  It's also refreshing to hear music from World at War returning for the flashback mission.Possibly the single biggest problem I have with the characterizations is that they all behave like movie stars in a generic Hollywood action flick.  The military professionalism of the special ops teams and armies in the Modern Warfare series was taut and compelling and COOL.  Here, the actors chomp scenery madly, spouting lines with ridiculous intonation, a total lack of professionalism among them.  There's no dry humor or wisecracks, military-slanged quips, or \"Cut the chatter!\"s, but tons of \"Hell yeah!\" and \"Kick some ass!\" and all other sorts of adolescent trash talk.Playing through the campaign was a dismal, frustrating, boring experience.  The multiplayer is not any MAJOR improvement over Modern Warfare 2, and its true staying power may, as with World at War, lie with its Commie Zombie functions.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Big dumb mess", "unixReviewTime": 1294272000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2011"}

Probably the best campaign in all of the CoD series. Decent story and kept you entertained for pretty much the whole time you were playing. I also liked how it involved certain things from World at War.As for the Multiplayer, it is horrible! One example I have come across, actually let me rephrase that, this has happened to me many many times. Anyway, I have a guy from the opposite team running away from me, I shoot him with the 30 or so bullets in my gun, odd he is not dead yet seeing that I heard the bullets hit through my speakers, I reload to try and shoot this 'terminator' some more, by that time though he realized I had been shooting him, he turns in a blink of an eye does some stupid jump and fires 'one' bullet at me (not a sniper rifle), doesn't hit my head, and kills me instantly. If that is not bad enough, I watch the kill cam and from his view he turned, jumped, and fired two feet from my character's body, yet some how the game thought that the air next to me was part of my body. I think that description is enough to say this game is garbage in the multiplayer department.Okay, This might happen more times than I like but I am not bad at the game either, there are times when I can get 27 kills and 3 deaths, and that is without killstreaks like chopper gunner or dogs. Other times, I have to shoot someone with a whole clip to kill them and they are right in front of me. The whole game is set on the host and the host team. If you are not on the host team I recommend hiding and camping because it is the only way you are going to have a decent kill/death ratio by the time the round ends.Another horrible thing about multiplayer, is when a high ranking character comes into the lobby. The host connection is set to them no matter if his connection is bad or not. I think this is true because of a number of reasons. One, is everyone that had 4 bar connections are now 3 or 2 bars. Second, I will be in a room with a guy that is getting really good kill/death ratios and right as someone that is a better rank than him comes into the room and kicks him to the non-host team, he is trash.

As it loaded, I kept thinking, \"There's no way this game is as great as everyone saysohmygosh this is awesome!\" The single player campaign completely arrested me until I finished it (good thing it was short, or I would have been sitting there awhile) and the multiplayer was such a breath of fresh air after living in HALO's repetitive shadow for so long.A year later: we have BLACK OPS, from a different studio with the aim of giving us a CoD experience from a yet-to-be-endlessly-exploited era. The Cold War. I kept my expectations pretty low, considering I wasn't the biggest fan of Treyarch's last CoD entry, WORLD AT WAR. Good thing I did; low expectations are easy to meet, especially if you tread on familiar ground.The campaign follows operative Alex Mason, a man who wakes up in an interrogation room just in time to be tortured and drugged into recalling certain memories involving his military service. The purpose of the interrogation isn't entirely clear, though anyone with an interest in Cold War conspiracy theories can probably figure it out sooner rather than later. Mason relives his contributions to the Bay of Pigs, Vietnam, and some rather interesting black ops missions that take place in the background of all of these conflicts.The story itself isn't revolutionary by any means, but it's much easier to follow and much deeper than its predecessor, MODERN WARFARE 2. Let's face it, Treyarch had a win on their hands no matter what they did, but they saw fit to provide a campaign that's exciting and competently channels that Cold War anxiety. Not to mention the enjoyable and expertly-voiced characters (many props to Gary Oldman for making Viktor Reznov so memorable) and beautiful level design.That's not to say it was perfect. I can't really explain it, but as I was playing through the campaign, I just didn't attain that sense of involvement that I felt with MW2. The AI was pretty stupid and there were levels that just felt like your standard \"shoot everyone to complete mission\" stage. And little things like not being able to control the camera during certain \"cutscenes\" gave me a sense of disconnect. That said, I can't say that I enjoyed this campaign MORE than MW2's, but I could tell that a lot of effort went into it, bringing it up to a close second place in my book.Basically, if you're buying this game for the campaign just as much as the multiplayer, I don't think you'll be disappointed. I certainly wasn't, though a few of the choices kept it from reaching the level of immersion MW2's campaign provided. But how can you beat personally receiving a mission from President Kennedy?Now, the multiplayer. There's not much I can say that hasn't been said. From my own experience, it's just as addicting and just as fun as MW2's multiplayer. Honestly, not much has been changed up with the formula, save for the changes that come with the Cold War era. But a BIG change that I absolutely adore is the ability to watch, save, and edit replays of any multiplayer match you've played in the last seven days (limited to 100 matches, I think). You can make little montages, take screenshots, and then upload them to the CoD website so you can share them with people. I've had a lot of fun messing around with it so far.In the end, this is another CALL OF DUTY game that doesn't drop the ball. The campaign is entertaining and well-written, and the multiplayer is more of the same (albeit with a different theme), but \"the same\" is still pretty dang fun.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "What's new is old again", "unixReviewTime": 1290038400, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2010"}

I hold Treyarch to pretty high standards & unfortunately Blops falls short. More specifically in the multiplayer aspect. The single player & zombie modes are the saving grace, both very fun much like WaW's. I'm not going to compare this game to WaW however, because that's just not fair. The multiplayer is in my opinion very poor. First & foremost, the netcode & latency are THE WORST in a CoD to date. Proven in the killcam, you think you turned a corner to safety & when you watch yourself die you can see yourself standing there like a dufus through the eyes of your enemy. The next & just as big of a problem are the weapons, they don't work. They removed stopping power & claimed to have just included it into the weapons themselves. My friends & I think that that is a complete joke, it takes forever to kill someone. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the weapons are innacurate as well. Now I'm all for somewhat of a challange, but they really just handed you a pile of junk & expected us to go along with their \"bullet dance\", (look it up.) No thanks. The emblem customization is fun & cute n all, the maps are solid & the single player is one of the better ones, but unless you plan to play the multi as a drunk party game with friends, or like me was able to get this game for 20 some bucks....I'd skip it.

It seems like the annual release of the next installment in the iconic first-person shooter series should be a national holiday, given how many people attend the midnight launches for the game and no doubt skipped work or school the next day (myself included). Having hit the apex of popularity with Modern Warfare 2, the big question is how Black Ops will compare. I don't live and die by COD games as some people do, but I can say that Black Ops is one of the most satisfying and intense shooters I've ever played, with the best campaign out of all the games in the series and a multiplayer aspect that I can finally enjoy.Perhaps I'm the odd one, but I mainly buy these games for the single-player campaign as I am not the best at online shooters. The campaign in Black Ops is easily the best out of the series, with more cohesive storytelling and a more satisfying conclusion than the previous entries. Set in the Cold War era (early to late 1960's), you fight your way through diverse terrain in Russia, Cuba, and Vietnam, among other locations. As with other games in the series, you play as two main characters and you go back and forth between their missions. Without giving too much away, the story is pretty stock, but the manner in which it's told and presented is a big step forward for the COD series, which has lately felt like a batch of multiplayer games with a brief single-player campaign tacked on. Black Ops gives players a better experience in this regard, and despite being brief (7 hours roughly), it doesn't feel too short or seem to end as abruptly as the Modern Warfare games. The difficulty settings are standard for the series, and for achievement/trophy hunters, the biggest rewards come when playing on \"Veteran\" difficulty.The style of gameplay, the weapons and the linear design is all par for the course, but Treyarch has done a wonderful job at bringing this era and the surroundings to life. The cinematic quality that made Modern Warfare 2 such a hit is still intact here, and the graphics and sound are as amazing as you would expect. What I've always enjoyed about the COD games are the tight controls, and Black Ops will fit like a glove for any FPS fan. The multiplayer, undoubtedly the biggest day of Black Ops, is surprisingly accessible for people like me who typically get owned when going online. The focus is on class creating and experience points, and while I've only played a couple of hours, everything seems to run smoothly and without lag. My only fear is that the usual frustrations, such as campers and rude teenagers acting like idiots, will eventually creep in, but I'll be optimistic and see how things play out.I don't believe in gushing over games and hailing them as the \"Best Game EVAR!\", so I'll avoid hyperbole and simply say that Black Ops one of the better FPS games that I've played. If I have any negative feedback, it surrounds some of the difficulty spikes and the dumb-as-bricks AI of your teammates (and some enemies), but that was the same case with Modern Warfare 2 and especially World at War.

I can't read any of the small or medium size text in the game. I have to squint and feel my way around the menus. I know, I'm 10 years behind the times and need to get an HDTV right.The sound alone in Black Ops knocks it down to 2 stars right off the bat. I have a crappy TV, but my speakers are quite good. The sound in this game is just dreadfully bad. It feels like I'm playing with ear muffs on.The same BS we had to put up  with in MW2 multiplayer is back. Horrible spawn system. Shooting an enemy 15 times in the chest only to have him knife you. The most annoying things is when I unload an entire mag into an enemy, he doesn't die, he fires what feels like a few shots and I die.  I haven't had fun playing the multiplayer yet. At least in MW2 I could act like a fool, whip out the riot shield, scavenger, and cover the entire map in smoke bombs for fun.The currency system is a twist. I find the contracts to be more work than fun. Feel like if I don't purchase them I'm wasting an opportunity. When I do buy them I get anxiety about having to stick to a certain weapon or tactic in the allotted time.I played the first campaign mission and was pretty bored. No reason to buy this game if you are only going to play the campaign. Rent it for the campaign, buy it for the multiplayer.Ultimately, I'm disappointed in Black Ops.

It is much more like World at War.  I just love being spawned into the same air strike that killed me or literally right in front of an enemy.  Shipment (MW, Infinity Ward) was a small map.  So, there is kind of an excuse.  But, on a big one?  I am disappointed to say the least.  Yes, it's COD.  Yes, it's fun despite many annoyances.  But, this is no replacement for MW2.I have been a COD fan since CODII.  When I played 3, I noticed something just wasn't right without even paying attention to the fact that it was made by Treyarch as opposed to Infinity Ward.  Well, all of their games have the same lackluster polish when compared to Infinity Ward equivalent.  The pace of multiplayer is much faster, yes.  But the maps are generic, the action inconsistent, single player storyline not as good, graphics and sound not as good, etc. etc.I gave up my $20 credit when I cancelled my preorder from reach to apply it.  Then I cancelled my order.  They brought the credit back, I ordered.  I didn't get my game on release date.  All that drama.  For this.  Where MW is a 10 in my book, MW2 is a 9.5. And this stale Dorito would be a 7.5.  I actually like World at War better to be honest.  Oh well. At least it has zombies and co-op campaign.  I hope that they don't try to get $15 a map pack for this game.  The next time that I want to buy a game from Treyarch, I will rent first.  I recommend that you do the same.

Then there is Zurk which is a really old game from the early 80's. It is a game in which you type a command to tell the game what to do next like go North or South.

{"reviewerID": "A355YWQ2CWZTZ3", "asin": "B003JVKHEQ", "reviewerName": "Bowman373", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "This game is lots of fun. I will cover the different modes of the game in their respective sections below.Campaign:In my opinion, the campaign of BO is one of the best I have played and is very well written! I won't spoil it for you, but this is the basic story. It is set in the 1970's. You start as Alex Mason, an American soldier being interrogated about information concerning the location of a numbers station. You play through flashbacks of what happened to Mason and other members of his squad during the Cold War and Vietnam War leading up to when he was being interrogated. You play through many different enviornments such as jungles in Vietnam, military outposts in the snowy Ural Mountains, and even in a Soviet cosmodrome. The game loosely follows real history, including dates of events, famous political figures, and battles. It is very entertaining, providing many hours of gameplay. The campaign on Veteran difficulty is not too hard, but brutally hard on some points of the game. There are lots of vehicles to drive or fly, and many cool sequences. There are also intel items to find during the game, and each piece of intel reveals a cool feature in the menu. The game has very talented voice actors, such as Ice Cube, Gary Oldman, and Sam Worthington.Multiplayer/Combat Training:The multiplayer of this game is very fun. There are 50 levels to progress through, and there is a different system of how you unlock different weapons. In Black Ops, you use a currency called Call of Duty Points, and they can be used to purchase Weapons, Attachments, Perks, Emblems, Titles, and Equipment. After every game that you play, you earn a specific number of Call of Duty Points, varying on how well you did or if you completed a Contract (challenges that reward you with XP and CODPoints). I personally like this system better then the ragular system because when I unlock a weapon, I can get whatever Attachment I want for it right away instead of having to use it for a long time before I can. You can also buy Lethal and Tactical Grenades, Equipment, and Perks whenever you want, as long as you have enough money. CODPoints can also be used to buy different symbols for customizable emblems and titles for your online profile. Unfortunately, CODPoints cannot be shared with friends, so if you're low on cash, you'll just have to earn it. Another great feature is Wager Matches, where you gamble CODPoints with other players. There are many game modes, such as the Gun Game, where if you get 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place, you earn some of the winnings from the bets. It is a very fun way to earn CODPoints if you do well. Another feature is called Combat Training, where you fight offline against AI enemies either alone or with friends. It's just like regular multiplayer, except you can play with AI players on your team and on the enemy team. You also rank up in Combat Training, but it's a different rank then in Multiplayer. It's very fun because you can choose what map and what gametype you play. You can even choose the difficulty of the AI, so you can play against terrible Recruits or lethal Veterans. It also very useful for sampling different perks, guns, and attachments so you're not wasting your money in real Multiplayer.Zombies:Zombies mode is back, and it's bigger and better. If you're not familiar, Zombies mode is where you fend off endless waves of zombies, which progressively get harder. Up to 4 people can play via Xbox LIVE or Split-Sceen. You earn points for each Zombie killed and each barricade fixed. You use those points to open doors and buy Perks and Weapons. If a player gets killed by the zombies, his teammates can revive him to get him back up, or if he dies, he respawns the next round. Zombies mode is very addicting and I recommend you get the map packs for Zombie maps.Overview:I would definitely recommend this game to a friend because it has a great Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies mode.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Fun Game!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1334016000, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2012"}

So the pace of the game, in conjunction with the weapons of that time, I found to my liking.  It didn't have the faster pace of recent COD's and the firepower wasn't nearly as overwhelming.

This game is alright but overrated. I will review the multiplayer mode only.This is one of those games where it's one shot and you're dead. I don't like it because it's inaccurate. It doesn't seem like it lags but maybe it does. Because when I watch the kill-cam, it shows someone shooting me before I shoot them, even though I thought the opposite. With better games like Halo you know where you're at on the map and trust the objects on the map. But with this inaccurate game, you can be taking cover behind a truck but still die. When I watch the kill cam it shows me acting stupid, sticking my head out or something, or like I'm not even next to the truck. It's like sometimes I'm facing someone but can only see their arm yet they can see my whole body. Like other COD games you can shoot through walls too.I think the reason I play this game is because it lets me unlock weapons and stuff. Every time I want to switch to a new game, it lets me buy another weapon, making the game a bit more interesting.The reason why this game is funner than games like GOW3 is that it has many multiplayer options. It has about the same modes as before, but much more than any other game besides Halo. There is capture the flag and territory games, but more than that too. I like that you get to use special equipment like cameras and radar sensors. So it's fun because you get all these options, many weapons, equipment, and kill strike attacks. And there are many maps and multiplayer options too. You can decorate your gun and your face. So there is alot of stuff to do.I really don't like the game-play very much, it's too fast and inaccurate. It's not just me, watching the kill-cam, I notice that the average person shoots at other player's feet or something lame. The graphics aren't very good either. The story mode is fun but unrealistic.I don't know about Modern Warfare, but this game is almost exactly like WAW, including the graphics. So whether you like this game or not don't pretend like it's too different than any other COD game out there.The best part of this game and the reason why I kept the game is the mini zombie game. Unlike the WAW game, there aren't any major hackers. I now see that some players, playing black ops, shoot their guns without ammunition, even though it's says 0/0 bullets, no ammo in red in the middle of the screen, and the characters constantly says their out of bullets. And there might be some map glitches here and there too, where you can escape some zombie dangers. But despite this, the zombie game is awesome and is one of my favorite games. So not to be confusing, the regular black ops isn't too fun for me, but the zombie mini-game is one of my favorite games of this decade.COD games are always overpriced and take longer to drop in price. You might as well get the newest version of COD you can instead. Keep in mind that it cost about $60 to get all the DLC for this game. But if you like zombies then you should get this one.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Zombies is the best thing about this overrated game", "unixReviewTime": 1325808000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2012"}

This is especially true about halfway through.Blackbird mission:This mission was pretty neat and could have been the coolest part of the game. However they seemed to rush it out and it felt very unfinished and of course very linear. It was actually the most linear of the game. I still put it as a pro b/c of the idea of it.I hope in the future more games look into this planned strategy and execute missions.Cons:Graphics:They were ok at best. I also want to mention, that graphics are not near as important to me as game play and I understand that there is a trade off. As far as the people that say the graphics and or sound are great, or it is a TV problem, I play on just over an 11 foot 1080p TV with an equally awesome sound setup. Looks great on games with great graphics. Looks average on games with average graphics. This looked average.AI:It was awful, awful, awful! This was true of both your team who would let people run right by them to shoot you and the enemy that would run right by 10 of your guys to shoot you. The AI is no different than AI of 10 years ago. It is absolutely unacceptable.Sound:All the guns sound the same, a grenade sounds like a little firecracker, and it doesn't matter if the sound is a half mile away, or right next to you, it all sounds the same. In a lot of games now, I can feel the concussion of the grenade b/c it hits my sub so hard.Gameplay:It was VERY linear and VERY mundane and monotonous.The mechanics were way too fast and movements were very jerky.I found myself frequently in missions just wanting to get to the end so they would be over. I ended up feeling that way about the game around halfway through.A grenade also has a kill radius half the time of about a foot or two.The \"Stealth\" mission:This game actually got some hype about the stealth mission which was absolutely AWFUL. I would even say it was the worst part of the game. It was strictly a timed mission in that you need to be at this point at this time or you were spotted. You could literally lie down in pitch black dark and then they would just start shooting at you from 50 yards away if your imaginary time ran out. You are also told to stay out of the light although you and your partner must run through it a couple times. To top it all off, the only way to pass it is to run under a bright spotlight and kill a guy.Cover system:Ever since Gears came out with the cover system, why can others not use it? This is especially true in games like this where you can crouch behind a boulder and bullets seem to curve around to get you. My only guess is that they would have to put a small amount of thought into their AI for this, and since they didn't do it anywhere else, they didn't want more work to not do.Fit and Finish:I had to RESTART 3 levels b/c it glitched on me. One example was when you search the crate at the plane crash. I stood by the crate and everyone else just stood about 20 feet back and stared at me. I sat there trying to figure out what I did numerous times and restarting at the checkpoint with no luck. After restarting the level, I went to the crate and my team followed and inspected immediately and everything worked fine.I just rented this game and had no desire to even try multiplayer. I took it back early and don't regret it one bit. I recommend others do the same.

This seems to result in a lot more in-match weapon variety.-Rocket launchers no longer fire projectiles in a laser-beam straight line, which eliminates a lot of \"noobish\" behavior online.-From a production standpoint, they capture the atmosphere of the Cold War very well...older gamers will get a kick out of it-So far, the single player storyline is pretty cool. The inclusion and references to real life historical figures is great.-Some new toys to play with unlike anything from the prior CoD games. Plus, flamethrowers make their triumphant return.-We now have a replay mode to playback matches, which is a nice touch.-The online map voting system is FINALLY up to snuff. Players actively vote FOR maps, from multiple options (including a \"random\" option), and not simply AGAINST playing a single map. If just one player has an opinion, his/her opinion is the one that counts. Small detail, but HUGE improvement.Cons:-Graphics haven't really progressed at all...in fact sometimes they seem to have regressed very slightly in some areas, at least in multiplayer. This may have been a price the developers had to pay to get the additional effects in (see pros). You won't notice it for long though.-Sounds aren't as punchy as they were in Modern Warfare 2.-I wish that multiplayer forced era-based weapon sets. It feels weird to be fighting in a mid-Cold War battle in an Asian jungle with a laser scope that has no right to be there.-I also wish that spy planes (i.e. UAVs in the last game) and the explosive RC cars were harder to obtainAll in all, if you like Call of Duty, absolutely pick this up. The selection of mid-Cold War era weapons (e.g. the original M-16) is a refreshing change from all the WW2 and modern combat games.

This game was by far my most anticipated game ever.  I had very high expectations for this game.  I will tell you that Treyarch met every single one of them and surpassed them all. First off i was insane about this game coming out and when i got it i went even more insane.  I told myself that i was going to beat the story mode before i played multiplayer.  I started playing the story mode the day i got it and ended up beating it the same day.  The story took me roughly 5 to 5 and 1/2 hrs to finish.  I never thought that the story mode would keep me so interested and enthralled.  This is by far the best story mode in any call of duty game.  The graphics are great, gameplay is smooth, achievements are fun, the voice acting is phenominal, Sam worthington did a great job.  I have no complaints about the story mode.  Now, .... to the best part, the multiplayer.  ABSOLUTELY THE BEST MULTIPLAYER EVER!  First off let me say that this game has a completely different feel then MW2.  It is also 10 times better then MW2.  They fixed all the stuff that made MW2 suck.  On top of that they added massive customization, and many ways to look at your stats and info.  I could write a book on Black Ops!  If you were the type of player to camp in a house and use one man army perk and keep shooting noob tubes at everyone, you are going to have a tough time playing black ops.  I'll give you some reasons why you will have a tough time: 1) killstreak kills dont count towards your next killstreak, 2) no one man army perk, 3)scavenger perk doesn't refill noob tubes or claymores, 4)noob tubes are not as strong, 5) no danger close perk, 6) IF YOU CAMP I WILL FIND YOU ;).

They are alot better than infinity ward, because i truly believe that they care about what type of game they're making and don't just care about the money.

{"reviewerID": "A2SEYD5DRDM9AU", "asin": "B003JVKHEQ", "reviewerName": "D. Coffee", "helpful": [7, 10], "reviewText": "As with other video games I have reviewed, the following will be subdivided into categories based on the components of gameplay for Call of Duty: Black Ops. As a disclaimer, this is the first Treyarch Call of Duty I have purchased, and my previous CoD experience has been with Infinity Ward's CoD4 and Modern Warfare 2.Single-Player Campaign:Pros:Story - The Single Player Campaign of Call of Duty Black Ops has a storyline that is, in my opinion, very well written. I will do my best to avoid spoilers, but suffice to say that there is definitely a binding motif to the story that keeps the player mindful of the fact that they are progressing through a series of linked events, not simply some random missions thrown together. The story has a definite beginning and end, and is itself quite intriguing. It combines elements of mystery, excitement, and history that keep the player guessing and involved. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the story is helped in no small part by excellent voice acting from an all-star cast including Ed Harris, Ice Cube, Sam Worthington, and Gary Oldman.Missions - The missions in the single player campaign are diverse and, in most cases, quite exciting. I never at any point in playing the campaign (which at this point I have completed on Hardened difficulty and am just starting on Veteran) felt like I was repeating the same mission with a different weapon or in a different environment. The variety of environments and special features in missions, such as the occasional vehicle piloting/driving, keeps the missions engaging and mixes up the usual CoD mode of \"shoot everything until you get to the waypoint\".Replay Value - I found a number of the missions in Call of Duty: Black Ops to be extremely fun, and combined with what seem from their description to be some pretty challenging Xbox Achievements, I definitely will be playing the campaign several more times.Challenge - The challenge of the game was about on par with what I have experienced in CoD4 and Modern Warfare 2. As previously mentioned, I have only completed the campaign on hardened so far, but there were several parts even on that where reckless play or inattentiveness would definitely get you killed. I think the challenge level is reasonable - not too easy, not too hard.Cons:Allied AI - As has been mentioned in other reviews, I have found the AI of your allies to be somewhat frustrating at several points of some missions simply for their inability to actually kill enemies coming up behind you and shooting you in the back. Although this was only a problem for me about half a dozen times over the entire campaign, which was about on par with that of Modern Warfare 2 in length and slightly shorter than that of Halo: Reach, those few times produced more than several deaths at each location.Overall Single-Player Campaign Ratings:Story: 5 starsGameplay: 3.5 starsChallenge: 4.5 starsReplay Value: 4 starsOverall: 4.25Online Versus Multiplayer:Pros:Gameplay - The gameplay of online multiplayer for CoD: Black Ops is pretty darn fun. I was an avid player of CoD: Modern Warfare 2 online and Black Ops is somewhat better overall, in my opinion. The new leveling system for how players acquire weapons, attachments, perks, and so on involves a money-earning system that allows players to flesh out the options that make sense for their playstyle and bypass those that they are not interested in. For example, I almost always use assault rifles or submachine guns in multiplayer, and thus I have been able to purchase many of those with their attachments while ignoring the option of purchasing shotguns. The number of available weapons, perks, attachments, and killstreaks is about on par with that of Modern Warfare 2, which I thought was pretty well fleshed-out.Multiplayer Levels - There are a fairly large number of multiplayer maps in Black Ops, only a few of which I habitually find myself disliking. They cover a wide range of sizes and types of environments: day, night, snow, jungle, big, small, everything. There is definitely a map for everyone in this game. Some of my favorites are Firing Range, Cracked, and Grid, but that is just my personal tastes. I think overall the maps in Black Ops are a bit smaller on average than Modern Warfare 2 but perhaps just slightly larger than those in CoD4, to give you some idea.Gametypes - There are all the same classic gametypes in Black Ops as other Call of Duty titles, and even some new lobbies, such as the \"Classic\" gametypes that put players on an even playing field to start in some capacity, regardless of level.Replay Value - It's multiplayer. It never gets old. 'Nuff said.Cons:Gameplay - Some of the gameplay mechanics definitely need tweaking for Black Ops, in my opinion. In particular, the spawn system sometimes is very frustrating, either spawning players when an enemy is practically looking down their sight at them already or with an enemy claymore three feet away (it's happened to me personally). In addition, I've never been a fan of the insta-kill knife attack in Call of Duty multiplayer, preferring melee attacks to only insta-kill from behind as in Halo or requiring the player to pull out the knife weapon first as in CounterStrike; however, Black Ops has effectively given the multiplayer knife attack even more emphasis, as since the Commando perk from MW2 is gone Treyarch decided to basically give every player the knife range of having Commando. Additionally, the knife attack seems to have the area effect of a frag grenade, as many times killcams show players knifing others without even looking at them.Networking - There are currently consistent network problems with CoD: Black Ops on Xbox Live. It has taken me sometimes upwards of half-an-hour to successfully enter a game lobby with a party of 4 or more players, and occasionally the in-game connections are terrible with no host switch occurring. Hopefully this will improve in the future, though.Overall Online Versus Multiplayer Ratings:Gameplay: 3.5 starsLevels: 5 starsGametypes: 5 starsReplay Value: 5 starsNetworking: 2.5 starsOverall: 4.2 starsDead Ops Arcade (Zombies):Pros:Gameplay - Zombies is just plain fun. Everybody knows it. Whether you're playing solo, two-player split screen, or 4-player co-op over the internet, Zombie mode is both challenging and ridiculous at the same time. It's awesome.Cons: NoneOverall Dead Ops Arcade (Zombies) Ratings:Gameplay: 5 starsOverall: 5 starsTheater Mode:Pros:Presence - It's finally here! Since Halo 3 introduced its theater mode to online multiplayer shooters, I've been waiting for a CoD to do the same, and Black Ops has finally brought it. The ability to shoot and save clips of multiplayer games, share files, including game variants, and preserve those awesome or ridiculous moments from your greatest times online is invaluable.Cons: NoneOverall Theater Mode Ratings:Overall: 5 starsOverall Call of Duty: Black Ops Ratings:Single-Player Campaign: 4.25 starsOnline Versus Multiplayer: 4.2 starsDead Ops Arcade (Zombies): 5 starsTheater mode: 5 starsOverall Game Rating: 4.6 starsWould I recommend this game to a friend: YES", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Call of Duty: Black Ops - Comprehensive Review", "unixReviewTime": 1289779200, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2010"}

Killing endless waves of zombies with your buddies cant be beat. Im glad they brought this back. A few things I can gripe about are the endless waves of soldiers on certain levels. Usually, the game allows you to proceed through the level after killing X amount of soldiers, well not this time. You need to be quick on the trigger to clear a path and run through hoping you dont get pelted with enemy fire along the way, with little to no help from your AI companions.

Black Ops' Multiplayer is a lot of fun, no doubt, but it pales in comparison to that of Battlefield BC2. It's almost like the Black Ops' multiplayer is dumbed-down to some degree. It kind of reminds me of the old Shooters for PC back in the day but with fewer players (i.e. Soldier of Fortune). In the end, the Bad Company 2 Multiplayer is so much more evolved in just about every way. If you are fan of War FPS games, you should absolutely have both of these games in your collection, but just know that the Multiplayer, while really fun, just isn't totally up to par (and if you have both games, you'll be going back to BF BC2 in the long run for your multiplayer fix :)EDIT - I traded this game after having it for a month. After beating the campaign and playing Zombies a few times, I didn't see myself playing it at all in the future. Black Ops is the first game I have ever traded (maybe the only one?), so that says something. I guess this would be a good game to pick up used or as a rental.

For this reason alone, I had a hard time enjoying the game.  I actually had more fun hunkering down and picking off perpetually-respawning enemies than I did advancing through my objectives.Another big drawback is that the game seems to focus too much on the movie-like storyline than on the gaming action itself.  The cut scenes are incessant.  Not just between missions, but during missions, too.  Sometimes you cannot skip them, so there were times I'd find myself in the middle of the action, then an unskippable cut scene would come up out of nowhere, and I'd have nothing better to do except go into the kitchen and make a sandwich.

I recently just realized that I have played this game for all 3 systems, the Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii. I'd have to say the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions are really no different from another. However the Wii was an improvement for Nintendo but still kind of dissappointing one; especially with graphics and exclusions. But I'd have to say, Call of Duty: Black Ops for the Xbox 360 be given a 9.5% same with thePlaystation 3 version. I'm impressed by the way Treyarch modified the Zombie mode, and now you can play as presidents, John F. Kennedy and Fidel Castro mostly caught people's attention. The Wager Matches were a big hit. Choosing different camos, outfits and weapon custumizations were new addition. You even dive in this game. The campaign and storyline were finely done. Although it could do without the interrogation and government-file clips, but at least it was something new as opposed to the previous Call of Duty titles where they simply pinpoint a location through satellite images and then you do the mission while listening to a narrator. I also like how Sargeant Viktor Reznov and Dimitri Patrenko from World at War makes appearances on Black Ops; certainly suggesting Black Ops to be a sequal and counterpart to World at War. Black Ops had indeed pulled itself away from the gimmicks and styles of other COD titles. Buying things is better than unlocking perks and weapons you don't want  The RC Cars are one of my most favorite kill streak rewards. Customizing kill streak rewards was also another leap that made  Black Ops king of the first-person shooters. Speaking graphicwise. The Xbox 360 and PS3 graphics, are really no different from each other. Those \"comparisons\" you see on YouTube between PS3 and Xbox 360 gameplays are made to make the PS3 look bad. People just adjust the brightness and contrast then claim that the Xbox 360 has better color...better texture or whatever. The online play is indeed addicting.

The following may sound nit picky but after playing Modern Warfare 2, you'll understand. Details in the sound, graphics, and animation are not at the same level of CODMW2. So while playing you'll feel like your playing a demo or an unfinished version.For example, while playing MW2 you can see individual grass blades, textures on Rangers sweaters, texture on walls ... a LOT of detail. In Black Ops, its just not up to that level. Another example of lack of attention to details, is when you level up in MW2 you get the sound and graphics that you've leveled up and you get an instant rush. In BO, it's very dry your just notified like it's a bland text message or something.I regret buying it at full price because I know I won't be playing this game past story mode.

Death from Above and the Ghilli sniper mission easily stand out as the most memorable gaming event for me ever. Easily that game is a 9.5/10 ( or dare I say even a 10/10 ).CoD4:MW2 was excellent but more of the same and I'd say that is a 8.5/10. CoD:WaW is perhaps an 8/10.That brings us to CoD:Black Ops. I had really high expectations from this game. However, after playing this game, its really more of the same with even louder and continuous explosions and high octane stuff thrown in. Its like a Michael Bay movie every minute with lots of explosions, bullets whizzing by and general mayhem and chaos all around you with annoying screen shakes and annoying chaos. The graphics are average ( no where near MW or MW2 quality ), audio is too loud and annoying at times although bullet sounds are great. The gameplay at its core is still the same with auto lock-on and generally quite good. However, the FEEL of the game isn't as powerful or as drawing you in as MW. The story is really the best part of the game. Voice acting is also quite good.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase ( I got it for $20 cheaper through Amazon's excellent promotion ) because for a $40 game its quite good. But for a $60 game its not. This game will sell however. It'll easily cross $500 million by year end or perhaps even hit a billion. Who knows. But Activision is sure milking it - charging $60 for even the PC version (capitalism at its worst) and will probably soon offer like 3 older maps and 2 new ones for like $20 and people will still buy it. It'll make money and leave a mark in gaming history for sure, but the true people behind it - Infinity Ward who rejuvenated the flagging CoD franchise will start to get forgotten. And perhaps in a year or two, this game will go the Madden way where it'll sell but won't remain as good with like 3-4 hour single player campaigns with still premium pricing.I will rate this an 8/10  ( average and good but not excellent ).

{"reviewerID": "A21RA62UCW5RL2", "asin": "B003JVKHEQ", "reviewerName": "F. B", "helpful": [2, 4], "reviewText": "Wow, there seem to be an abnormal amount of haters for this game.  Call of Duty Black Ops (BO) is a good game, I am not sure why people are rating it so low.  After reading many of these reviews, it seems that people have no idea how to logically rate a game, in fact, I would be so bold to say that regardless of the reasons given, it boils down to the fact that many people don't like this simply because it's different and more balanced then MW2.  I personally feel that most of the changes made in BO are for the better.The single player campaign is told in a more cohesive way and the story is pretty good, it doesn't have many of the \"wow moments\" that MW2 had, but it's still exciting nonetheless and has more of an emotional impact when it comes to your NPC team members.  It's about the length you would expect (5-7 hours) and there is an unlockable zombie mode upon completion.The meat of many COD games is the multiplayer and this is something BO excels at.  Not only do you earn experience points but you also earn COD points which is a form of currency the game utilizes (think Counter Strike).  This allows you to unlock what you want when you want it, it should be noted that some weapons are still only unlocked at certain experience levels, but you still have to buy them with your currency to use them.  It works well, although, I prefer the old system better of just unlocking new weapons as you level up as I find that the currency system lacks the addiction found in MW2 systems.  It's still fun and it leads to the biggest changes of the game which come in the form of `wager matches'.  Not only can you use that currency to buy weapons, sites, camo, killstreaks, etc..., but you can also use it as a down payment to enter a wager match hoping to come out of the match with more money then you had going in.  It's a fun system and something that works well later on in the game when you have currency to spare.  It certainly makes for some tense games when you have money on the line.So far most of the maps are great.  A lot of them have moving parts (train going by, missle launching, etc...) which is a nice touch and adds to the atmosphere.  The layout of all the maps seems to be stellar so far which is surprising because they did not have an open beta test period.  All enemies that I have come across hiding out in a room are vulnerable from some stand point, and no spot on any map really feels \"safe\".  I haven't really noticed an spawning issues like others have noted, although, on small maps such as Nuke Town, spawning close to the enemy probably can't be avoided from a code/design stand point.But the thing I enjoy most about BO's multiplayer are the small improvements.  Thankfully, the game ending killstreak - calling in a nuke, is gone.  The highest level killstreak you can get is 11, which is actually hard this time around because you can't spawn killstreaks like in MW2, so if you get killstreak 6 and call in a mortar strike and kill 3 enemies, you're killstreak is still 6, not 9, meaning you have to kill 3 more players with your gun to reach killstreak 9.  This is great because it makes it a lot harder to get killstreaks but more importanlty it helps prevent players from camping trying to spawn killstreaks, anything that prevents camping is a good thing.On the camping note, BO is not friendly to snipers, which is another awesome feature, I haven't played a map yet where it wasn't easy to spot snipers and take them out easily.  BO leans more towards a traditional run and gun type of play style which I personally prefer.Statistics!  Stats, and more stats, anything you want to know about how you play is located in the stat section of the muliplayer menu, how shots fired, deaths, kills, captures, etc... and much much more.  Also, at the end of matches you are shown more stats, not just kill/death info.  For example, at the end of a headquarters match you'll see your stats for; kills, deaths, kill/deat ratio, captures, and destroys.  This is a nice feature because it actually shows who on your team is actually trying for the objective,not just running around shooting people.Now the player has 3 spots in there inventory for items so you can have a frag, flashbang, and a claymore if you want.  There is new equipment you can carry now, a sensor which acts like a many personal UAV which you put in the ground and it displays movement near you, an UAV jammer which acts in a similar fashion, a camera that you can set up which replaces your radar with the camera feed.  There are also new special grenades to mess with such as the nova 6 grenade which emits a toxic gas cloud and a decoy grenade which emits gunfire and shows up on the enemy's radar as such implying that a real player is there which is great for causing confusion.Some of the perks have been rearranged too, stopping power has been taken out completely, although you really won't notice because you still die with only a couple of bullets.You can now dive to prone after sprinting which is just cool.Zombies, zombies, zombies, there is one level available to you from the start and you unlock the other one after completing the game.  I'm new to the whole COD zombie scene since this is the first game I've tried form Treyarch, but I find it to be a lot of fun.  It increases in difficulty quickly and you really have to work as a team if you want to make it far which is something that COD players have a hard time understanding and fail at so that adds to the difficulty.  I've made it further by myself then on a team of four!!!  The game style is a lot of fun, although it could be better if they added a simplified leveling system, I just don't feel like I get a lot out of it, some kind of permanent reward system (unlock special camo in multiplayer, or other guns you can use in zombie mode, etc...) would be nice.The graphics are good, they're actually a bit different then MW2 but still good.The game isn't with out it's faults though, but most of them are inherit to the franchise, not just this game.  Lag is still an issue, things like watching the killcam and seeing that you didn't fire at the enemy although you actually fired your gun twice, other players moving in segments, or watching the killcam and the enemy seems to be moving lightning fast, or the players who just drop to prone immediately but when you try it seems to take forever, etc...Also, they introduced a new game type called 'combat training' which is a great idea except it's executed horribly.  You can play by yourself against AI controlled opponents in team deathmatch or free-for-all, up to 10-11 bots I think???, this is great for new players to the franchise, or just for practicing out new techniques.  You level up just as you would in a real multiplayer match (points do not cross over) and it feels surprisingly similar to a real online match.  What doesn't make sense is that they require you to be online to play it???  Whaaaaaaaa, you make a game type specifically made to play offline and you require the player to be hooked up to the internet?  It doesn't make any sense.  I think it's mainly for tracking purposes (company feedback) so they can actually see how many people are playing combat training, but it's an odd design decision.This gameplay style will probably always be around, but it definitely is starting to feel like it needs a major refresher, game changing concepts need to start being introduced to this franchise.That being said, this is a Call of Duty game through and through, don't expect \"team play\" even if you're on a team, COD is all about lone wolf gameplay, although this is the most balanced COD game to date.  This is a great addition to the franchise and there is no reason you shouldn't pick this game up.Headquarters, here I come....***UPDATE (11/24/10)***Well, I have prestiged once now and have definitely had my fair share of multiplayer combat, both traditional and zombie mode.Here are some additional notes you might find important.  There has been an update which seems to have fixed most of the spawning issues found in the game (although I never really came across many), the downside is, now you spawn on the other side of the map to where the action is so it takes a bit longer to get back into things, which is a little annoying because COD games are all about quick kills, quick deaths scenarios, so starting closer to the action is more beneficial then starting far away.Zombie mode, is a lot of fun!  I\"ve made it to level 18 now and it's a good time.  The one major annoyance I have with zombie mode has nothing to do with that actual game play itself but the pre-game lobby that comes with it and how the server handles the host.  Unlike the standard multiplayer lobby where a countdown timer begins when the server has found enough players (requiring no input from players) and if the host leaves the game during the match the server switches to a new host allowing the game to continue, which is a great system, one that zombie mode doesn't use.For some reason, they've done away with that idea with the online zombie mode which requires 3 of the 4 players to be \"ready\", which is annoying because when you have a system that requires the player to input something before a game starts only half of them do, therefore the game never starts!  The game 'FarCry 2's multiplayer did the same thing for it's main online matches and you had the same thing happen, you would be waiting in the lobby for minutes, not seconds, sometimes 5 minutes, which is just dumb.  It ruined the multiplayer for that game.  So the fact that the zombie mode utilizes this system is baffling.  Once 4 players have been found the match should just start, the players shouldn't have to press the A button to say that they're \"ready\", it's implied that they're ready by them being in the lobby waiting for the next match!  Why they didn't take the main multiplayer match making system and utilize it in zombie mode is beyond me.Regarding the host issue, if you're playing zombie mode and the a player leaves the match who happens to be the host, the match just ends, doesn't matter if your at level 1 or level 20, the match is over.  No host migration and the game doesn't repopulate the player slot either (if a player leaves who is not the host), which again is a odd design decision and extremely annoying especially if you're far into a zombie match.Hopefully in the future Treyarch will update the zombie mode with unlockables of it's own, which would encourage more players to get into I think as well as reward players who play it well.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An extensive review for Call of Duty Black Ops (focused on Multiplayer)", "unixReviewTime": 1290211200, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2010"}

After hearing numerous previews, and getting a good pre-order deal, I went for it.  This is not a perfect game, but it really is a lot of fun, and that's what I buy games for.I know most reviewers like to measure framerates, graphic comparisons, etc...I'm not big on that level of tech talk, but I can tell you the game looks and plays great.  I played through it once, and spent a lot of time online, and it has never frozen or even stuttered.  I didn't play the last two COD games, so I don't know how evolved it is from the last one, but as a game on it's own merit, it is a very good game.  There is a storyline that runs through all the missions...basically, the missions reflect some top secret missions occurring during the cold war era, in places such as Cuba and Vietnam.  Not revealing too much, the general plotline borrows a bit from the Assassin's Creed series; an unknown group is going through your memories from mission to mission, trying to get to certain information.  Some of the missions get a bit frustrating, but not deal-breakingly so.  There are a couple of levels where your next goal wasn't as obvious as it could have been, and this can be frustrating, but this doesn't make for a bad game, it just takes it from being a great game to being a very good game.  The controls are very smooth, and very easy to pick up.  There are a great deal of different weapons that you will use, which does a lot towards keeping the gameplay fresh.Though I haven't played the last couple of COD games, even I know that the multiplayer experience is really the focus of the COD franchise.  I'm not a fantastic FPS player, but I have spent a long time on that mode, and have really enjoyed it.  There are several different modes of play; you start with team mode, a mercenary team mode (players are randomly assigned teams) and a free-for-all mode.  Playing more and more of the game unlocks other modes, weapons, maps and contracts.  Contracts are basically goals within the game...beat a certain number of people using a certain weapon, for example...which you purchase using COD money earned by playing the game.  Meeting the goal wins you a certain amount of money from the contract; missing it obviously costs you whatever you spent on the contract.  There are wager matches, where you bet on the results of matches. There are special modes like One In The Chamber, where you start with a gun with a single bullet.  If you kill one of the other players, you get their bullets.  Otherwise, you must rely on melee weapons.  The progression of multiplayer really encourages you to play more and more, to unlock all the modes, weapons and other bonuses available.  This is really what brought me to get this game, the variety of gameplay available in multiplayer is huge, and will likely be about the only online FPS I will be playing for quite some time.  I am really not very good, but the matchmaking and gameplay variety have made it a real blast to play.  There is also a training mode for those of us who haven't done a lot of multiplayer games, or just want to familiarize themselves with the game before heading online.  I think this is a great addition to the game; hardcore players may never venture into it, but to others of us, it's a great training ground.Maybe my favorite mode is the Zombie mode.  Basically, you are locked away in a certain area, and must figure out how to accomplish some goals then get yourself out of there.  Zombies are coming at you with gradually increasing vigor, and you must deal with them.  Every time you kill one, you get a certain amount of points.  Points are not just a part of your score, they are used as currency.  It's up to you to decide if you want to spend your points on new weapons, upgraded ammo, or using them to open up a new area.  Do you hang out in a certain room, picking off zombies and running up your score?  If you do, you will hit the harder areas, with tougher, faster, deadlier zombies, so be careful how you spend them.  Make sure you finish the main single player mode at least once to open up a hilarious zombie level!This game has come with a ton of hype, and has already become one of the best-selling games of all time.

It has so much fun and crazy stuff in it but unfortunately infinityward did not listen to us and the game fell down badly for multiplayer. MW2 (modern warfare 2) is very fun but has alot of multiplayer issues to it. Lucky, treyarch managed to listen to what we wanted and boy did they do a damn good job at it. While It has only been a day since it came out, the multiplayer is very well balanced. All of the guns, killstreaks and perks and very balanced.The killstreaks don't stack upon each other like modern warfare 2 and it really decreases the annoying killstreaks every 5 minutes like from modern warfare 2. They are not overpowered at all and very fair. You won't be frustrated very much at all from dying by killstreaks other then the RC-XD car which is very good. It keeps you focused more on your gun and your skills. The perks are much better, scavenger which is from mw2 that let you resupply ammo and noobtubes and claymores has been fixed in black ops. Scavenger will only pick you ammo for your primary gun, and equipment like grenade, flash. It does not refill claymores and grenade launchers which was a huge problem in modern warfare 2.There are not more quick scoping in black ops which was a huge turn on for me. I could not stand be quick scope by the intervention but that has been eliminated in black ops thank god.Zombies are back and they are just as fun as ever, there are 2 maps available for everyone and if you get the hardened or prestige edition, you get 4 additional maps from call of duty world at war.Perks are very well done and balances everything out. There are no stopping power and no juggernaut or painkiller.The maps are so much better then mw2 maps. There are not alot of sharp corners like in mw2 where you go around the corner and die. The maps are really good.Overall, the multiplayer for call of duty black ops really balances and fixes everything out from mw2. If you loved mw2, then you will love black ops.If you love mw2 but really annoyed by stupid deaths, then this game will fix your issues. I say this is what mw2 should have been.UPDATE:Okay, so it has been out for a while and so far there are no problems with the game. However, I will say it got repetative really quick. When I played MW2 I didn't get bored of it at all. But this game feels a bit too familiar to MW2. Graphics are obviously a step down but it is better overall for the balance. This game is great but too much of the same, also it does not really fel like their in vietnam, it is too modern. Black Ops and MW2 but have ups and downs.Black Ops-Pros:Better Campaign, better Co-op, better balanced multiplayerCons:graphics downgraded, boring after a while, seen it all in MW2MW2-Pros:Better graphics, more high paced action, not as repetative unless you are geting frustratedCons:poor single player, poor Co-op, unbalanced multiplayerAll in all, Black Ops is a better deal in terms of balance and co-op, single player", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "What Modern Warfare 2 should have been.....Call of duty Black Ops Better version", "unixReviewTime": 1289347200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2010"}

It has broken almost every sales record for first day sales. Unfortunately, the game fails to deliver in many respects.In the single player mode, the plot makes almost zero sense until the last 2 missions. The menu interface (tied into the campaign story) is rather unique and quasi-interactive (there are a few achievements related to this menu system). Unfortunately, many of the weapons used in the game were not developed/used during the years in which the plot takes place. The SPAS-12 and Steyr AUG were not used in the Vietnam era.The game also uses the term \"ACOG\" in a generic manner to describe a variety of magnified optics. Generally speaking, the ACOG is a Trijicon product to describe its family of Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights. In this game, an ACOG could be a Russian POSP or the built-in optic for the AUG and Enfield L85.Some feel the multiplayer mode is the real gem of the Call of Duty series. Black Ops adds a Combat Training mode where you can play against Bots (Unreal Tournament, anyone) and earn currency for mods so you can try all the equipment/gear before you commit in the normal multiplayer mode. I felt it is more of the same. Once you've played a Call of Duty multiplayer game, you've played them all. The veteran players were already at level 20+ within a few hours of the game being released. I was still trying to get used to the horrible controller interface versus the more effective mouse/keyboard solution for FPS games.The zombie mode is kind of interesting, although you just encounter endless waves of Zombies with up to 3 other players online. Left 4 Dead is much better for zombies.The graphics aren't anything to write home about, and the audio is kind of sub-par compared to Medal of Honor and CoD MW2. I use Turtle Beach X41 Digital Dolby 7.1 surround headphones, and the positional audio in Black Ops is terrible.Overall, the game is moderately enjoyable in the campaign mode and the multiplayer mode is more of the same. It's best to play with friends, otherwise it feels like any other multiplayer gaming experience with random strangers. However, Black Ops was certainly not worth the release date pricing, although Modern Warfare 2 has not dropped much in price even a year after its release.I give it 3/5 stars.

This is a phrase I've never used before, but...I don't think children should be playing this game.Please don't interpret this as any right-wing nonsense or ESRB loving BS. When games like Grand Theft Auto and Doom (Doom?  Freaking Doom caused school shootings?  Are you high?) are lambasted for violence and blamed for everything the past two generations have done wrong, I laugh and boot up Gears of War for a while to practice my chainsaw gun skills.  But that's the thing with most of those other games; they exist snuggly in some absurd video game fantasy world.  A chainsaw?  On a machine gun?  Come on now.  We aren't learning a disrespect for life or... anything really.  In fact, I don't think we're learning anything at all, save for hand-eye coordination and basic story telling devices.  The idea that violating pixelated monsters and even human analogs is what's warping my fragile little mind is absurd.  And yet...Here I am, playing Black Ops (Or Modern Warfare, same basic deal), looking down my sites and firing in controlled burst at muzzle flash in the distance that I can only assume is the bad guy and I've got this strange feeling in my gut.  I don't know how to describe it, but it's a little nauseous (just a little) and a little uneasy (just a touch) and it's exactly how I felt while watching Saving Private Ryan (for the first and only time).  I'm engaged, I'm fascinated, I can't look away, but I'm not having 'fun'.  No, what I'm feeling now, I can describe it a lot of ways, a lot of positive ways even, but certainly not as 'fun'.I've never been to war, I've never even played paint-ball.  But there's a part of me that just knows for a fact they've nailed some real-world physics when making this game.  The battle cry of the gaming pacifists has always been that they desensitize us to violence when really all they (usually) do is desensitize us to FANTASY violence or the IDEA of violence, and those are very very very different things from ACTUAL violence.  If anything, I'd say we as Americans are among the biggest sissies on the planet when it comes to ACTUAL violence (think about what goes into a bull-fight or political riot or a freaking public beheading next time you hear someone complain about a damn football game).  But these modern war games are a step (admitted a very small one but the first I've seen since COPS first aired) of injecting real-world, honest-to-goodness, palatable murder into mainstream culture.  Am I saying they're responsible for school shootings and gang wars (do those still happen, or was that a '90's thing?)?  No, of course not.  What I'm saying is...I've no idea what I'm saying.  Maybe parents (especially those with young boys with anger issues) should take the extra step before buying their kids this game and play it themselves?  Maybe... maybe we should just acknowledge the steps we're taking in our entertainment, the level or realism we're demanding and how we've begun to strip away fantasy whilst still labeling as entertainment.  Maybe acknowledging that will be enough?  Maybe none of it will matter in fifteen years when the next bloody spectacle comes  out?  Maybe my guts are just too delicate?But, of course, the reviews are correct and this game is damn near flawless.  Tight visuals and sounds, compelling level design, serviceable story, voice acting that ranges from great (GARY OLDMAN!!!) to ugh-that-guy-from-Terminator-Salvation-again.

It feels more like an old Medal of Honor game than a Call of Duty.  The story line is fine and interesting, but it just doesn't work for a Call of Duty game.  What made Call of Duty great and what separated it from Medal of Honor was the fact that it was a no nonsense war based shooter that featured pure combat from beginning to end.  There wasn't any of the bull you got with MOH that featured a bunch of sneaking around and secret missions and other boring stuff you had to wade through to get to the combat.  Now, with Black Ops, it seems COD is aspiring to be MOH and that's a mistake.  In fact, the combat in this game feels a lot like the combat in MOH Airborne.  It feels claustrophobic and extremely tracky, the guns don't seem accurate or feel real powerful.  The enemy doesn't seem real or smart, more like ducks in a shooting gallery.  Once more, for all their considerable gab, the main characters don't seem real either.  The graphics are weak for the most part and the whole thing just has a cheap 2D feel to it, perhaps summed up best by the scene at the end of the last mission where half the ships in the US fleet are jammed into the screen, all sitting about a foot apart.  I felt boxed in and rushed all the time I was playing the campaign mode.  The Zombies part of it was fun and funny for a little while, but it's a game that you can't win, that has no end, so what's the point?

Sam Worthington's voice acting as Mason sometimes betrays his Australian accent. Also, the game tends to lose momentum whenever we get to the interrogation scenes. Also, there's an underwater mission towards the end which seems really tacked-on. We're told that there are 15 minutes left to complete the task, yet in real life it would take at least that long to get the equipment and suit up, especially given that scuba gear wasn't supposed to be a part of the original plan. Then there's the final scene, which takes MW2's over-the-top 'America number 1' jingoism and runs with it. But I guess that's where this series wants to go these days.But in general, this game is a heck of a lot better than MW2.

Let me explain...This game is almost an exact carbon copy of MW2 (which I have played extensively).  The gameplay and strategies for success are identical (run to cover, ADS, shoot bad guys, rinse and repeat).  BO tries to hide this by adding short sections where you fly a chopper or drive a boat, but it is easy to see that the heart of the game is not innovative at all.  New guns and \"customizations\" don't count: they are topical and do not add to the fun of the game.I always like playing game campaigns if for no other reason than to experience the storyline (Halo Reach comes to mind).  BO campaign is boring and redundant, which would be fine except that the storyline isn't interesting at all and barely even makes sense. I played through it on easy just to expedite the otherwise painful process of uncovering the plot.Multiplayer is equally bland.  If your interest in MW2 multiplayer is waning, then don't expect to be entertained for long by this game's online capacities.  Other than the usual spawn and die COD multiplayer, they added wager matches where you can bet COD points.  Ok, except that wager matches are dumb games like crossbows and gun game (a rip-off from counter strike) that don't reflect in-game skill, so what's the point of being serious about them?  Multiplayer apparently goes up to prestige 15 now. Good luck getting there.  I wanted to gouge my eyes out after 20 levels of presige 0.Zombies mode seems to be a redeeming quality for some players, yet I feel that it is linear and boring; similar to Halo firefight.  Spawn, buy guns, shoot zombies, repair walls, open doors, repeat, repeat, repeat...Overall, the game is just plain boring and is an entirely forgettable entry in the history of FPS.

And that works both ways.  On the pro side, there's a lot of repeat game play value.  That's great because the game is fun when it works.  On the con side, you get people who dedicate large portions of their lives to the game.  It gets insane quickly.  There are some very legitimately GREAT players.  I've seen Youtube videos of people who just have a knack for running through maps killing everything.  There are cheaters who manipulate software exploits, hack their controllers, or even their network wiring for an in-game edge.  There are people who pay for cheating services.  Then there are the boosters who deliberately throw games for their friends in order to help them in their quest for rank, eventually gaining them some special skill or weapon they couldn't otherwise achieve.  Most lately, clans have really taken the game over.  Clan members spend a lot of time coordinating attacks.  One particularly lethal tactic is pining the opposite side down on spawn points.  They kill the other side as soon as players are drawn on the map.  There are other styles of cheating.  A lot of players dashboard, meaning they quit a losing game early in such a way that saves their win/lose statistic.  One annoying oversight of the game, besides encouraging this kind of thing, is putting a new player in the last few seconds of a losing game.I am not a good player.  I think my kill-to-death ratio is a little above 1, which is laughably bad to more dedicated players.  I'm okay with that.  I swear.  As soon as I join a Black Ops multiplayer game and get killed 10 times in a row within a second of spawning, I get irritated rather than competitive.  I'm not going to go join a clan of people I don't know to be \"the best around/nothing will ever get you down.\"  It seems silly.  A beer and a football game is more my style.  But it means I only play Black Ops when it's fun.  And unfortunately, that's an on-off relationship.A par system is the obvious fix here.  It seems trivial to me.  Spawn killing metrics seem easy.  As does pairing clan games.  (Why would any game pair six clan players against six strangers?)  And clamping down on some of the more annoying game aspects like dashboarding and picking up the tail end of a losing game seem really simple too.  All of this stuff seems very easy to fix.  There are thinning gaming profits, sure, and that's a concern.  But I think a par system to make this game universally enjoyable is pretty much the most critical next-step evolution in the series.

Now to what I think:Single Player:Easily the best CoD campaign ever.  This includes the steaming pile of fail that was the MW2 campaign.  The characters, locatations and set pieces are interestingly done and well excuted.  The graphics are outstanding in the campaign and the gunplay is smooth and intuitive. The voice acting is absolutely top notch and a strong point of the game.Bottom line is that if you are hating on this campaign, then you must absolutely despise the SP in MW, MW2, WaW, BFBC/2 and any other military FPS.  This campaign is unequivically better than each of those.  Not even close.Multiplayer:I've put in about 6 hours and haven't had serious technical issues.  There has been a few problems when trying to join a game in a group.  And there is some noticable lag, though not much from my end.As for the gameplay, it's what you'd expect.  This is a CoD game and developers didn't overhaul the mechanics or anything like that.  So if you expected this to feel like a \"new\" game, then you might be disappointed.There are some nice additions to the strategy component of leveling up your character.  Treyarch has implemented a currency system, which allows you to pick and choose what equipment/perks you want to buy.  You acquire cash based on your in-game performance.  You have to plan for the future when you acquire cash, and cannot just buy everything up (at least not at first). This is kind of a polorizing feature, but I like it overall.I think the level design is pretty solid too.  In my 6 hours of on-line play I haven't been noticing a crazy amount of camping.  While there are places to snipe, the levels are designed in a way that once you identify where the shots are coming from, there are plenty routes of ingress to go take out the would-be camper.Also, I think the weapons and gear are really well balanced.  When I'm playing I notice a great variety of weapons being used, which is a good sign, because that means everyone is not flocking to one uber powerful gun.Overall:This is honestly a great game.  Don't listen to the detractors who are going to whine simply because of how commercially successfully this game is going to be.  It's a wonderful package, with plenty of AAA content.

I felt like I could now become a CoD player, one that doesn't die more than 10 times a Deathmatch. I am then directed to push on my control pad to get extra points. Selfish with confidence I start to push the control pad while oblivious to the player behind me. The other player finds the perfect kill as he pounds me with bullets and I fall to the ground, the confidence washed away and the excuse of the player having a better gun than me falls into my mind.Call of Duty:Black Ops was the whole reason why I went to Best Buy and bought it the day it was released. I was extremely excited to play the long anticipated game but before playing it, I saw the overall review rating on Amazon and it didn't seem like one of my favorite series was doing well.  I didn't want to play Blacks Ops after that, mostly because I didn't want to be disappointed and I had a Kinect review that needed to be finished. After days of Black Ops being in my game shelf, I finally put it in my Xbox and pressed start.Black Ops starts out with \"Mason\" in a torture room, filled with old fashioned television sets, and a rectangular window with a silhouette of the man who is interrogating Mason. You heard the loud obnoxious voice of the interrogator asking you question after question, things that you as a player don't know about.After questions, Mason will start talking which leads to him remembering his past. Blacks Ops goes on like this till the end when Mason finally finds the truth. The whole storyline never made me look at the time. I was playing mission after mission enjoying the exciting game play that made me like Call of Duty in the first place. I would be driving a motorcycle while shooting enemies, I would be in a \"rat\" tunnel, ready to shoot the enemies in hiding. Black Ops campaign incorporates great experiences, levels, characters, and more.Black Ops online multiplayer is addicting with so many modes to play in or unlock, it will take me a while to get bored of it. Black Ops online multiplayer is just like the taste I got fromCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. But Blacks Ops online multiplayer with Xbox Live does have a few flaws. I get in to matches really fast in Black Ops but find it extremely annoying when I get into a match that has already started. The maps can be very limiting, to someone who playsHalo Reach. The game lobby can also be confusing at first, which makes for a frustrating time adding your controllers to the match.Zombies is my most favorite part of the whole Black Ops. You and 3 other players are placed in locations like the Pentagon or an old Theater. Your main goal is to survive the rounds of zombies. Zombies can also be played online, but makes for a frustration with getting a match, many times the game lobby closes or is \"migrating hosts\". This frustration with online play downs the experience.Black Ops is still another installment to the series but doesn't rave with me. Black Ops has great same game play, but doesn't seem to stand out in the Call of Duty series. Ops also has mediocre graphics that can't be symbolized as a \"stand out\".Call of Duty:Black Ops is one great game, it has adventure, great controls, and CoD experiences. But not all of that can hind the mediocre design and more. The game it's self is a must have for anyone who likes Call of Duty but it seem like a whole different game then what the hype was saying. At the end, Black Ops is not fantastic but it isn't a failure.Important UpdateI have had Black Ops since the release date and have been enjoying it, until my game play (missions, zombies) was lost. I don't know how this happened but after I put in Black Ops, it started like I haven't even played the game. After I placed the setting into the game, I checked my Campaign and all my progress (beating the game) was lost. I then just decide to forget about it and play Zombies, unfortunately my zombie progress was lost too. This has never happened to me with a video game before and all I can say is that I am a little disappointed.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Black Ops is not a stand out in the series but still is a great game", "unixReviewTime": 1291593600, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2010"}

While they haven't been consistantly good, Call of Duty 4 is still one of my favorite all time video games. Now comes the seventh entry in the series (after World at War and Modern Warfare 2). Call of Duty: Black Ops is a very exciting game that excells in story-telling but is weighed down by familiar gameplay mechanics.While the plot's of the Call of Duty games have never been all that impressive, filled with forgetable heroes and villians Black Ops has very well-written characters that bring a very personal feeling to the game's story. No it's not movie worthy (and I'm sure everyone guessed the final twists at the end) but the fact that I actually found myself engrossed in the events of the overall story and the fully voiced player-characters puts this one a notch above the previous Call of Duty games. The voice acting is also terrific with Sam Worthington, Ice Cube, Gary Oldman, and Ed Harris giving real weight to their characters. The music is also very exciting with some great period tracks setting the overall tone of the game.While the story-telling is rock-solid, the actual level designs and basic gameplay of Call of Duty: Black Ops are typical and not very engaging with the exception of a cool prison break level and  one where you're swimming around in Vietnam. Don't get me wrong, no other FPS has quite captured the excitement of the Prypiat, Ukraine missions of Call of Duty 4, but considering this game's called 'Black Ops' you sure do cause a LOT of explosions and get into a lot of gunfights. The basic gameplay is also exactly the same as it was in Call of Duty 4 and even with the 1960's time period the game feels a bit worn-out. Black Ops DOES manage to incorporate some vehicle mechanics into it's gameplay, but even these feel more like arcade shooting moments than actual engrossing experiences (that and they're WAAAAY too brief). The zombie mode is back from World at War and the White House mission is a lot of fun in a tongue-in-cheek manner, but is otherwise identical.When all's said and done Call of Duty Black Ops is more like the ODST to Modern Warfare's Halo 3 (better story, same old gameplay with lots of multiplayer options). It's not an evolution of FPS nor is it really a change to the Call of Duty series in general. Call of Duty Black Ops is a very good game and worth at least a rental (unless you're a multiplayer fan), but lets just hope the next COD takes things in a more unique direction.(a note: I know there's a lot more to Call of Duty Black Ops than the single player campaign and I'm sure you'll have no problem finding a review on here for the multiplayer options.

You could be in a foxhole shooting at an enemy, and enemies will continue to go to that exact spot over and over again.  It's simply pushing a button over and over again in the same spot (and there are points in the game where there will be a seemingly endless amount of stupid AI enemies coming to the same spots).  It simply gets boring.Multi-Player:  The first thing I noticed in multi-player was the level design.  There are no \"stand out\" levels that are especially fun. Do you remember the first time you played the \"Crash\" level on MW1? A great level design makes all the difference. The levels in Black Ops are mostly forgettable and don't have that attention to detail that you really look for in a COD title.

The players move differently, not as fluidly it seems to me as MW2, and the sound effects are off.  When you run, for example, the sound of your equipment clanking around doesn't sound very realistic and doesn't seem to be in sync with your movements, and then sometimes you'll be running and hear your footsteps, and then all of a sudden you're running in complete silence, yet the ground type hasn't changed.

Your support is not worth too much, most of the time they shoot at absolutly nothing.-Some temporary indestructible enemies.Biggst one I took notice on was in the vietnamese raid.  There was a vietnam soldier that ran right in front of me with an RPG and I could not kill him with anything I had (M60&AK47;) untill he set himself up and shot his RPG, then I shot him once and he was able to die.So untill certain enemies play their full roll, they will not die. Happens a lot throughout the campaignTHE MISSThe words I have can only express a little of how dissapointed I was when I wanted to shoot this disk till there was no existance of it left.After 1 year of modern warfare 2's relesase and having the best online multiplayer out of any FPS in existance and keeping me hooked to play it over and over again, THIS someone must have been smoking crack when they put BLACK OPS multiplayer together.Multiplayer looks like a cartoon(players-maps-weapons), very sluggish, and it takes forever to get conntected to matches.  MW2 I got conntected in no time.I dont mind going old school with anything from weapons to places to clothes, BUT THIS IS WRONG.Zombie Mode?If you want to go around and shoot zombies get wolfenstien, dead rising, resident evil, etc. instead.  In COD you rack up points and use those points to rebuild barriers to help keep zombies from breaking trough.  The zombies are tough too, but after you eventually get killed and see how many rounds of zombies you lasted through, you would start from scratch all over again.  No leveling up, unlocking weapons no nothing.  It goes nowhere.WARNINGIf you love MW2 Multiplayer, you will not like Black Ops multiplayer one bit.

COD 4, Modern Warfare 2, even the World At War game wasn't too bad. Not great but not crap either. I bought the new Medal of Honor after seeing the commercials and buying into all the hype and because I was getting a little tired of playing Modern Warfare 2 for almost a year straight. Turns out that overall I didn't care for Medal of Honor (for various reasons) but after playing it the positive points (better graphics and GREAT sound effects) made it hard to go back to playing MW2 again. So where did that leave me? I don't like the Halo games (just because of the theme being space/sci-fi based)so I couldn't get Halo:Reach. I didn't have high hopes for Black Ops because it was made by Treyarch and I haven't really LOVED their additions to the Call Of Duty Franchise. But now that I've played Black Ops for several hours (came in the mail yesterday November 9th, 2010) I can say that I really do like this game (call of duty: black ops) and don't have too many gripes about it. I have only played the multiplayer mode and look forward to playing it for at least a year until the next COD comes out.Some positive points of the game:1.I like the new upgrade system. If you aren't aware how it works I'll try to explain it. In the previous versions of COD you had to wait until you got to a certain level to unlock each upgrade for your weapons. Some of them that you probably didn't even want or ever use(like the shotgun attachment for your assault rifles). In Black Ops you can buy any of the attachments you want for your weapon (once you have access to the weapon that is) as long as you have the points/cash (call of duty points, which you earn during game play, not real money) for it. What's that? You don't want the ACOG for your Rocket Launcher (joke)? Then don't buy it. You don't need one attachment to get to the next attachment. Just so I am clear, you still need to get to certain levels (rank up) in order to have access to different weapons. It's just that now you don't have to rank up just to get all the attachments. You just need the cash :)2.There are lots of new weapons(and lots of familiar weapons from the other games), some new character skills, kill streaks and gadgets to play with that make this game fresh.Some things that could be better:1.Graphics. Medal of Honor (2010) definitely looks better than this game. That being said... I don't know if I would call the graphics on this game worse than Modern Warfare 2 or just different. I have no idea what the creator was aiming for when they made it. I don't have a big problem with the looks of the game. To me the game play makes up for it.2. Sound effects. Again, Medal of Honor DOMINATES this game and all the other war themed games I've played. The sound effects on Black Ops just don't stand out and make you take notice.3. Map size. So far the maps that I've played over several hours (not sure If I played them all or not) seem on the small side and some (nuke house I think it's called) are TINY. That doesn't mean they aren't fun. I would just like to see some really large maps.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Medal of honor sucked? Tired of Modern Warfare 2?

Mijal", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "I have beaten the Single Player Campaign and played days' worth of multiplayer Xbox live. I simply despise this game in its most basic fashion, everything from the feel to the visuals to the sounds. Now there were a few parts of the game that I enjoyed. However those were separated by such a wide time lapse that they hardly register.Single Player Campaign: I started out with what I thought might have been promise. Shoot Castro in the face, sounds like a good day for any freedom loving American; after though it takes a turn for horrorville. I played this game thinking at some point it's got to get better, but time and time again it only got worse to me. The characters were predictable, the big twist of the game was predictable, and worst of all your character's apparent issues aren't noticed by any of the other NPC's... really? If you have ever seen the Manchurian Candidate then you have played through Black Ops story line.Multiplayer: This is the spot of the game that murdered Call of Duty: Black Ops for me. Even if I didn't like the Campaign mode (I am huge single player video gamer) then the multiplayer can always make up for it. Example: Battlefield: Bad Company 2. Yet they dumbed down the entire experience of this game completely. If you have played Modern Warfare 2 take all of the things you hated to see in Multiplayer and make them easier to get away with in this game. You seemingly have to have zero skill to be good at killing people in this game. Examples are abundant.Lag: There is some intense lag built straight into the Xbox live game play. I have witnessed and recorded on numerous, numerous, and numerous times of my shots traveling straight through a man and causing no damage. (Now when you view your videos in the theater they are pulled off the server not what you viewed on your screen, which is a whole different issue.) Yet I will see an enemy shoot 6 feet to my rear and put me down. Now unless he can bead the space time continuum this is highly improbable. Now once in a while things I have no problem with but this is constant and consistent. You can almost predict infallibly when it is going to occur.Auto-Aim Trash: No Weapon in this game seems to have any kind of realistic recoil. Ok let me take that back, with auto-aim off they do but the online play defaults to auto-aim... really online play with automatic auto-aim. You must be kidding me right? Yet turn auto-aim on and it compensates for the recoil when you are aimed at somebody. So you don't even need skill to pull the trigger responsibly anymore. The only gun I saw with recoil was the M14 (in my opinion the only gun that requires skill to use proficiently.) Put that on top of the Auto-Aim's ability to drag your aim cross screen to rest on an enemy's chest without ever touching the joystick to move and you got a game that does not promote any real need for skill or talent.Additions: This is one part that I truly did like. There is a lot of content in COD: Black Ops that is new and fresh. New guns, optics, gun skins, face paint, Emblem creation, and all that stuff to customize your gun and player card. Yet the only add on I hated was the 1st perk character depiction. You use the Ghost Perk and get to run around with a ghillie suit? That sounds like a formula just begging people to camp in bushes (which there are plenty of) with a fully automatic assault rifle. Also apparently Cold War technology on surviving explosions was way more advanced than modern day. There is no way a point blank C4 explosion should be deflected with a Flak Jacket.Zombies: The only saving grace of this game for me. It is the only reason I ever throw this game into my 360. I play with friends in this all the time and sometimes all day. Yet as soon as I finish with Zombies they move onto MP I take the game out. I am convinced Jesus himself designed Zombies game type. It is excellent.Graphics: 5/10(Really they got worse from MW2? Treyarch how I despise you.)Music: 7/10(Decent music throughout the game. It didnt distract to much but never added that pure epic feel either.)Replayability: 1/10 (For me at least)(Beat it on Veteran the first time through like I do all COD's)Gameplay: 4/10 (Normal game) 10/10 (Zombies)(The controls seem to have been made for the zombie game, not a tactical shooter.)Closing Thoughts: I really don't like it when Treyarch makes COD's. I feel they just capitalize on the money market for COD. The last two COD's Treyarch has put out have been in my op, substandard. World At War was not good to me, because it offered nothing new from 2, or 3. On that subject COD 3... This was an epic waste of time that I wish I had never beaten.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Call of Doodie...", "unixReviewTime": 1309046400, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2011"}

But even there, continual multi-player lock ups and a slew of problems/bugs dampen the fun. If I had a dollar for every time the multi-player aspect locks up or kicks me out of the server usually after achieving some hard to achieve contract, I would own a serious stake in Treyarch. It's beyond frustrating, as is the release of a new set of maps for additional fees prior to fixing the fundamental flaws from release time. Other problems end up occurring in split-screen mode, where I play frequently. Weapons customization slots overlap across player, so if I name one slot Joe's CQB Setup in the first slot under my profile and then my significant other saves her layout in the same position slot and renames it, my custom setup name gets overwritten. Likewise, when I save customized slots, often the settings don't save, and I only realize once I'm in a match that the settings reset to a prior state. This also happens with the screen size (initial setup where you adjust the left/right and top/bottom stretch) and with the controller sensitivity, which randomly seems to reset itself to another setting between matches, so I'm continually having to jump into the options menu between deaths and reset the look-sensitivity. These are all minor nit picks that seem like they would be easy to fix, but when they occur they are so frustrating and mar and otherwise very enjoyable game.

Out of all of them, I have to say, Black Ops is my favorite.The graphics are head and shoulders above the earlier games. The gameplay is smooth, and the story is interesting.I LOVE the multiplayer in black ops! I've played a LOT of multiplayer in the FPS games I mentioned above, and I have to say, black ops feels the most fair and the least affected by latency that I've seen. That's not to say there's not an effect when you have a bad connection, just that it's not nearly as pronounced as in the other shooters.The UI does a good job of communicating appropriate information. It's easy to tell how much latency you have based on a cell-phone like display. There's some gravy like seeing both the count and a map with a lightmap showing where people are playing in the world - I saw more than a MILLION a few days ago! Fun statistics entertain you while scenarios load.There's a number of great maps for multiplayer, and each have strengths and weaknesses for different play strategies. You can pick from a variety of scenarios such as capture the flag, domination, demolition, and free-for-all and team deathmatch modes. Most of the maps are pretty well thought out, and I find myself still learning something new every now and then after several hundred hours of online play time.Obnoxious players are blessedly easy to mute at pretty much any point in the game.Weapons have a nice variety of categories, strenght within category, and attachments. Likewise, you can pick 'perks' which let you do things like run quickly, whip out a pistol for a little payback right before you die, aim more quickly after sprinting, and a plethora of other things. Finding exactly the right combination is a bit tricky, but that's half the fun! For me personally, I like the Aug rifle early on, the Commando rifle later, and the AK47u SMG as soon as you can get it.Pretty much everything in multiplayer rocks. Great game!Pro:- Great graphics- Good gameplay- Great variety of weapons and perks enabling different strategies from stealth to kamikazee- Good variety of maps, yet most are fairly balanced- Online play is excellent, with good latency compensation mechanics, and feels fair.Con:- None I can think of. I love this game!Favorite tips:- don't forget to check out the challenges for 'pro' mode for each of the perks, it really helps. The earlier you pay attention, the better.- SAM launcher kill-streak is one of the most useful!- claymore mines are a nice way to pick up an kills each spawn you manage to live for a little bit.- Favorite load-out for L20+: AK47u w/red dot, LAW or Strela rocket launcher; frag grenade, flash-bang grenade, claymore mine; Perks Ghost, Steady Aim, Last Chance. Kill streaks: Spy Plane, SAM turret, Care Package- Early in the game you get some nice pre-made configs. Don't forget to create your own as soon as you can!- pay attention to the kinds of players in each match. Some will run around willy-nilly. Sometimes you get a team where everyone camps. Adjust your play accordingly or suffer the consequences.

I refuse to play MW2 online anymore because of that.  Only downside to Black Ops is the spawning.  Sometimes you get a really bad spawn.  They patched it so it happens less, and thats good.  Now it seems to about the same with other games.  No matter what, sometimes you are just going to have an unlucky spawn.Multiplayer is crazy deep.  Contract, wager matches, challenges, new (and better imo) perks.  I love the way that you unlock guns and attachments.  I just wish that CoD points were easier to accumulate in early levels.And then there is Zombie mode.  Whats to say about zombies?  I love killing them.  Chances are YOU like killing them.

But, with more and new weapons, weapon upgradability, new zombie enemies, and teleporters (after all everything is better with portals) its a crazy good time for all involved.All in all, I would have to say that this is the finest CoD on current generation consoles (CoD3 doesnt count in that as it was on last gen as well).

This franchise is a yearly event now, surrounded by TONS of hoopla. This game was no different. Breaking sales records that CoD MW2 set last year. However, in my opinion, this game is not much better. I have played it since 1am the Tuesday it came out and my overall opinion is that while it does have some different elements and some worse elements, it also has better ones too. The single player campaign is equal to last years CoD. The graphics are just about on par and the story is exciting. Controls are the same as expected. The online multiplayer is very different in that you must unlock items and then \"buy\" them with CoD dollars that you earn by playing the multiplayer. There are also wager matches that is actually more fun than the standard play list of free for all, team deathmatch, etc. In wager matches, you put up a specified amount of CoD bucks and you play other types of games, such as \"one in the chamber\". A game where everyone starts with a knife and pistol with one bullet. If you kill someone, you get another bullet. If you use your bullet, you dont get another until you respawn after dying, or kill someone. There are a few other wager type matches also. As for the bad on the multiplayer, there are lag issues and connection issues. Sometimes it can take 5 min. to connect to a match. However as of 11/14/10, I have read that patches are going to be here very soon to fix these issues. Also, the graphics of multiplayer isn't nearly as nice and polished as MW2. That was a big disappointment to me. One HUGE problem that has been fixed since MW2 is boosters. No longer can you use tactical insertion in free for all. FINALLY!

It's obvious activision can make cuts since people are buying the brand and thats exactly what happened. The game runs slightly slower than MW2 making some of the knife kills hard and awkward to get. It's like a bad remake of soldier of fortune call of duty style. The guns have no actual recoil. The guns just shake around making the gun look blurry and making it hard to learn the gun.

It's a hate it or love it game but i would say MW2 runs smoother, has much more details and doesn't feel cheesy. But I have no regrets since i didn't dump 60 bucks.

I really enjoy video games, including all sorts of FPS. I'm a big fan of Modern Warfare, Halo, etc. So I was excited to get my hands on Black Ops.I'm not really into multiplayer, but Black Ops included the ability to add computer bots to multiplayer matches, which, in my opinion, EVERY game should do. With bots I can enjoy good multiplayer action without having to put up with all of the...how do you say 'idiots' nicely?...that you run into in online multiplayer. So that was a real plus.The single-player was an interesting experience, too. I wanted to like it. I really, really wanted to like it. But, like many games seem to be doing these days, I think Black Ops went too far with the content. The general gameplay wasn't so bad, but the single-player campaign contained some extremely violent and disturbing assassinations and such. There really was a lot of unnecessarily gruesome content. Yes, there is an option to turn off excessive gore and profanity, but even with that option on it was more than I ever want my kids to see.So, unfortunately, I had to get rid of it. I enjoyed it while I had it, but the more I played the more I realized it had crossed the line for me.

The story sucked me in deeply due to its mysteries throughout the missions. At first when I played, like the other Call of Duties I thought it was from point A to point B type of game. However honestly it is, but you tend to forget that as you played through your first time fascinated of how the plot of this game is going to fit into history. Within every story mission, especially the first few ones, you tend to believe that you have the power to alter history if your imagination stretched far enough. The fact that the first mission requires you to accomp -lish a certain thing, that tricks you into believing this goes into an alternate resolution of what actually happens in reality. Moving on from apart of the mysteries, the campaign's offers characters that gave you a sense of brotherhood. People who you would have had no problem to fight through Soviet or V.C. headquarters so save them, rushing to them in order to save them faster. Not saving all of the characters will have this effect on you but however a certain three or possibly four may do the trick. I felt like I was in debt with these people and when one dies for a noble cause I was affected by it. Sort of like after watching a Steven Spielberg's movie, where there are some characters where you would like to enjoy ice tea on the shores of Fiji. After when the heat is flushed out, and the sense of a accomplishment purifies the air. Therefore you can imagine what it would feel like when some dies, but that emotion soon passes as everything intensify in the story and makes you realizes that you have a job to finish.Similar to the quote from J.F.K. repeatedly said in the story, \"And those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future.\" The past, in your sense can be interpreted as the as death of your buddies and the future meaning to figure out what is going on in the present and sill happen later on, as the majority of the campaign took place in the past as flashbacks forcing to remember. Near the end was a twist and has amazing effects leading to the end when the feeling of heroism kicks in. Through the perspective of the character you feel like your job has been done, but on the outside the country's job has only begin as you realize it by seeing your surroundings.Then comes the zombie mode, playing as historical political figures like J.F.K. and Fidel Castro was a blast it gave a new feeling to it. Killing massive flocks of zombies with weapons that sounds and looks better ultimately better than World at War. Not saying that the overall appearance and some sounds of the game could have been better looking especially on the computer version. Zombie mode will probably keep me interested for the next two months. Unfortunately the online mode was the most frustrating, this is probably a big factor of why I gave this game three stars. As a veteran of Call of Duty sense the second game, after playing for a week this game gave me a feeling that I was still playing the previous Call of Duty. Even though the new customizations and currency factor was great, but after awhile that doesn't seem to have an affect to keep me continue playing anymore. For those who have had no complaints of the same mechanics of these games it's a perfect game for you.On the other hand I realized who could not blame them... after all it is a Call of Duty game. However now I just keep on getting camped by other players, and sometimes it affects me when I get kill three or four times in a row shortly after spawning. I thought I could overcome that by taking a different route but I soon found myself being overwhelmed. Since my teammates just wanted to run off and get kills on their own, including in objective games. That is the sole reason why I save the objectives games for just my friends and I, for we communicate and work as a team. And teamwork is hard to find on the Xboxlive community when playing with random people. And for some maps they are all great but there are other colors that would have map some of them look more attractive for the environment.Therefore overall I gave this game three stars up mainly do to it's campaign and zombies. However I got bored pretty quickly after playing the online multilayer, as I felt it did not offer me anything special.

You take on a character who relives scenes such as the Russian Roulette scene in Deer Hunter.It's fair to say that if you've watched any war movies, you've seen all the scenes involved here. You get the Dirty Dozen, Deer Hunter, Platoon, and more. The plots tend to be extremely scripted. You have one way to get through a scene and either you perfect it or you're stuck.The AI definitely doesn't win any awards. Many other games shine in AI, and this isn't it. Don't expect your friends to help out, and don't expect the enemy to think wisely either. You're mostly dealing with fairly simple robots who do what they think they were told to do.The infinite enemies is always something I get annoyed with. It means, if you're stealthy and careful, that you're penalized for being that way. Surely after the 800th enemy they have run out of backup!The voice acting is fairly good, and the video is good. If you're a fan of all those old war movies, which I admit I am, then there's a certain amount of fun being immersed in them. But there's one thing to enjoy being \"in the scene\" with Robert De Niro. It's another to be there and then annoyed by streams of never-ending enemies stalking at you like zombies.Speaking of which, there's a zombie mini-game in there. I do enjoy mini-games but this one was fairly silly. I suppose it doesn't cause any harm to have it added into the mix.

MW2 was my favorite so far. I received the product at a Gamestop's midnight release. I was happy to find that I could jump online and start playing with people right away. I haven't played the campaign mode, or zombies, so my review will be limited to what I have seen in multiplayer.Connection to games seems a little faster, and more fluid. The actual gameplay had little to no lag. The graphics are a big improvement over World at War (Treyarch's last call of duty). Compared to MW2 the graphics in black ops are cartoonish. The graphics are still amazing, it's just a different feel from MW2. There are some new things added to the gameplay. One is a monetary system that you can use to buy weapon unlocks, perks, and even equipment. Certain levels still have to be attained for weapons (same as MW2), but everything else can be unlocked as you get the money. For example, I was able to unlock the claymore as soon as I had 5,000 points (which happened pretty fast). There is a lot more customization in black ops. Apparently you can change your camo, and even face paint (I haven't leveled up that far yet). The weapons are of the cold war era, but a lot of weapons are showing up again (Famas, M16, MP5, etc.).  The perks are are pretty much the same as well (ghost=cold blooded, second chance=last stand). The kill-streak rewards are also pretty much the same (chopper gunner, bombings, spy plane, care packages). I haven't unlocked it yet, but there is a kill-streak that lets you fly a helicopter, and not just gun. Oh, the pesky dogs are back, and yes they still suck (one bite=dead). The knife is still all powerful (stabbing through hail of gunfire).The multiplayer does seem a lot fresher even though there isn't that much new stuff. It seems quicker, and more fluid. The maps are absolutely astonishing! A lot bigger than MW2, and a lot more detailed. One map has a missile launching in the background. The same game modes are here, but there is one new mode that I noticed. One called wager, where you can wage your points that you earned against others. Whoever wins gets to keep the pot. I have yet to play this game mode, but it seems like a cool idea.Overall I am very happy that I purchased the new Call of Duty. I didn't really like World at War, and in general didn't like the Treyarch versions of Call of Duty. This version is a worthy successor, but I wish there was a little more originality, and new features. At least Zombies has returned for round two, and apparently there is some kind of coop mode, but I am unsure of this.Definitely should be in your library.Update: 11/10/10So I played the campaign for a few hours today; two words: freaking awesome! The storyline is really immerses you, and I'm glad that this storyline is about the cold war. This theme has been remotely explored by some P.C. games, and even fewer console games.

I'll just bring up the points I think make this game very good, and the ones that made it very bad.Bad:The hit detection on sniper rifles is downright horrible.  With the Dragunov I can regularly settle the chevron reticle on a stationary character, fire, and hit absolutely nothing.  Sometimes twice in a row.  It's embarrassing.  The L96A1 seems to work better, but if you scope in, quickly track a target perfectly, settle your breathing, and fire--even if your cross hairs were perfectly centered--the game might just ignore it.  Treyarch, if you're reading this: FIX IT.  If I aim at someone and shoot, I expect the bullet to hit, not veer off to the side for no reason.  That's idiotic.  The generally cluttered maps also make it harder to effectively use the sniper rifles, considering one can just use an assault rifle in bursts to much the same effect, and be perfectly suited to close quarters as well.However the teams are set up, it's horribly unbalanced.  I always seem to be in games where either my team is completely destroying the other, or the other team is completely destroying mine.  Close games?  Ha!  Everyone fighting their hardest to keep themselves and their team-mates going to achieve victory?  No.  More like, one team gets a lead and camps out over the map and picks off anyone that runs by until the score limit is reached.Those RC-XD remote control cars with explosives are EVERYWHERE, always.  Sniping on a cliff?  There's one behind you.  About to take a position?  One in front.  How about tucked away in a corner at the edge of the map, laying prone to take a bite of sandwich?  Yeah, it's there, too.Good:All the reasons for \"boosting\" in Modern Warfare 2 or playing cheaply and most of the ability to do it have been eliminated.  Since gun customization is largely based on what you want rather than \"Get 150 head shots for this camo!\" you can spiff up your favorite firearm to your liking, and take down the enemies with it.  I especially like my Ice-camo Enfield with my waving Kirby emblem.  Spamming of explosives has been severely cut down with the loss of One Man Army and Danger Close.  Basically it's just a lot less cheap.The single-player campaign is pretty dynamic.  Missions are varied, action is fast and exciting.  Storyline is a lot more aggressive and feels more involving.  Rather than slide transitions with voice-overs to go from mission-to-mission ala MW2, you're much better set up to why and how the next mission is happening.  However as reviewers have mentioned: your team mates are idiots, and the enemies seem to have instant, perfect aim from any given distance.  Honestly, you can be lining up a sniper rifle on someone many yards away and they'll make solid hits on you with a pistol.Additions like the Crossbow, Ballistic Knife, and Tomahawk are fun to play with when you get sick of blasting away all the time.  Though to be fair, the Tomahawk is just a re-skinned Throwing Knife.All in all, I really see Black Ops as just a less cheap version of MW2 with different equipment and a better story.  But that's fine.  I played that game for an obscene amount of hours.One final note to parents considering buying this game for their kids this Christmas: you probably shouldn't.  There are a few quite graphic acts of violence throughout the single player campaign.  One notable incident is of the player character sawing through the neck of a Viet Cong soldier with the serrated back of a combat knife.

It was a breath of fresh air to actually feel I had some degree of control over my on screen character, and could actually engage other players on equal terms. After playing for a while though, that illusion soon vanished. Black Ops suffers from poor hit box detection, and the usual lag issues associated with peer to peer gaming. On top of the actual issues with the game mechanics, the game suffers from a limited number of maps that soon become dull, and not sure if there is map rotation issue, but some maps seem to appear time and time again. Expect to play a lot of WMD and Array. I think it says a lot about the quality of the maps, that when presented with the two possible choices, players will always vote for a random map, anything other than the ones they have been presented with. The only maps that players do seem to vote on are Nuke Town and Firing Range. The maps are also pretty small, so the sniper class seems redundant. This is little more than a gun and run game.Gun selection in this game is pretty much all eye candy, and really makes no difference at all. You can still shoot someone point blank with a shotgun any number of times and they will not go down, and firing on a person first is no sure guarantee that they will be killed. I particularly like the way as well that 50% of the time, enemy players can stroll past your claymore, which will then detonate well after you have been killed by said player. Oh, and watch out too for the poorly animated dog attacks. The blurb says a well timed knife attack can kill a dog, however, there are so few frames of animation on the dogs attacks, that one minute it is on the floor, the next it is on you! Oh, and speaking of knives, expect to be knifed by another player a few feet past them.Whack Ops may be fun if you have come from an even poorer game, in my case, the Gears Of War series, but at the end of the day, get ready for BS and WTF moments aplenty.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "BS and WTF moments a plenty!", "unixReviewTime": 1336176000, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2012"}

That being said I was excited for a new CoD, even though I was a bit skeptical; admittedly I wasn't a fan of CoD:WaW.I signed into XBL, and saw almost half my friends list playing CoD:BO, this doesn't mean much though most people jump on the newest games right away.  I started the game up and went into MP with a few friends, immediately I noticed the pixelated image while loading a map...I didn't pay much attention and waited for the game to start.  This is where my first bit of disappointment set in.  The guns look terrible in my opinion, little to no detail aside from a patch of rust here and there.  The details are extremely lackluster, looking like they copied and pasted right over from WaW.I set aside the graphics for awhile and started running around, the second disappointment was easily heard.  The sound in this game cant compare to the fantastic sound effects in MW2.  Foot steps all sound the same, like your running in a mucky swamp, when on screen its actually pool side at a villa. Grenades sound like poofs, and barely give my sub-woofers a chance to create the rumble.  Gunshots are mediocre at best, I just don't get the crack of the guns like other games I've been playing.  All in all I'm pretty much let down at this point.I must say the gameplay, the bread and butter of any video game is pretty decent.  I can let the graphics and sound off in there lack of wow factor, much like Treyarch did apparently.  I ranked up to a level 14, and had a pretty good time doing it.  The guns seem to actually kill enemies this time around, instead of allowing them to run around the corner after half a clip.  The perks are nice, and the upgrade and money system seems to be really nice, and different.I upgraded my M16 with a few goodies including; flamethrower, ACOG sight, grenade launcher, and a suppressor.  Purchased claymores which thank you Treyarch you can now MOVE!  Overall the online action is non-stop, which is a good thing for a FPS.  The ability to purchase upgrades at your own pace and preference is nice, and you notice not everybody is running around with a UMP, with commando and stopping power.I'm hoping to start a bit of the single player game this weekend (looks like snow and rain) so hopefully that impresses me a bit more than the things I mentioned above.If your a diehard fan of Call of Duty, especially Treyarch's versions definitely pick Black Ops up, its a decent game, and more than likely you'll get your money's worth from the MP and zombie modes alone.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent, Still a bit Disappointed...", "unixReviewTime": 1289347200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2010"}

I was a little worried about the fact that it was no longer being develop by Infinity Ward (the devs of Modern Warfare 2)  instead Treyarch. Developers of the dismal \"world at war\" installment. But having played Black Ops for a couple of days i can say that this is a big improvement over Modern Warfare 2. Which WAS the best FPS of all time until nowThe single player is not really BO's strong point. The AI mostly just stands there or charges at you like a rampaging horde. Their are times when my AI controlled members of my team, ran right past an enemy and didn't even fired and their were also times when i just happen to be standing next to an enemy and the guy didn't know i was there. Thankfully though, the weak AI isn't a game spoiler and the game is indeed challenging at some points. That is if you remember to turn off the auto aim feature  in the options menu. I do enjoy the whole story of a covert secret ops team working for the CIA. Which is told mostly through flashbacks from the main character. Their are some excellent cut scenes which are similar to those in \"World at War\" shown in between each mission. The entire look of the classified files, meshed in with film clips of the 1960's cold war as well as main character Mason's own memories just adds to the suspense.. Just try not to get a seizure while watching them. Fans of World at War can also expect some cameos from several of the Russian characters.Multiplayer is the beard and butter of the COD franchise and BO's is one the best on the market. The rules work similar to that of earlier COD games but instead of just working up experience points, you are awarded in game currency to purchase equipment, guns, killstreaks, and perks. Thus allowing you to work right away at creating your specs. Of course, some of the equipment and guns will still have to be unlocked over the course of time. Some of the most biggest complaints of the previous COD games has been addressed. No juggernaut, no scavenging claymores allowing you to camp, noob tubing isn't as bad as before, no game ending Nukes, as well as kill streaks not being the spawn camping nemesis they were in the MW2. It is a much better experience this time around. Some may be relieved for the changes to multiplayer while others may find it not to their liking.  I myself like it. Wager matches are a great way to break up the monotony of an online FPS. As well as earn money faster.Graphics  and music are movie quality. In fact Black Ops was actually produced with the same techniques as in the movie Avatar. This really sticks out in the Nam mission in which you can see even the smallest details of facial features. It almost makes me want to buy a 3D TV. I did notice that Treyarch reused the old \"URRUH\" chant from it's previous game as well as recycling other sounds. I only encountered one bug in the game so far in which i just simply killed myself and went to the last checkpoint.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The 800 pound gurilla of first person shooters", "unixReviewTime": 1289520000, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2010"}

Squires \"theDrizzle\"", "helpful": [65, 98], "reviewText": "I'm not going to go into too much detail since I've seen that other reviews have already covered a lot, but so far the game seems to be a huge improvement over MW2. Part of the reason might be just because I got bored of MW2, but I do believe that this game makes improvements.I've seen people posting that it's the same game as MW. Well first of all, it's a completely different game: different maps, characters, story, weapons, perks, challenges, killstreaks...etc. I don't know how that's the same game as MW, but let's just say that it is the same game...is that a bad thing? MW is one of the best games in the genre and looking like MW and playing like MW isn't a bad thing. To say that Treyarch didn't make something unique is just stupid.They've kept similar core concepts to the game with a few exceptions:1) They've balanced the weapons more fairly2) They've made the killstreaks a little less devestating. They're still cool, but they don't allow you to completely dominate the other team as easily as in MW23) They added cool new perks; camera you can leave is really cool ideaThe graphics are could be considered inferior to MW, but I actually think that in some ways they're better. The framerate and some of the smooth textures seem to be lacking, but the level of details and the overall look of the maps is really intricate and just awesome I think. If you played WAW then you know that Treyarch has a different way of doing the visuals, but they're still pretty sweet. So, I'd say that they're different but not necessarily inferior to IWs visuals.I haven't played enough of this game to say that it's the game of the year yet, but my first impressions are that it's an improvement on MW2 and it's definatly the game I've been waiting for. If you read the one star reviews and decide not to pick this up then you're really missing out on a fun time. If you loved the other COD games and you like the old Vietnam error weapons and themes, then this game should be a lot of fun for youUPDATE:I've played a lot more of the multiplayer now so I'd like to make a few comments:1) The contract system is really cool. You'll have to stay on top of your contracts to maximize your potential for earning upgrades, but it really makes the matches a lot more fun. I've always got three different contracts going on, so I can earn extra points towards weapon and perk upgrades. (contracts are a way of gambling to complete tasks with your virtual currency and you can make extra cash if you complete the challenges in a set amount of game time.)2) I'd like to touch on the graphics again. Most of the levels are just stunning to me. If anything, I think they look and feel better than previous MW games. The level of detail and lighting effects are fantastic. There's also a lot of interactive things happening in the maps that can cause enemies to die or give you advantages. In one of the stages, a rocket launches...pretty fun to watch if your enemies aren't giving you too much of a challenge.3) Being able to upgrade your weapons and choose your perks is awesome. I've made my SMG and assault rifle really sweet now using the virtual currency and it's great to earn extra doing contracts.4) They have a world map similar to the one that was in Halo that shows you all the lights on the globe where people are playing...there's no one playing in Madagascar...that's too badCons:Matchmaking is severely broken as of now. I'm sure they'll fix it as soon as possible, but right now if you have a party bigger than three people, you'll probably have trouble joining games. Some of these issues may be related to moderate or strict NATs, but since it doesn't tell you what your NAT settings are in the game, we weren't 100% on that. You can always check through the Xbox network settings and if your NAT settings are not open, you may need to enable DMZ or port forward...just do a google search.Also, connections are showing up 3 or 4 green bars, but there still seems to be significant lag in some of the levels. This varies from match to match and I'm confident that they should be resolving it soon.The more I play this game, the more I love it. I'm really shocked to see so many negative reviews. I guess expectations were really high for this and there's a lot of haters out there.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You've played the rest, now try the best", "unixReviewTime": 1289260800, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2010"}

Modes.Concept:  10/10Black Ops is the latest installment of the Call of Duty Series.  There is a 6 hour Campaign with 4 Difficulty Levels, a Single Player / Co-op Zombie Game similar to Left 4 Dead, and Multiplayer with Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Blow Stuff Up Objectives.  There is an awful lot of gaming crammed onto this disk!Story:  8/10You are Mason, voiced by Avatar's Sam Worthington, and you begin the game being \"roughly interrogated\" by the CIA.  The fate of the free world is at stake and the only way to save it is to crack a code that has been imbedded into your subconscious.  Mason recounts his adventures with the Black Ops during the cold war and you play through them.  The story is vastly improved over Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 (Which isn't saying much because that game made as much sense as Transformers 2.)Graphics: 9/10The Call of Duty series is known for its stunning graphics and intense gameplay.  Black Ops delivers, yet again.  Although, I remember the Modern Warfare games looking just a bit better, Black Ops still looks great.  The backgrounds and visual effects are very well rendered.  Normally, I'd say, \"The graphics pull you into the action,\" at this point...  Keep reading.Gameplay: 7/10Most of the game has you running through missions as part of a squad, going from checkpoint to checkpoint as exciting things happen all around you.  You have an arsenal of guns and grenades at your disposal.  The weapons are well balanced and feel great.  However, the AI definitely needs more work.  In the Call of Duty series, you don't need super complex AI because characters die so quickly, they aren't onscreen very long.  However, the AI characters need to do a much better job at convincing the Player that he or she is in a war.  There were too many times in the Campaign where Viet Cong and US Marines simply stood next to each other like co-workers at the water cooler talking about last night's game.  Issues like this break the immersion of a battle and the game quickly devolves into an ultra loud shooting gallery.Level Design:  7/10There are combat missions, stealth missions, and vehicle missions where you destroy things and progress to clearly marked checkpoints.  Most of the missions in the game are intense and exciting, but there are a few that are far from great.  Infinitely spawning enemies and counter-intuitive checkpoints ruin the fun.  Once this starts happening, you feel like saying, \"Ok, Designer Guy, what do you want me to do?\"  Instead of feeling like you are fighting in actual battles.  There are 4 different Difficulty Modes for the Campaign and it should take you about 6 hours to complete it.Sound:  10/10Great Voice Acting + Loud Explosions and Gunfire = 10!The sound is so good, my neighbor complained about the noise!If that's not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is.Zombies:  6/10Black Ops also features a fun little Zombie game where you are in a building that is under attack by waves of zombies.  You set up barricades and kill them to earn points.  You use those points to buy better weapons or open doors to expand the level.  This is a fun little mini-game that feels a bit like Left 4 Dead.  People either play it a few times and quit, or get hooked.  To progress past level 5 in the game, you have to be a great gamer or you need some good old fashioned Co-op teamwork.Multiplayer:  8/10The Multiplayer Modes are back and there are plenty of them.  Black Ops feels well balanced and the upgrade system allows you to purchase weapons and customize your gear.  The maps and gameplay feel really solid and it's always satisfying to shoot someone online.  The Call of Duty Kill Streaks are back, allowing Players to wreak havoc on the map as a reward for killing sprees.  Call in spy planes, assault choppers, mortar strikes, napalm...  The Multiplayer Modes are typically fun for the competitive gamers.Maturity:  MThere are some intense scenes of violence in this game, so it's definitely not for kids.Although, when I play online, I swear half of the people with microphones are 12.Overall: 8/10Call of Duty Black Ops is not the best in the series, but it's definitely fun.  If you want a great looking, intense, shooting gallery, with some multi-player modes, you will enjoy this game!Buy it if you want a decent Campaign with a Good Story and you want to take advantage of the Multiplayer Modes.Rent it if you only want to play through the Campaign.  You can do this in 1 or 2 days.Avoid it if you hate violence, explosions, testosterone, swearing, and killing.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Glass is Half Full!", "unixReviewTime": 1292457600, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2010"}

I probably will take quite some time before I actually play this game online with others, if ever, so I cannot review that aspect, what I can review is the single player and as far as that goes this game is pretty solid.The plot elements of Black Ops are way up there, the story is just fantastic. It has a mystery to it that the main character doesn't really know what's going on and they do an awesome job of making it feel like you are right there in his shoes. It actually had 1 moment where I was pretty darn sad (WAW fans may feel what I am saying on this one.) 5 stars thereGraphics wise it has really awesome moments, the cinemas are really cool and some of the vehicle chases are just outstanding, but it really is nothing new as far as the COD franchise goes and isn't quite up to par with IF's MW2. So 4.5 Stars there.Gameplay is pretty standard as far as any 1st person shooter is concerned. There are some really cool stealth sections though and again the vehicle escapes are fantastic. My main problem though is that it seems a little glitchy. I have a friend who also has the game that says he has moments where he can't move his gun at all and while I personally have not had the I have had issues with the AI characters not going where they are supposed to or not moving at all. It only gets super frustrating when those characters have to follow or at least get to where you're going in order to progress through the level. Hasn't happened a lot but it is aggravating. only 4 stars thereI'm not burning through the game as i want to make the campaign as long as possible but I imagine it is going to only net 7 hours of gameplay on regular difficulty. As far as that goes though it doesn't really bother me because I already know I will play through the campaign quite a few more times. For all of the guys saying MW2 is so much better I really have to bring it back to gameplay time there too, only 6 hours regular. All FPS's now are going away from long campaigns and focusing on the multiplayer so really it's nothing to say that this game is a piece of crap when you say how awesome MW2 is having the same short campaign time. 4 StarsMy favorite COD game thus far has been WAW so I may be a little biased here but I think Treyarch did a really good job overall and I would rate Black Ops a 4.5 overall.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Worth the price of admission", "unixReviewTime": 1289779200, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2010"}

What this means is that you need an active XBOX Live Gold account to access the mode.  So yes, you need internet access and an online gold account to play against bots.  Annoying to say the least.Far more annoying to me is that Combat Training (to play solo or versus friendS according to Treyarch) is limited to two players split screen.  So I bought the game with the hopes of playing four player split screen vs the bots or Zombies, to find out that it's not an option.The only OFF line four player split screen options are modes with all guns, etc... unlocked, no leveling up system, and absolutely NO BOTS.  It's decent, and having searched more I've found a few articles published days before release that clarified what Treyarch and Activision had purposely deceived consumers into believing.The campaign is okay.  Some really cool moments, but I can only play for about 30 minutes before I get tired of just laying waste to thousands of mineless enemies.  Online mulitplayer takes some getting used to.

This game has a lot going for it that makes me want to love it but it seriously fails in the two areas I need the most in a good FPS game - maps that make you stay up longer than you should and awesome guns that you want to keep using.  If the hitboxes weren't so awful and it had at least 1 gun I could trust I could see myself liking this game and playing it awhile.  But being a very competitive person who prides himself on what he can do with the right tools this game just frustrates the living hell outta me.In other FPS games my aim is rock solid (both PC and 360) and I pride myself in my accuracy rating ...but in this game I spray and pray because this game rewards mediocrity.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Game rewards mediocrity", "unixReviewTime": 1290729600, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2010"}

As other reviewers have pointed out, black ops is modern warfare 2...set in 1968.  First, I've got to say that the sheer amount of content packed into this game is absolutely staggering, but just content isn't enough to fill some of the game's flaws.  My main criticism is that Treyarch have seemed to just copy-and-paste modern warfare 2 and make some balancing tweaks and add new perks.  Hell, even the graphics are slightly inferior, which is just odd.  The RC car is absolutely overpowered, worse than the predator missile found in modern warfare 2.  A few things I have to applaud treyarch for doing are no nuke, insane customization, and a more balanced game.  I've experienced a few glitches and infinite care package glitches here and there, which is just mind-boggling.  How could that specific glitch make its way back into black ops from modern warfare 2?  If you're just an ordinary call of duty fan that absolutely loved modern warfare 2, you'll either hate it or love it depending on what aspects of modern warfare 2 you liked.  The single-player is the second best I've played in a cod game, second only to infinity ward's excellent and brilliantly paced call of duty 4: modern warfare campaign.  The pacing in black ops is absolutely over-the-top.  There is never a time to catch your breath, the explosions just keep on coming, and bullets keep on firing.  For some people, this may be a good or bad thing.Now, the multi-player is the meat of the game as that's where you'll be spending your hours away.  For the most part, everything seems polished and balanced although the RC car has got to be the worst kill-streak I've ever had to experience.  Unlocked only after 3 kills, this thing freaking kills like a mad-dog.  It's just overpowered.  Other than that, I don't have any gripes at the moment other than that infinite care package glitch that some people are using all the time now.Overall, black ops is an enjoyable experience with tons of replay value packed just like any other call of duty game.I rate it 4.5/7 overall and I suggest you buy it when you can.  Solid game, although it seems too much like a copy-and-paste and refine job to me.  Also, the removal of campaign co-op mode was disappointing.  I don't know why treyarch would take that feature out when they first introduced it in world at war.  The strong familiarity of many aspects of the game along with slightly inferiority in graphics is well made up for with the large amount of content packed into this game including the beloved zombies mode which is an absolute blast to play!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "It's a refined MW 2...set in a different time period", "unixReviewTime": 1289260800, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "AHXNC2DKPUDPT", "asin": "B003JVKHEQ", "reviewerName": "Spartan", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This review is going to be divided into 3 different areas: Singleplayer, Multiplayer, and Zombies. I will also give you the basic ratings at the bottom of the review.Singleplayer: Average COD campaign, it was short, intense, and entertaining. Surprisingly though Black Ops adds a bit of a psychological twist to the campaign which was nice to see for once. The story is pretty basic and didn't look like it took much time to think of. Once you've finished the campaign you probably won't go back, as there isn't really a purpose to. Also in campaign there are 40 \"intels\" located throughout the levels. Collect all of the intels and all you get is achievement points, I felt that they should of rewarded the player more for finding these.Multiplayer: This is where most COD fans spend the most time. Expect everything like perks, camos(which completely fall flat in this game), attachments, challenges, and killstreaks to return. Nothing new to the gameplay is added. The pro perks are a lot harder to get this time around. The camos are horrendous and looked like they were made on the paint accessory by some 6 year old kid. The killstreaks seem more balanced and the Tactical Nuke is gone. There are a lot more challenges which will help you level up faster. They have added a couple new attachments like the Flamethrower, dual mag, infra-red scope, and lower powered scopes. There are also a lot more guns, but lots of them go unused as they don't compare to the better ones. Another thing I really can't stand in this game are the maps. In MW2 I liked almost all of the maps but in BO I don't really like any. They are all to basic and have a boring feel to them. The leaderboards are also back in BO as expected. Except from some strange reason THEY DONT HAVE LEADERBOARDS FOR KILLS/WINS/ and SCORE, instead you have to look at someone's \"Combat Record\", which shows all their stats. Instead there are just leaderboards for game modes, which vary based on the objectives. Oddly enough, they don't record your amount of wins for each specific game mode, only the score per minute. They do have quite a bit of interesting stats in the Combat Record so its not that bad. Prestige mode is still here too, now its up to 15 levels though. The matchmaking online is also a problem. It can take up to 10 minutes to find a game sometimes. Also you'll be in a game and it will all of the sudden lose connection, which can be frustrating because it occurs all of the time. They have added something called Combat Training, which is multiplayer except with bots that can be adjusted to your liking. Also the game has split-screen online! Nice job Treyarch we've been waiting for this. To sum it up lets say the multiplayer is just like MW2, except with no tactical nuke or constant noob tubes. There are still issues like bad spawning and glitching, but we can't fix that.Zombies: Definitely the best part of the game. This was an instant hit from WaW so there was no doubt they would bring it back. The game starts off with 2 maps, Kino Der Toten and Five. There is also and arcade type zombie mode which is like a top down shooter. Kino Der Toten is a large zombie theatre. It is without a doubt the best zombie map, Treyarch really did well with this. It includes everything that the older zombie maps did plus new stuff, like the turning the power on, the random box, pack a punch, hellhounds, powerups, perks, rayguns and everything else you can think off. They add the new \"Thundergun\" and these new zombies which are called \"Nova crawlers\", they faster than regular crawlers and when shot they emit nova gas which distorts the players view. The map Five is not as good. It is smaller and quite difficult. Instead of dogs, the player will come across a scientist who takes your weapons. Five takes place in the Pentagon, and the players are Nixon, Castro, JFK, and the VP whose name I can't think of. Recently released map Ascension is also very fun. It is huge and is a lot harder than Kino and Five. Expect all of the same with new stuff. New perks include StaminUp(Makes you run faster and unlimited sprint) and PhD flopper(No explosive damage and creates explosion when diving). A new powerup is included called Death Machine, which gives whoever grabs it a minigun with unlimited bullets for 30 seconds. Death Machine is quite useful as it kills zombies instantly, also it shows up frequently. Instead of dogs and nova crawlers, you get Space monkeys! These are annoying and will completely wreck your game. The monkeys fly down usually around round 7 or 8. The monkeys go for the perk machines and if they touch them you lose that perk, they will also try to kill you if you're in the way. They aren't too difficult to kill but they can gang up on you which will be troubling. Ascension holds a lot of secrets and easter eggs which I won't spoil here.Graphics- 9/10Sound effects- 8/10Campaign- 7/10Multiplayer- 7/10Zombies- 10/10", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Mediocre game, a step back", "unixReviewTime": 1298073600, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2011"}

Bottom line is if you like Call of Duty games, you'll like this. It's got everything you'd expect: Over the top single player, variety of weapons and levels, and an addictive multiplayer. And zombies.The single player game is maybe not as strong as far as gameplay goes as it's predecessor, Modern Warfare 2, but it's not quite on the same grand scale. However, as far as characters and story go, this is probably the best Call of Duty campaign of the whole series. The game has numerous twists and turns you won't see coming, and it all comes to a satisfying conclusion. I don't want to talk too much about the story as to avoid spoiling it. Also, the varied time periods and player characters keep the game very interesting. The voice acting, featuring Sam Worthington, Ed Harris and Gary Oldman is also very strong.The multiplayer has been overhauled from Modern Warfare 2, and some of the changes are great, others not so much. Instead of completing challenges to upgrade your guns and equipment, there is now an in game currency used for customization. This is great as you can pick and choose what weapons and upgrades you get and in what order, but it's not quite as exciting as the old system. \"3 more kills and I get the tactical knife\" is much more interesting than \"3 more kills and I get a couple of hundred call of duty points.\" Still, it works, and is very addictive. The addition of wager matches, where you play customized game modes to win points (or lose them) is very exciting and having these modes to play as alternatives to standard modes adds a lot of life to the game.Zombie mode is a lot of fun, if too similar to the mode in World at War. It's a great time with friends, but solo zombies is a little flat. This game really could have used a Special Ops mode like Modern Warfare 2, as that could be a lot of fun alone.Overall I'd recommend it if you like Call of Duty games or other fast paced action shooters.

{"reviewerID": "A32FDGA30QCLRX", "asin": "B003JVKHEQ", "reviewerName": "S. Posey", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewText": "Call of Duty is a name well known in the video game world.  The game is released every year or two and each release brings with it tremendous sales and an insanely loyal (when they get what they want) online fan base.  Modern Warfare 2 from developer Infinity Ward was a success but didn't receive the critical praise it's predecessor garnered.  With Treyarch's turn to woo the world at hand with a new game, will they succeed or are they forever doomed to be that other development company behind Infinity Ward.I'm probably one of the only people in the world who buys Call of Duty games for the single player experience.  I view the multiplayer as an added bonus that I play, but I'm mainly interested in the single player component first and foremost.  With that said, this review is going to focus primarily on the single player first and then I'll cover the multiplayer.  To date, I've beaten the campaign on normal difficulty and played about 5-6 hours of online multiplayer including zombie mode.  So, how does the game stack up compared to others?  In my opinion, it's the best yet.The single player story begins with your character (Mason) tied up in a room with TV screens all around you.  Someone from an overhead viewing window is yelling at you to remember some set of numbers.  After some introductions between the two characters and Mason realizing he's capture, you begins to flashback to the past at certain points in Mason's life, all circling around the Cold War and all playing a part to tell the story.  The first area you go to is Cuba where you are on a mission to kill Castro during the Bay of Pigs.  When you are finished the mission, you are whisked back to the interrogation room in current time.  The game is played through a sort of flashback segments that work incredibly well to tell the story.  Gone are the days of long hikes in a field to get to the next objective...instead, you are just transported there due to a memory jump.  Think of it sort of like Assassin's Creed but not exactly.During the story, you'll control a couple characters, but Mason is the main one.  I've heard some reviewers say that since you flash to and from a lot that you never get invested in the characters and their story but I didn't find that to be true.  I was definitely invested in the story from the get go and felt for each character.  The story overall though is the best you've ever seen in a Call of Duty game.  I'm a huge story fanatic when it comes to video games and I found myself looking forward to cutscene after cutscene to see what was going to happen next.  The story is great, but you might see the end twist coming a mile away like I did.  Still, it's a great story and it's a welcome addition to the series.The gameplay is the same formula you know and love from the Call of Duty franchise, except with the story set anywhere from 1948 to 1968 in the Cold War, you're going to be using a lot of different guns.  But, since you are an elite Black Ops team member, you'll have access to some weapons that others have never heard of for the times, like a shotgun that has exploding bullets that set targets on fire.  Something else that was more prominent in this game vs. the others was the use of vehicles.  There's some driving sequences but the really fun stuff takes place in the air in helicopters.  There's also a level where you start in a spy plane scouting the ground for a team trying to advance in a snow storm.  They can't see so they need you to guide them.  You have to navigate them around enemies and patrols and if they engage anyone the action zooms into the team and you take over for them.  This was an awesome mission that I really enjoyed, although it was short.  The combat in Black Ops is very similar to the other games so if you liked those, you'll be fine with this one as well.The entire story will last you around 6-8 hours depending on how you play it.  I tend to take my time and explore areas so it lasted longer for me.  Just because the single player game is short though, don't think you won't get your money.  Besides multiplayer (which I'll cover soon) there are other features included on the disc.  For starters, Zombie mode returns with the same winning formula that got it so much attention the first time around.  For those of you who aren't familiar with the mode, you play someone stuck in a building with zombies trying to get in.  You shoot to kill while also bording up windows and unlocking new areas to keep you safe.  Each kill nets you money which can be used to open up said areas or unlock new weapons.  It's great fun and you can even do it with a few other people.  I would have liked to see some more changes to it since it basically is the same game as before, but there is one awesome change they made that you'll see as soon as you beat the campaign.  I won't ruin the surprise.Something else included with the game is a top down shooter that can be unlocked from the main menu.  You need to break out of your restraints on the main menu by rapidly hitting the right and left triggers.  When you stand up, make your way to the computer and interact with it.  You can enter in two codes, DOA and zork.  DOA opens the top down shooter that is co-op enabled and something I would have gladly paid 10 bucks for on the marketplace.  The other is zork, a MUD that you probably won't play ever again after messing with it for a couple seconds.  Both open a new achievement though, so, you're welcome for the codes.The graphics in the game are nice, but nothing spectacular.  It looks like the engine they used in previous games hasn't been tweaked much since the models and explosions look very similar.  This isn't bad, just nothing new.  I did see some screenshot and video comparisons of the 360 version and PS3 and the 360 version is easily discernible as the better graphical version.  The only reason I say this is if you are like me and have both consoles and you want the better looking one, the Xbox 360 is the way to go with this one.  But, if you don't pay for Xbox Live, the choice is already made up for you.  Just something to keep in mind.Ok, on to the multiplayer.  The multiplayer this time around got a pretty big overhaul in terms of Call of Duty changes.  You still level up just like in previous iterations, but the levels come a lot faster.  Instead of unlocking weapons and perks at specific levels, you earn currency in the rounds that you use to buy items.  So, when you hit a certain level a bunch of weapons/perks, etc. become available for purchase all at once.  You then level up and earn money which you can then go and buy the one you want.  Hardcore fans of the multiplayer might be disappointed with the change, but I think it's a welcome addition.  I'm not a huge multiplayer fan because of the time sink involved.  With this new method, I can get to a level, earn some cash, and then buy my favorite weapon instead of having to level up a ton more to get it.  You get what you want, when you want it, in the order you want it.  You'll still have things to look forward to since certain weapons are only available at different levels.  Along with these changes, there is also a theatre mode (like Halo has with it's forge) where you can watch gameplay videos from your games and then change camera angles, save, and upload to the net for others to see.  I haven't played with this yet, but I did view some from other people.  The community is already taking part in it and it looks to be a defining feature of the online game experience.The customization is another aspect of the multiplayer game that has been adjusted.  Your first perk you choose decides what your character will look like.  You actually get to see a ragdoll of your character and you can change the perk to change the look.  You're going to pick the perk you like best and not the look but it's still near to see your character before going into the game.  Before, weapons decided the look, now it's the first perk.Another new feature to the online multiplayer is the wager system.  As I stated before, you earn money from rounds to buy things.  Well, if you are a gambling man, you can bet money to win more money.  There are a couple new modes (which I haven't tried out yet so I'll keep this brief) which allow you to bet money to place in the top 3.  These modes include things like \"One in the Chamber\" where you get one bullet and a knife to kill everyone.  Kill someone, and get another bullet.  Others involve bow and arrows and incremental guns with each kill.  This is going to be a fan favorite for a lot of people do to the very competitive nature of the games.  But, if you aren't that great at multiplayer but still want to bet a little, you can do the contract system.  With these, you pay to accept a contract and then try to meet it within the time frame.  For instance, the one I took yesterday had me pay 50 bucks to get 10 kills in the next round.  When I did, I won my money back plus some.  It's a neat system that people are going to love.  If you don't, just ignore it since it won't affect you.Call of Duty: Black Ops is a huge game.  So huge, that you would expect all of it's features to come on two discs, but they don't.  Treyarch has gone above and beyond the \"call\" to make something that is not only a great game, but is their own.  This is the game that sets them apart from Infinity Ward.  World at War was a great game, but there was still a feeling leaving them as the other developer.  That sentiment is now gone with Treyarch's love and affection put into a game that is the pinnacle of the series.  Black Ops is hands down the best Call of Duty to date.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Call of Duty: Black Ops - Review", "unixReviewTime": 1289433600, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2010"}

It's truly remarkable.Second, Ops delivers so much content. Again - so much content. No arguments here: you get the single player campaign (about 12-14 hrs.), zombies (which has spawned DLC Rezurrection), and multiplayer (brimming with tons of accessories for weapons, callsigns, different game types). On top Treyarch also released DLC for Ops, meaning more maps and more hours of fun.Third, the game looks fantastic, a clear step up from Modern Warfare (yeah, I know it's two different companies producing titles). There are more shadows, realistic environments, and moving objects. There are also contracts you can buy to increase your stats and your money. The end battle report is more detailed and fun to read.I didn't give Ops five stars for technical reasons and for the new money system used to buy weapon add-ons and callsigns. The game lags sometimes and drops the connection more than I expected. I assumed they would've dealt with this problem before. Also, I didn't like having to buy everything, especially weapon add-ons that I unlocked already, and the emblems for weapons, reticle types, camouflage design for weapons, and callsigns. I loved earning callsigns and emblems from MW2. Buying them isn't as enticing.That's it. Black Ops is worth it.

This is a review for the gamer who just wants to have a good time. After playing through this game, I had a blast. It's rare for me to be so absorbed into a game and dedicated to beating it on the spot nowadays. Games just seem to have lost their charm. But Treyarch sure outdid themselves with this one.This is coming from a person who HATED World at War. It just wasn't for me. Taking notes from Infinity Ward's COD game last year, Modern Warfare 2, Treyarch took what that team did right and perfected it. This game had me in awe on every level as I played through it. It's so full of action, the budget I'm sure is in the millions.This game really makes you feel a part of it as you play through the levels. It's not just simple run in a room and kill everyone, then move on to the next. It has constant changes to the environment that you must adapt to, such as a bridge you are running on gets a huge hole blown in it, and as you almost fall to your death your teammate helps you up. The A.I. characters aren't just cardboard cut outs like in some games, they actually have a personality to them, and they help you out on your missions. I actually felt for them when they were killed.One thing I like about Black Ops is you are never lost. Thanks to handy indicators, it's always easy to know where to go, or what your next target is. The control is spot on. Aiming is precise, and the weapons handle like the real thing. You are going to blow through hundreds of enemies, yet everybody in the game seems to have their own way of living, the ways that they hide behind cover, shoot at you, scream to their squad you are coming, and the ways they die. It's not the same animations over and over, everything seems new as you come to it.The game always knows when to switch up the flow of the action. There are so many different vehicles and such that you find yourself in, it's always something new. You might be in a boat, shooting missles at everything in sight. You'll find yourself in a tank, raining absolute carnage on anyone and everyone around. This game feels like the most epic action movie of all time, yet it could never be a movie because the budget would be in the billions.It's just so fun to play this. I haven't had as much fun with a game in years, to be honest. I'm not some typical COD fratboy who lives and breathes for this series, I'm just a normal gamer and I came into this game expecting a great time. This game exceeded my expectations, it blew me away. The campaign has a great, detailed story and was also quite long for an FPS title. You travel all over the world, and it's just great to see these environments.The graphics are beautiful, absolutely stunning. I'm sure that this game pushed the 360 to it's hardware potential. It's certainly the best FPS on the console, and probably the best FPS of the last decade.For some reason I was reminded of Goldeneye on N64 as I played through this game. Missile silos, facilities, jungles.. it's all there. Yet as much as I loved that game back in 1997, I don't think I had as much fun with it as I did this game. Black Ops really brought it's story to life, and really drew me into the game. I felt for the characters, I would jump and scream as I stormed through absolute chaos, blasting everything in sight. It was just a great experience, and I haven't had this much fun in a long time.I even see myself replaying this campaign, which again is something I rarely do. I strongly suggest this game to everyone. Whether you like games, wars, or just straight up action, you have got to get this.

Well first off, they are wrong. In the past few years, I have seen some major improvements in the Call of Duty franchise. Most would say(including me) that these improvements are legendary.

Oh, just to let you know, the levels are flashbacks to get the answers I was previously talking about.Okay, I've gotten through the single player, now lets go to the multiplayer! I have heard major flack about the multiplayer. Treyarch amped up the multiplayer to a whole new level. You get a way bigger variety of multiplayer modes. And the truth is, you get some pretty wacky modes. For example, you get wager matches. I gotta to tell you, that could very well be the best mode. Okay, so the multiplayer maps are pretty good.

I am not a \"hard core\" COD fan or a \"MW2 fanboy\". I actually hated the original Modern warfare game but enjoyed the 2nd (don't ask why, I don't understand either). I also attribute the reason that there's so many bugs and differences in this game compared to others because Treyarch is now the developer of the COD series. The old developer, Inifity Ward, made every COD game until now, and for some reason Activision decided to drop them and pick up Treyarch. Not sure why, but if I did some research I'm sure I could find out. Anywho, the game play is fairly good, and the graphics are nice as well. I don't use an HD tv (20 inch CRT) but everything still looks really good so I can only imagine what it's like in 1080p.Let me get to the Campagin. I haven't finished it yet, but it seems solid. I don't really understand what it is completely about (why he's strapped down and who's talking to him) but I'm sure that will come in time. The AI seems fairly decent, especially since they have killed me numerous times and angered me to the point of having to turn the game off. I haven't experienced many bugs in the campagin which is good. The voice actors are good (Ice T!) and it seems pretty straight forward. I don't expect the game play to take much longer because the Campagin's for COD series are usually relatively short and most of the emphasis is based upon the multiplayer and other lil things you can do in the game (Easter Eggs too!).This brings me to the multiplater...which really needs a massive patch. I have read reviews on here that state players having trouble getting into the games, creating parties, and parties always being dropped. I am right there with you. Treyarch royally screwed up the multiplayer. I think they wanted to push this game out so fast that they didn't test it far enough in the labs. Other bugs include shooting enemies but the shots not registering (and when they kill you, it looks like your just standing there with your thumb up your butt), grenade pins being pulled but the grenade mysteriously disappears when you die (common, isn't this supposed to be \"realistic\"? If i pull the pin and I die before the grenade is thrown, the grenade should still blow up!), and other various bugs that make the game really hard to continue playing.I do not agree with Activision's choice to drop Inifity Ward and make Treyarch the new COD developer. I think if activision would have kept their agreements with Inifity Ward, this game could have been better. I would honestly have rather waited another month or so for all the bugs to be fixed, then to play a game that jerks and doesn't play right. Maybe I'll update this review when they do patch everything (if that happens) but as of right now, this is why I give the game 3 stars.

Nield", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Below I have rated and reviewed each of the gameplay modes...SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN (3/5)The campaign is okay. It's short though. It is approximately 4-6 hours of gameplay. It starts pretty slow for the first two hours, takes some unforeseen twists and turns, and then gets pretty interesting. The last two hours are pretty adrenaline-filled. The \"Nova 6\" gas was a pretty good horror element, creating disturbing scenes and moments of despair.The character development was poor, especially compared to Modern Warfare 2 or even World at War. I didn't care much about the main characters and I had no idea who they were. I just knew I was supposed to follow some rambo guy with no personality.MULTIPLAYER CAMPAIGN (3/5)COD has a distinctive multiplayer. The mechanics simply are \"whoever shoots first wins\". You have to be ultra aggressive and reckless in multiplayer to even get a few kills. The maps are small, claustrophobic, and are not sniper friendly. There is little room for tactics and strategy. It's a game of reflexes and nothing else. Some people like that, others don't. It's very hard to be stealthy too. An alternative multiplayer game for those who don't like this style is Battlefield: Bad Company 2. The maps are a lot more spacious and its much easier to hide and plan. Anyway, I digress. I heard that on February 1st the first Black Ops DLC pack would be more sniper friendly and have more \"vertical\" terrain. We'll see what happens.ZOMBIES (5/5)Who doesn't love the zombies mode introduced in World at War? The COD zombies experience is memorable and one of the best zombie games ever made. You and up to three friends have to fight off increasingly difficult waves of Nazi or Commie zombies while upping your game by buying new weapons, opening new areas, and utilizing traps. It's ridiculously addicting and provides a compulsive experience.The map Kino der Toten is really fun. I guess the developers were inspired by the movie Inglorious Basterds to make this map. It's a run down Nazi movie theater with several rooms, an outdoor alley, and a large theater. There's even a camera room you can teleport to that features the pack-a-punch machine and is inaccessible to the zombies. You only have 30 seconds at a time in that haven though.\"Five\" is a tongue-in-cheek trip of hilarity and horror. Players fight as JFK, Nixon, MacNamara, and Castro in the zombie-breached Pentagon. On top of the pack-a-punch, mystery box, and other elements from the past maps... there's elevators that you'll want to camp out in when things get overwhelming, as well as a thief that \"steals\" your equipped weapon every 7 rounds... unless you gun him down which is hard. It's good clean fun.In the \"First Strike\" DLC which comes out in February, there will be a new zombie map called \"Ascension\". I hope they release the classic zombie maps from World at War too.OVERALLBlack Ops is worth getting for zombies alone. Multiplayer may or may not be to your tastes, COD veterans will probably like it... newcomers may have a hard time getting a kill streak going.

Zombies is great but gets old after awhile.  As players have stated there was alot of lag last night online for multiplayer & zombies so I hope this is fixed as well but that didn't bother me because I jumped in to campaign mode.  Now as far as campaign goes this is Treyarch's best campaign yet.  I wasn't particularly impressed with the World at War's campaign because I thought it dragged a little and I loved Call of Duty 4's campaign so that could of been a factor.  But I digress in this installment it is actually better than MW2's campaign which I also liked but felt it was way to short.  Whoever said the graphics weren't as good as MW2 is a lie, its actually 10x better than MW2.  Its also the first installment in the COD franchise to include 3D, although I haven't been able to test this out because I don't have a 3D TV I can see that it would actually be a pretty cool game in 3D and I am not a big fan of 3D.  The only problem I have with this game is they seemed to have copied Halo Reach and call it there own.  Voting for maps, leveling up, character customization, and video recording all features that Halo Reach had and previous Halo games had for a long time and now its just being put into a COD game.  Also I forgot to mention split-screen online COD has only 2 player while Halo has always had 4 player split-screen and campaign coop.  Now speaking of campaign coop this is the reason I gave Black Ops 4 stars this game DOES NOT have campaign coop or even a special ops mode thats like campaign coop.  I would think with a $60 price tag they would of gave us more than just zombies as form of coop.  The campaign would of been really fun with an exta player and an arcade style campaign they had in World at War which I thought was fun.  I guess they call it single-player for a reason o well.  The multiplayer and zombies are exactly the same from previous games so if your a COD veteran you will see no difference in gameplay.  The only thing that is different is getting money from matches and buying your guns and or attachments.  So all in all this a great game and a great time killer.  If you liked previous COD games you should definitely pick this up but if you can wait it out and pick it up on sale I'd go with that route.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "More of the same just new maps really....", "unixReviewTime": 1289347200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2010"}

The game opens with Mason tied to a medical chair, surrounded with monitors with a non-descriptive disembodied voice asking him questions.  At the same time Mason keeps hearing and seeing a list of numbers.  It's unclear until about halfway through the game whether Mason has been captured and is being interrogated by an unknown enemy or if he is being questioned by a friendly force trying to extract life-saving data from him.  The game progresses through a series of flashbacks that show what Mason has been through and how he came to be in the chair he is in.  The flashbacks take the gamer from Cuba and the Bay of Pigs to Vietnam to a frozen wasteland near Russia and to beneath the ocean. The climax of the game leads up a climatic battle that loosely ties to actual history.The overall graphics in the game are spectacular.  There are many times that you look around and get the impression that you are playing a movie and not a video game.  At certain points in the game, the images are extremely lifelike.  The voice acting is strong and the music does an excellent job of accompanying what is happening during the story.I usually don't play multi-player levels, but BLACK OPS has a special multi-player/co-op mode where you can fight a zombie horde.  The \"Zombies\" mode is exciting and addictive.  I just wish there was an end point somewhere; the zombie hordes never stop invading.With that said, CALL OF DUTY: BLACK OPS is a disappointment.  The overall storyline is short and the \"reveal\" at the end is disappointing.  I mean, do we really need another Manchurian Candidate scenario?The way the game operates is frustrating, too.  BLACK OPS has been marketed as though it offers a more expansive and innovative gameplay, but that's just not the case.  You have to complete each objective a certain way, otherwise the game doesn't progress and you are killed.  The A.I. buddies that fight along your side don't do anything during actual combat and the blunt of the enemies attacks are always at your character.  If you try to hide and peak a shoulder or a toe out, you're dead in a few seconds.  There's no thinking outside of the box and if you try, you die.  During battle sequences, if you stay in one spot it doesn't matter how good of a shot you are or how many enemies you kill because they just keep coming and coming and coming.  The men at the Alamo had better odds than you do if you attempt to stay undercover and fight it out without advancing.Beyond that, I was also disappointed by how little you actually get to play in certain environments.  BLACK OPS was marketed as being a Cold War video game.  For example, despite the historical negative connotations of the actual historical war, the prospect of fighting in Vietnam as a secret covert agent is exciting.  You imagine all the possibilities of fighting and surviving in a jungle and think of a video-game version of Rambo. Instead, you are given a few sequences that have to be accomplished in a certain way and only about 25% of the game being spent fighting in Vietnam.  It's like playing a game in the American Civil War only to find out that for over half of the game you're neither going to be a Yank or Reb but will be playing a Native American in a completely different conflict between two warring tribes out in Montana.Overall, the graphics and voice acting are superb, but the storyline is weak and the gameplay is frustrating and non-innovative.  BLACK OPS looks fun from the outside, but when it sees the light of day, it's a disappointment.  The best thing about the game is the Zombie mode.  Kids will probably enjoy it, but those over 16 or anyone who is a more experienced gamer will probably be disappointed by it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Beyond Zombies, It's Disappointing.", "unixReviewTime": 1294358400, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2011"}

It's not perfect, but when compared to the earlier Treyarch releases it is much better and with luck will keep the series moving in a direction fans love.  I have this game for the PC and the XBox 360 and I've not only enjoyed both, I've been impressed with how well the graphics look on the XBox, given the huge differences in hardware:  gameplay appears to be a stable and smooth 60fps for me.What I love about the single-player campaign is that the story is intricate and contains some surprising twists to it--and what seals the deal is the history behind it.  The story is set during the Vietnam War and also touches on the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs incident.  There are a couple of things depicted in the game that aren't quite accurate, but it's been enjoyable getting details from Vietnam veterans I know (and from the Internet).  It's still a very plausible campaign and there is enough variety in each level and its goals that you don't feel like you're being handed a map and a paltry excuse to shoot it up from one end to the other.When it comes to multiplayer, I really enjoy the way it feels:  it's not just the fact that the technology is fairly accurate to the times, it's that even without Modern Warfare styled gadgets you can get a lot of tactical fun out of running and gunning across the maps.  We still have airdropped care packages and we still have the occasional ability to light up the map with a radar sweep that tags enemies with red dots.So the only thing really keeping Black Ops from a 5-star rating are some minor cons.  Like with every shooter, you'll have moments where your feet get stuck or you can't move because you can't see the treestump next to your ankle that's blocking you.  I've learned to forgive those moments because they happen in any game.  With Treyarch's \"World at War\" there were times that the enemies seemed to be willing to spawn forever if you didn't move to tag the appropriate hotspot on the map.  This happens a few times in Black Ops and it can lead to some real Groundhog Day style moments.  The other con that I'm hoping goes away is that there will be times a checkpoint triggers at the worst possible moment--and if you die, you respawn into a bad situation that may take you a dozen revives to get past.  I only had this happen a couple of times, but it left me thinking, \"You have GOT to be kidding me!\"  Frustrating, and sometimes it causes you to deliberately have to be foolhardy and rush in on a bad situation knowing you'll take a hit or two.  I'd rather push forward acting as if bullets are a bad thing that I can't just brush off by hiding for 10 seconds.  It can get silly when some of the enemy AI are foolish enough to step out in front of you or stand next to cover, but at higher difficulties this happens less.Overall, if you like the Call of Duty series, this is a great entry into new territory.  It's got an excellent storyline and the multiplayer on the XBox 360 is loads of fun.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "New Tales for an Old War", "unixReviewTime": 1355097600, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2012"}

As a master administrator you must hire workers and tax collectors to repair the homes and reconstitute the economy of each ravaged domain.  The game is broken up into multitudes of scenarios that must be completed in order to advance. What I like about this game is that it's very easy to control. You click on the screen where you want a house or a sawmill or market or whatever to be constructed and workers rush out and start building it.  You click on the bank to send your tax collectors to withdraw assets.  Every house you build earns money, every bank earns money.  You use that money to purchase resources, workers, statues, gardens, street lamps, etc.., in order to meet the goals of each scenario.The animation is wonderful, very fluid, little characters with hammers and saws build the structures, little tax collectors make bargains with market vendors, and the goals for each scenario are different.  For example, in one scenario the goal is to construct three fully upgraded villas and have the \"happiness\" level at 30. The next scenarios would have different goals. You increase happiness with finishing touches like gardens and lamp posts, and other trimmings.  A nice point is that there is no real time limit to finish each scenario, but there is a \"gold star\" time limit.  If you finish the scene within the gold star time..., before the timer runs out..., your points are boosted and you earn achievement trophies. but even if you don't finish it before the gold star time runs out you can still continue and finish the scene, and you will still get some points and a score simply for completing it. If you finish a scene but don't get a gold star, you can go back at any time and try it again. To me, a casual game should be casual.  It should be challenging to a degree but not make you work too hard to enjoy it, and this game qualifies in that respect. This game strikes the right balance.The ease of gameplay, the excellent animations, the relaxing music, and the feeling of accomplishment when you have completed each scene makes this a very entertaining game.

Watchman\"", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewText": "I played America's Army for over 10 years but it died when the U.S. Army decided to UPDATE it.  It had a following from ALL over the world. I even joined a clan and we had about 40 members with 10-12 of them from others countries like Belgium, Holland, Italy, etc.  I still play the older version 2.85 and still find 170 servers available for it (Sat. Dec. 4, 2011 there were 165 players playing). The newer version is 3.0 but it is so different it is NOT the same game, in fact it is more like a cheap version of CoD or BF.Some of the game play and even some of the sounds in ArmA II games are very similar to America's Army (referred to as AA, search \"AA Army\" and you will find downloads for both versions). I think that the developer for ArmA II probably helped develop America's Army. However, America's Army was fun and easy to play, and it was a simulator too but MUCH MORE intuitive than ArmA II is.One thing that made America's Army more realistic is there was NO single player mode, and you had to go to boot camp and COMPLETE IT before you could play. Another thing is that there was no re-spawning like in most games. You could call for help from a medic but if they did not get there quickly you would DIE. Even if they ministered first aid to you it might not be enough, depending on your wounds. Also, being treated by a medic did NOT restore you to 100% health like ArmA II does! You could bleed to death from your wounds (bleeding you could still play until you bled to death, which could be 1 minutes or five minutes. When you died you had to WAIT until the next round started, but you got to spectate your own team while you waited. Which could be very beneficial if you had some good players on your team, you could watch them in action and learn some good tips.As for ArmA II, it seems very similar and has great potential. However, the computer generated Opfor (AI) can see in the DARK, and see through walls, etc.!! Often I am crawling through the tall grass and an Opfor sees me 500-600 yards away and starts shooting at me, and getting a few hits on me too, and I CANNOT EVEN SEE HIM!! I understand it is ALL ABOUT how they setup the program to detect your location but COME ON how real is that? I thought that this was SUPPOSED to be a SIMULATOR? I am ex-military (4 years) and a retired cop, over 20 years on the force and even a swap sniper for 5 years.In the sniper mission, \"One Shot One Kill\", its dark or dusk and I cannot even get to the target. For one thing I only have 10 minutes and the target is like 2 miles away, it takes me almost 10 minutes to get there, running the whole way, which EXPOSES you to detection to patrol and the troops at the location you are SUPPOSED to sneak up on? I NEVER get to even see the guy I am supposed to shoot \"Spider\". When I get even CLOSE all of the Opfor see me and start to OPEN UP on me, even the armed vehicles!!IF before I get too close, I try to crawl the last 300 yards TIME RUNS OUT. Also my so-called SPOTTER is stupid! He is always shooting at EVERYONE, alerting the Opfor to our position. I know I can tell him STOP-NO SHOOTING but IF this is a simulator I should not have to. Like I said I WAS A SNIPER FOR FIVE YEARS. If I had a spotter like that, I would have him fired or I would shoot him myself.Another problem with almost ALL fps games is the lack of REAL physics, such as, if you are a sniper looking through your scope it is moving around like you just ran a marathon. Or after you have been running a SHORT distance they have you SLOW down and huffing and puffing after 20-30 seconds!!It is obvious the programers have had NO REAL experience and they are NOT getting good input from someone who does have that experience! A good, experienced sniper will NOT have that kind of scope movement, and IF the guy is a REAL experienced soldier, and especially if he is SPECIAL OPS he will be in TOP SHAPE, able to run long distances, WITHOUT getting tired for 2-3 or more minutes.I AM REALLY LOOKING for a \"REAL\" SIMULATOR (Spec.Ops and Sniper), that gets it RIGHT. Been playing almost EVERY fps for over 15 years now! Sniper: Ghost Warrior is one of the best for simulating a Sniper but it too needs some improvements.True there are LOTS of controls in ArmA II, IF you like to be a MICRO-MANAGER (control freak), but in REAL LIFE you actually DEPEND on your team having BRAINS enough to do some things WITHOUT you having to be TOLD EVERYTHING, like, \"Take cover\", \"Don't shoot\", when we are trying to SNEAK up on people! Or just the opposite \"SHOOT\" when they are being shot at!!  If I have told them to hold their fire, they won't shoot even when they are shot at. Ha Ha, I believe in FOLLOWING ORDERS but it is COMMON knowledge and practice, \"DEFEND YOURSELF\" in combat, and \"When fired upon RETURN FIRE.\"When I am offered a new mission I must press the numbers 0 then 8 > 2 > 2 > 1 to communicate that I ACCEPT the mission. I should be much simpler than that, like TWO numbers of like in AA, press a letter \"T\" and then a menu pops up with a selection of messages. Some lead to another set of messages, etc.TOO many controls, too convoluted, huge learning curve and the graphics that are NOT that impressive. I had to LAUGH at some of the YouTube reviews with titles likes, \"THE MOST REALISTIC GRAPHICS\"!  They are OK but not that great, and the movements are not very realistic either.AGAIN, I thought that this was supposed to be a SIMULATOR?I would give America's Army ver. 2.85 FOUR-FIVE STARS and America's Army ver. 3.0 TWO STARS. ArmA II THREE STARS but it would get more stars if the AI was not so bad and the graphics are JUST SO-SO! ArmA 3 is LOOKING GOOD though.I have NOT given up on ArmA games yet because I see it has, what appears to be, a large community, it has POTENTIAL, and it IS NOT a RUN n' GUN type of game, which I do play but I get TIRED of these 11 year old kids running amuck, and all of the CHEATERS.

Bateman", "helpful": [32, 33], "reviewText": "ARMA2 is a realistic military simulator, probably the most realistic on the market.  It's not just infantry combat, although you can play it that way.  ARMA2 also has cars, trucks, tanks, helicopters, planes, and more.  It even models ballistics and bullet drop, if someone fires at you from 200 meters away you even hear the bullet hit the ground before you hear the rifle.  It's a big sandbox, which is good and bad.The game ships with 2 islands, a large and a small.  Both have forests, hills, roads, towns, fields, mountains, etc.  I'd say you would spend a good 15 minutes driving from one side of the island to the other.  If you can see it you can go there, there are NO invisible walls.  The game locations are fictional, although they are based on real-life topography.  ARMA2 is set in Eastern Europe, Operation Arrowhead is set in the Middle East.  The possibilities on the huge playing areas are almost endless.  You can also download user-created islands, some of which are impressive in both scope and detail.A mission designer is included to make your own missions, along with sophisticated scripting capabilities.  In addition, there are hundreds of user-created mods and missions, everything from a simple \"destroy the enemy\" mission to new weapons, vehicles, sounds, etc, to new game modes like \"capture the island\" and a GTA clone.In a way there are almost too many possibilities between official and user-made content, and the quality varies.  The official missions have some neat tricks, although they don't expose you to everything the game has to offer.  Some things work well, others don't.  You'll have to find a way to manage missions/mods and all your time gathering, installing, and playing all the different things.  A launcher like \"ARMA II Launcher\" helps you manage what mods you want to use.  There is plenty of help on the official Bohemia Interactive forums, although they are picky about posting in the appropriate forums.Although the visuals and presentation are quite good, ARMA2 is quirky and not without bugs and oddities.  Just mapping the controls is an adventure, what's the difference between \"Prone\" and \"Go Prone?\"  You'll use practically every key on the keyboard, although remember you can map something like Control-G for landing gear or Control-E to eject.  With a large playing area and so much going on, performance is also an issue, ARMA2 benefits from tweaking and downloading mods to do things like get rid of motion blur and tame the tall grass a bit.There is plenty to do in this game for both single player and multiplayer.  Setting up local, LAN, or Internet games is smooth and easy.  It even remembers the last IP address you manually typed in (I'm looking at you OFP Dragon Rising!)  Co-op missions, deathmatch, capture the flag, and more are all there, and with mission designers being able to do scripting plenty of different game modes are out there.  There are \"Warfare\" or \"capture the island\" missions that add strategic and real-time-strategy elements as you build your base, build units and vehicles, and try to take over towns while searching for the enemy base.  You can choose to be a soldier and take orders, command a squad, or be in high command mode and command all the units.  The learning curve on Warfare modes is moderately high and documentation is scarce, but they are very unique and rewarding.If you have the time and patience and like realistic military combat simulators, ARMA2 will delight and amaze you.  If you're a run-and-gun sort of player with a short attention span, this probably isn't your game.  It also helps to be somewhat computer knowledgeable and have good hardware.  I have a 2.4 GHz dual core AMD, 4GB of RAM, Windows XP, and a GTX 250 video card.  With tweaking it runs acceptably on my system, but I wouldn't want to play with much less.

It was developed with many aspects similar to an actual military training program used by armies worldwide. Most notably, ARMA 2 is incredibly realistic with regards to things like ballistics, weapon range, and weapon damage. The usual FPS run-and-gun tactics won't cut it here - teamwork and quick thinking are a must to be successful in ARMA 2. Some relatively simple changes to the usual FPS framework make realistic tactics a necessity. For example, being shot at makes your aim less accurate - as such, the tactic of \"suppressing fire\" works in ARMA 2 when it does not work in most games. These tactics aren't too hard to learn, but gamers trained in traditional shooters will have to shift their thinking about how to win.ARMA 2 has an extensive single-player mode, featuring campaigns as well as individual scenarios, but the game's best aspects are found in multiplayer (whether cooperative or competitive). Players running around willy-nilly make easy prey for coordinated players who make good use of communication and tactics. The maps are huge to allow for vehicles, which also means that soldiers can engage at realistic ranges (from hundreds of meters away). This prevents the standard spray-and-pray mentality from gaining ground.The game features a robust editor for creating single-player or multiplayer scenarios. Some light scripting is required, but there are plenty of easy references on the internet for it. For the most part, the editor is intuitive and simple - place units, place waypoints, place triggers, and so on and so forth. The game is also fairly easily modded. A variety of expansions and DLC packs provide even more content - \"Operation Arrowhead\" is the biggest one and provides the most benefits, while the other ones are recommended only for people who are really interested in their niche subjects (like \"the Czech army\").The game's graphics aren't exactly great, but considering the scale of the game this isn't really surprising. They're certainly \"serviceable\" - not ugly, but just not up to the par of modern AAA games. The game's sound is a little weak, too, but unlike many games the sound serves a gameplay purpose. There is no \"useless\" background noise - every gunshot has an actual source on the map, and every spoken word communicates actual information about what allies (or enemies) are doing. Especially notable is the game's disjointed voice system, where characters will give orders and refer to objects or people in an \"assembled\" manner. For example, an AI commander may give an order to \"move\" \"right\" \"50 meters\", with each fragment being spoken separately. The overall effect sounds weird, but is useful for conveying information \"naturally\" rather than in a scripted manner.Overall, ARMA 2 is certainly a different experience than most games, and may frustrate gamers looking for a quick pick-up shooter, but the depth of play involved offers an incredibly distinct experience that shooter fans shouldn't easily dismiss.Rating: 9/10.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Depth of Play", "unixReviewTime": 1363219200, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2013"}

Those four movies alone have great soundtracks with a lot of fun songs to sing, yet they only had one song each?

That means, there was a lot of talking in the songs, which I didn't like either. I would have preferred to choose soundtrack or movie to sing with. In other words, I'd rather sing with Elton John, then the movie version of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\"The vocal exercises were extremely easy for an adult, but I suspect they might be useful to a young child, say around 5 years old.

The beginning of the game has all these tutorials and if you dont want that simply hit options and disable the tutorials. This was a big issue of frustration for me initially. There are also alot more features with designing the house and with it comes some new buttons to know how to operate which after learning them simply add to the individualizing accuracy of the game. There are still some new features I'm discovering. I really like being able to have and create multiple floors on the houses. The couples or single parent can also have either four or five children by adoption or by \"woo-hooing.\" The kids grow up from infants, to toddlers, children, teenagers and then become young adults. You can choose traits that go with them that they exhibit (example would be excitable which means they are easily excitable). For the adult starting characters they can grow well into graying senior citizens. Initially this caught me off guard and I did not realize you can disable the age feature in the options menu. So in one of my games I now have two gray haired elderly sims and their toddlers. The female sims also become comically pregnant in which they display morning sickness and later grow a belly. They also dramatically arch their backs backwards when walking. The reactions by your other sims when the mother sim gives birth is hilarious! There is now alot more individualizing of the sims character in how they look than there was before. However, one big problem I had was that you cannot not only buy empty lots (which isnt such a problem since you can simply delete the whole house by using the sledgehammer button) but if any of one of your sim characters move the rest all are erased from the game. If you move you can choose who to take with you but for the rest left behind they cannot come with you and are not to be found in the game after that. To me that became a big issue of irritation since when the kids move into young adulthood they cannot leave unless you want them to become deleted. I think they also shouldve added a bigger game booklet with more detail because alot of it I had to look up on the internet. The game seems to have more complex controls than before and a better instruction booklet wouldve been helpful. When I was perusing the online help guides apparently others are also similarly frustrated by the lack of information and detail. Also if youre like me and like to get a feel for the game before you learn all of what the controls do simply hit at the beginning of the game your start button and under options hit disable tutorials.

Sure, I know the ins and outs of it, how it plays and such, from watching someone else play it for hours on end (I bought it for them), but I've only done rudimentary stuff with it personally. I will say that what I played of the game is better then I remember the original Sims game being way back when, and very very much better then the original Sims port was for the PS2 when I had that. a game that swore me off console ports of Sims games. The fact that EA decided to simply port the entire game to the consoles, instead of just an objectives based half-port, is exciting to me.I'm also fairly surprised that they were able to map the buttons needed to play the game to a controller so well -they're a little convoluted, but they work.But, you might be asking, why don't I play it more then, if it excites you so much? Well, the answer to that is actually where the two stars I've knocked off come in.While watching the game be played one day, the person I bought it for and I decided to get something to eat and come back later. Okay, fair enough, save the game, turn off the console, go eat. Well, later when we came back to it and they loaded in their most current save -something you'd do with any game your playing. But when the save loaded the game became a choppy, corrupted mess. After closing the game and restarting the 360 multiple times, the game save itself was obviously corrupted.Obviously angry, we started a new game and built everything up over the next day or so. Next week, when we had more time to sit with it, the game was --again-- corrupted, pretty much everything lost to a horrible stutter-y mess.Now, we both knew that Sims games do this, its been a series staple to suddenly have your games get funky after so much work is done, usually in spite of your dedication. But you'd sort of figure that if your going to bring a game to the consoles, a game so well known to have bugs like this that its becomes a series wide joke, that a little more care would be taken to weed out the problems.. But, of course, that seemed to be asking a little much from The Sims and EA.Overall, if the game didn't corrupt on a irregular basis, for unknown reasons, I'd be playing it -and I still might on a separate 360 profile, so I don't net unwanted achievements on a game that I'll never be able to finish out. But the problems so bad that the person I bought it for isn't really even wanting to spend time with it any more, which kind of makes it feel like a waste of money.

There are limitations but it does not interfere too much with gameplay.I will list the new features and limitations and gameplay changes of the xbox 360 version of the sims 3.Pros: Since this is being played on a console, there is no need to worry about the usual performance issues that frequently plague pc users, the pc versions performance is iffy and unpredictable, but on the console version, there is no need to worry.Karma powers, challenges and rewards and achievements: One of the best features of this game. Karma powers let you do stuff like raise/lower all your sims needs, make them learn skills at an accelerated rate or make them super lucky for a couple of hours. You earn points at midnight and for completing wishes. As for the challenges, there are many, i think 300 challenges which will have you complete every aspect of the game and will extend your play time for many hours.pros/cons: These are a list of things that can be good or bad depending on how you look at it.Building limit \"fire code\": I personally am happy with the build limit overall, but there are a few things like how planting seeds take up a good amount of space on the meter, so making the perfect garden at your dream mansion you worked hard for may be hard to do. Also the most expensive pre-built mansion is not really a good choice if you want to customize, i would suggest the second most expensive mansion, there seems to be a less strict building limit and the design of the lot offers more space.Glitches: Though mostly bad, there are some neat glitches in this game, like how the repair man gives you a free $4,000 laptop after he comes to your house, but there are some game stopping glitches how the game thinks that there is a karma power active and does not let you save after 20 sim weeks of progress, or how items from your inventory disappear after moving to a new lot.cons:Right off the bat i will talk about slow fast-forward times. I thought it was slow in the pc version, but it is much worse in the console version. Occasionally the clock may jump forward faster when all sims are sleeping, but it is not much of an improvement and rarely happens. I spent the past 3 hours playing and waiting for my plants to grow. i have been waiting 90% and playing the other 10% of the time. I had time to watch a movie while occasionally unpausing the game or tending to my plants which brings me to my next issue.Almost every event that happens in the game will make your game pause, such as useless opportunities, when sims get job promotions or when those sims ask if they can talk on the phone. So not only does the game take forever to fast forward, you cant just leave the game running because eventually it will pause automatically.Because of the way the game is setup no two created families can interact with eachother, it is one family per save and you cannot modify, delete or add any community or neighborhood locations and you are stuck in one area that may have a park, and a couple of residents, so if you want to travel in another part of town, you must sit through a long loading screen, taking away the freedom to roam you had in the pc version.In conclusion, this game is fun to play to complete challenges and get achievements, but lacks the sandbox style gameplay in the pc version.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Limitations on the console version but the new challenge mode adds many hours of challenging gameplay.", "unixReviewTime": 1301788800, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2011"}

I played the first Sims and I loved it very much though I felt there were definite limitations to the console version.  Fast forward to the Sims 3, and it's definitely a much more fluid and fun experience than the first game that I played way back in the day.As someone mentioned here, it's fun to play God.  It's even more fun when I have the chance to create real life friends in the virtual world (they even look and act eerily like the real people I know) and see what kind of crazy awkward situations you can put them in (or watch them flourish in specific job situations and/or hobbies/talents).This game is like a black hole that sucks away any sense of time you may have in the real world.  On the first day, I sat through 11 straight hours without even batting an eyelash (other than to grab a quick bite or two and use the restroom).  That's how addictive this game is.  It's incredible that you can have so much control over everyone's lives, as well as how you make friends, interact with NPCs, and learn skills that really define who your Sims are over the course of their lifetimes.  I also like how there is so much attention to detail in terms of how you can design and build the home of your dreams.  You can landscape, paint, wallpaper, roof to your heart's content, and buy all sorts of cool stuff to put in the house.I have heard about the glitch involving people who have game freezes due to possibly too many objects in their inventory or game (I have yet to encounter this problem, fingers crossed) - however, I'm just being very careful about how I manage my stuff in game and am hoping that the problem doesn't affect me.The game controls fabulously.  There is definitely a bit of a learning curve at first when you pick up the game.  But once you figure it out thanks to some helpful tutorials, it will all make sense and feel like second nature to you.  I do notice that there is a slight lag when it comes to load screens in game (and there are a lot of them) but for the most part it didn't distract me that much.  I was too busy in my little sandbox, watching my Sims move up in life (and watching my kid grow up).  Throw in some intrigue (such as one of my housemates bringing her lesbian lover home for some \"woo hoo\"), a little karma here and there (which is one great addition to the game - it really makes it fun when you can use 'powers' to create dramatic situations) and you have the recipe for an amazing game that will suck the very life out of you.My challenge now is to not ditch my real life friends because their Sim counterparts are just that much more interesting lol!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My real life is over, thanks to this game", "unixReviewTime": 1295827200, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2011"}

(I should note, I previously played The Sims 2 on Playstation 2.)THE PROS:- Much more detail in creating a Sim, although the body details haven't really improved much.- MUCH more social interactions. Of course, this would be a given.- Multi-story homes have now been introduced in the console versions of the game. As well as kids and teenagers.- You now have a whole town to explore and aren't just stuck on your lot or at home, anymore.- New career choices.- You can control what goes on at work (or school) given options. You can make a Sim work hard or slack off, talk to co-workers, suck up to the boss, etc. (You just can't actually DO any work yourself, though.)- Brand new types of objects, such as Cars, Kids Toys, and other things.- The console-version-exclusive Karma Powers, which are basically in-game 'cheats' that let you do things like fill all Needs, do better at work, or temporally become really lucky.THE CONS:- NO MORE DIRECT CONTROL MODE!!! I can't tell you how much I miss this! I personally hated the 'multi-tasking point & click' mode of The Sims 2 console. This IS a console game, so why no Direct Control? This is especially annoying when I'm at the Library and my Sim grabs a book and automatically sits down at some random spot I don't want to go at (usually in a crowded section around other Sims) because I can't control them!- You no longer can tell what level you are in a social relationship, anymore. There are no more Social Points in the game and now, you just have to guess where you are in a relationship and how close you are to becoming a friend or Best Friend. It's real annoying.- You can no longer edit your Sims personality anymore. Sure, you can give them 'ability traits' that sort of substitute the old personality stats, like Friendly makes a Sim very outgoing, Good makes a Sim want to help people and cheer them up, Ambitious makes a sim learn skills quicker and want to get promotions faster, and Good Sense of Humor makes a sim funny. They're okay, but I miss the old way. I wish they could've included both personality systems.- No Story Mode (from The Sims 2 console version) as well as no 'Sandbox' mode, either. The game is just a free-roam mode with no storyline objectives and no full sandbox creativity.- You almost ALWAYS start out with the same amount of money (20,000) when making a new Sim, and will ALWAYS have only two choices of homes to move into, even though like, six are available. You can't move into them because you can't afford them. So why even offer them there?- Less variety of home objects to buy.- The Career choices are still limited. No being an Actor or Firefighter or Superhero. Although the expansion packs on the PC have somewhat fixed this with the introduction of new jobs, those aren't available for the consoles (though they should've been).- BIG Con! The game may crash on you, depending on any number of unforseen things you might've done, such as building/filling your house too close to the Fire Code, moving into a new house, or just glitches, etc. The game might freeze/crash, not save or load, etc.COULD BE EITHER PRO OR CON:- The game is just way too easy, overall. Karma Powers aside, some things are just too convient. Yeah, I *do* like that I can use the Moodlet Manager to wake a sleepy Sim up seeing as they seem to ALWAYS be drowsy, and even with a good bed, can't stay awake for longer than 16 hours a day. But the Lifetime Rewards points, Skill Milestones, etc. just make the overall experience too easy. There's no challenge in anything, really. It's almost impossible to not get promoted in any given job. All you have to do is show up. It'll just take longer to get promoted than it would if you were trying. Epic Fail seems to be the only way you can not do well in any full-time job. That's kinda why, even with all the perks, I don't like this game as much as Sims 2, as Sims 2 was more challenging, which made it more fun.Overall, it's a good game, but it's just not as 'fun' as The Sims 2 was. There's no Story Mode or Sandbox Mode here, which means no challenging story objectives and no ability to do whatever you want (without cheats). Also, some of the bugs and glitches actually ruin a lot of things, as well. I love the game, but I've actually gotten used to saving back-up files for my four families in case something happens. So far, I've only had to use one back-up to restore things from a corrupted save file, but still. These kinds of things shouldn't happen for something your paying hard-earned money for!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A good game, but not as fun as The Sims 2", "unixReviewTime": 1303689600, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2011"}

First there are no seamless neighborhoods as there are in the Windows versions.  That is a drag as you have to watch loading screen after loading screen appear.  While the game is fun to play the loading time is ridiculous long.  Maybe there is something wrong with my XBox but I just finished playing Mass Effect 2 repeatedly and had no problem with it and there was no load time for hardly anything in that game.  My real gripe is, and this is the one that is sucking the life out of this game for me, is that when saving the game I have repeatedly encounter failure after failure.  Even when the save is working it takes up to twenty seconds or more for the game to save.  Again, I have not had this problem with any of the other games I have played recently.  The closest is Mass Effect but as that is an older game that might be expected but even that game saved correctly.  It certainly was not the case with Mass Effect 2, or Assassin Creed 2 or even Rumble Rose, an older game I still like to play.  All of those game save quickly and as they should.  I would like to like this game.  It has some neat features on it such as the house building tool but, alas, even that has limits on the amount of stuff you can buy.  My two musicians got so rich they were able to build three houses and remodel a 4th  and each time Johnny Storm appeared preventing even more decorations or remodeling.  What is the point of having so much money if you can't spend a little bit of it?  There are some other aspect of this game that I dislike.  The time of the day goes by too fast.  By the time you eat a sandwich, go to work, go to that potty, go to shower, it is another day so that leaves hardly anytime of socialization unless you use karma powers which you have to unlock.  I had to turn the aging thing off as it is also a fun sucker since every 17 Sims day your character ages up.  I was really annoyed to find that by the time one of my Sims became a Rock Star she turned into an cripple stereotypical old lady chewing her gum and her green hair white.  That sucked royally.  Mind you I don't object to the aging feature, it is that the character aged so quickly and turned on the eve of her success so she did not get to reap the benefits of all her hard work playing on street corners and working in the music hall.  Sorry to say but this game just doesn't cut it for me because of the tediousness of loading screens and the failure to save properly making you replay things you have already achieved.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "really long loading screens and repeated failures of Save suck the life out of it.", "unixReviewTime": 1290816000, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2010"}

Each installment improve the quality of the game overall but the PC users got more of the cake than the consoles consumers. After the sims 2 came out on the xbox and playstation 2, i had high hopes for the series itself since it was a huge improvement from the original sims. Finally after years of waiting, we finally have The Sims 3 introduce to our next gen consoles. Was the years worth the wait? Find out with this brutally honest review of The Sims 3.In the original sims, you started at your mom's house where all you did was loafing around doing nothing while your sim mother was up and about doing her business. In the sims 2, you started off with roommates. Now in the sims 3, you dont have a mom around you nagging to fix the tv or get a job (sounding like somepeople life) or roommtes right away. You have the option as always to make a family of your dreams. Where exactly? A place call Moonlight bay where dreams can either come true or utterly draw back on you. In the Sims 3, there is no story mode. It's more of a free mode. I'll explain it...If you want to create your very own family, you have the option to have your sims to a toddler to being an elder. The clothing is update and you have the option to create your own style and upload to the EA server which has a sim store where other players upload sims, houses, styles, etc. You can customize your sim's face, pick his personality traits, a dream wish (have up to six kids, become a spy etc). You can have up to six people in a family. Note: if you want to start as a toddler, consister having a young adult in your family since you need someone to take care of the toddler sim. If you do a great job of raising the toddler, you will receive benefits (a extra trait for your sims personality). Do a bad job of raising your child and you will receive negative traits. Also if you can careless about your child, child services will come to your house and take the baby away (sounds like today somewhat). After your done making your family, you have the option to buy a house furnish or unfunish. Depending on your income, you can choose to buy one of two houses they provide for you.When you first start off, it will be extremely difficult. Money will be an essential since you have to pay bills. You have the option to have a full-time job or a part-time job to your pleasure. A range of jobs include, police officer, journalism, medical, military, etc.When you first start off, you'll notice on the top right of the screen that you will see boxes that are call wishes. These wishes are your sim wishes that want to be fulfill. You can either accept them or deny them if you want. An example of a wish is your sim wishes to workout and completing that you will get 300 lifetime points which are points that you can buy to have your sim have the option to slack during work and still get paid, fast cleaner, etc. The more wishes you complete, the more lifetime points you get and to unlock hidden items.The old school sim controls are back. They took out the sims 2 movement where you dont have the large yellow or green light as your cursor. The green light is back. A minor drawback since the controls for sims 2 were great. I was disappointed that they didnt have the option to have the controls for the sims 2 in the game. Now for the karma powers, they are new to the game. You have your good karma and your bad karma. Some of the good karma includes, being smart for a couple of hours and learning skills easily, take out all negative moddlets, being lucky for a couple of hours etc. The more you use them, the more chances you have to have a negative karma happening. Think of it as balancing the game. The bad karma includes firestorm (where fire shoots down from the sky causing your house to burn down), epic fail (where your sim or sims in the town will have bad luck for awhile).OverallPros- Can have mulitple levels in your house- The new wish system keeps the game intertaining- Numerous ways of creating your sim- Clothing options has expanded- Have the option to move out of your house- New challenges that will keep you busy.- The StoreCons- Loading screen takes forever- No two players- No online mode", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Sims 3", "unixReviewTime": 1308700800, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2011"}

I don't even like chess. The thought came from spending the previous evening trying to get both of my SIMS to sit down and play the game. It was not SIM abuse. It was something they both repeatedly indicated they wanted to do. I was granting a wish. I got points. But, I have to say the emotional gratification of the PC game was completely lacking. By the time I got one to sit down and managed to guide the other even near the table, the first one got up from boredom, ignoring their beloved spouse completely. In the end I was even willing to hop into the game to try my hand at chess...if only I could. This game leaves the owner with way more unfullfilled wishes than the SIMS.In the PC game Sims celebrate getting what they ask for and go over to it by themselves. You feel a certain goodness and a sense of gratification and accomplishment at making them happy. The Wii Sims are indifferent, ungrateful, and self-absorbed to the point of Narcissism. To make matters worse they are nearly impossible to move with the Wii remote when they are sitting down.  As someone else noted, the navigation issues are so bad that they can starve to death on the couch, refusing to even walk to the fridge, much less catch their ride to work. Taking them to work physically doesn't usually help either because timing is everything and \"work\" doesn't always appear in the alternatives you get to choose from when you get them there. Of course, if you could control them well enough to do things in a timely manner, you wouldn't have to teleport them to work!Another travel related issue is that with so many places to go you find yourself following your Sims as they wander, apparently aimlessly often returning to a place that offers no choices they seem to like. The flip side of this sullen determination to have their own way is a refusal to do simple things like come out of the rain or stay out of it in the first place.Since the game does not supply a therapist for either of us, I'm ready to abandon my relationship to these SIMS. I didn't give up on them easily!!! I'm a really nice person and, finding no \"trouble shooting\" section in the manual, I went over to the EA site, clicked on SUPPORT and put Wii in the search blank. I got exactly one entry back. It read, \"Why can't I finish buying this house in The Sims 3 on the Wii?\" The question referred to the purchase of a $50K house. The answer was you couldn't have it and needed to back out the request. Unless EA improves the controls, my Sims will never live long enough to save up for that $50K house. I find that very sad.

First off, the  game is loud when running. It groans and clicks as the disc spins inside the Wii. I assumed the game is double layered, and some Wiis have trouble reading double layered discs, but I recently upgraded to Wii U and got the same amount of noise. Second, it is a glitch party. The AI is horrible, your Sims will not do anything on their own. They require constant watch just to make sure they get through their morning routine. Sometimes it is amusing. Other times it is depressing. The bad AI also goes along with slow processing. The game frequently pauses to load, whether it be to render the house or to display a menu. This is very annoying when you are just trying to get your Sim to go use the toilet. First, the house has to load (if not already loaded). This takes 10-20 seconds. Then, you have to cancel whatever action your Sim is doing (this takes around 5-10 seconds). Then you have to point at the toilet, tell your Sim to use it, and wait about half a minute for all of the animations to load (sorry if this sounds disgusting). People don't mention what their Sims do, but I will give a perfect picture of every major glitch I've encountered:- My Sim child went to school each day and came home with, at best, a D+- The toilet caught fire and my Sim used it anyway- The Sim family tree messed up and the kids ended up being the parents- One of my Sims went to the gym and plopped dead- The Sims use the toilet, but don't flush it- One of my Sims was invisible- One of my Sims started to cook breakfast but left the stove on and started a fire- During one of the common house fires, a Sim walked into the burning room, caught fire, and froze for five minutes before just vanishing.Those are the major glitches that I remember off the top of my head. I've seen thousands of other bugs, but this gives a clear picture of just how bad the game is. Don't buy it, you'll regret it.

It's a little late for a review, but I figured why not? I've primarily played Sims on console, but I have watched LPs of the PC version on YouTube. This is basically the PC base game on console.Graphics 4/5 :Fairly good. Pretty and well-designed, but had the potential to be slightly better. Pretty close to the PC medium-high graphics.Gameplay 5/5 :The upgrades are amazing, especially if you're coming from the PS2 (or Xbox, GameCube, etc) installments of Sims. I must admit when I first entered Create-a-Sim I was a bit overwhelmed with all the customization options. It took me hours to create my sims, which isn't unusual (I'm a perfectionist and I pay attention to nearly every detail of my sims from head to toe). You can change the color, pattern, and style of all the clothing and there's a new hair color system to get a truly unique look. The new personality traits are amazing too. You can actually make your sim an individual since &#65279;there's endless combinations. (:After actually entering the game, I immediately opened build/buy mode to see the improvements. You now have the option to build muli-level homes (*does happy dance*) up to 5 levels with foundations with more detailed interiors that make your sims houses look more realistic. You can customize the color and pattern virtually everything; the floors, walls, furniture, etc. The fire bar is still present, and does limit your ability to create extremely large homes with a ton of furnishings. You can make a medium-large house/mansion and furnish it comfortably though. You also can have your personal cars for your sims.The addition of karma powers to the game puts a new twist on being the \"God\" of your only little 3D world. You can cause earthquakes, solar flares, bring dead sims back to life, make sims beautiful (or not so beautiful), bottom out all their needs (Hunger, Bladder, Energy, etc) and more.Your sims also age now. There's babies, toddlers, kids, young, adults, and then elders.. then you die! And become a ghost, or disappear into the underworld forever. (Mwahaha!) If aging isn't for you, you can turn it off and age your sims up when you feel like it or slow it down. Female sims also can become pregnant (with the possibility of twins and triplets) and go through morning sickness, weight gain, etc.  Very cute.Re-playabilty 5/5:If you're a hardcore simmer like me, this game will have you playing for hours on end with out even realizing it. Before you know it you'll be putting off everyday tasks and staying up all night just to play. Just a fair warning.Overall this is a very robust console version of Sims.

I've been playing the Sims for years and have loved everything Sims that EA has put out. The Sims 3 for DS is horrible, and I am so disappointed that I paid full price for it I could cry. I wouldn't even pay half price for this game, it's that bad.I agree with a previous reviewer who said The Sims 3 DS tries to be too much like The Sims 3 for PC. It is very much a dumbed down version, keeping the basics of the Sims 3 such as building skills, earning reward points, completing missions, etc... but it is so limiting being on the DS that there's no fun in it. The graphics are so poor you can't really see what your sim is doing, whether they're painting a picture or cooking a meal, you have to watch from a very limited angle above and use your imagination. And the waiting is absolutely agonizing. There's a fast forward button, but it doesn't speed it up that much. When my sim goes to work it still takes 7 real-time minutes, even in fast forward, for my sim to emerge and be able to go on to the next task. So you're left to sit and watch your sim's work building or get up and do something else during the that time. And who wants to get up and find something else to do for 7 minutes when they're in the mood to play video games?One thing that I've loved about the Sims for consoles in the past, such as Bustin' Out, the Urbz, and even the Sims 2 for DS, is that they are not like the PC versions, rather they have a beginning and an end and are filled with quests that help you progress to the end of the game. When I saw they made a Sims 3 for DS I was hoping it would follow in its predecessors footsteps. But it is evident that they were simply trying to provide a hand-held version of the PC game, and it is a huge FAIL in my opinion. At least I now know that if the Sims 3 for Wii is anything like this to not even bother, because obviously nothing will ever be as good as the PC version.I saw the negative ratings before I bought this game, but my love for the Sims got the best of me.

It just randomly shows it from time to time, but as far as I can tell there's no way to request that info.My biggest complaint, though, is the clock. Even on the fastest setting, the in-game clock moves about 1 minute per second. That means it can be pretty boring to wait while your sim is sleeping or working.I'm glad I rented this.

This will not relate to the PC version because I never played Sims 3 PC. This review is for the DS version.I got this game on release day, and I like it a lot. The only part I felt fooled on was that there aren't as many items and options for appearance that I thought there would be. However, there are still quite a few things to choose from. So it was enough to keep me satisfied.Starting the game, there are 3 available save slots. Kinda nice if you share with anyone or want more than 1 game going. It allowed me to play with 1 Sim, however, I can ask others to be a house mate. You set a lifetime achievement goal, a few characteristics about your sim, and then get to choose you house. Choosing a house has 3 options for purchase, you can have it just be land, a unfurnished house, or a furnished house. I chose unfurnished house, but it still came with appliances, a toilet and shower. Like any sim game, you still need to keep your sim in the green, aka happy. You can go places, but there are some buildings you cannot go inside, like work. When you get a job, it travels to your sims work, and you can change what theyre doing there. Like chat with co-workers, suck up to the boss, business as usual, etc. This helps me the most when my social meter is down, i chat the whole day. The downfall to following them to work, is that the fast forwarding thru time, even on the fast meter, is just still too slow. But it will tell you that if you got a house mate and that should keep you busy. I personally have not done that yet. Many places you can travel and go inside, like the gym, library, art gallery, you can also travel to the park, the beach, the cemetery, etc.All the while of keeping your sim happy you earn these lifetime happiness points. You can use these to buy special lifetime rewards. These are the Lifetime Happiness Rewards. Discount Diner (Free meals eating out), Speedy Cleaner (clean your house twice as fast as before), Complimentary Entertainment (Get into events free of charge), Professional Slacker (Watch TV & slack off at work without your boss caring), Observant (discover traits of others twice as quickly), Office Hero (Talking to Co-Workers will be more effective, they will love you), Opportunistic (Earn greater rewards and bonuses for finishing opportunities), Steel Bladder (Peeing is for sims with lesser wills), Bookshop Bargainer (Huge discount on books), Multi-Tasker (Become better at your job without any additional effort), Attractive (People will like you more), Haggler (Store clerks will throw discounts at your feet), Never Dull (Sims love listening to you talk and will never get bored when you repeat social interactions), Fast Learner (Learn and improve skills faster), Vacationer (Feel free to take the occasional day off, Nobody at work will notice), Dirt Defiant (Personal hygiene concerns rarely trouble the Dirt Defiant), Mid Life Crisis (Pick new traits & a new lifetime wish), Long Distance Friend (Friends never grow distant), Hardly Hungry (Hardly ever feel hungry and thirsty), Extra Creative (Create the finest paintings), Lap of Luxury (With your pockets doubled it's time to enjoy life in the luxury!).As far as friends, you can call then on the phone to chat or visit with them.Opportunities will appear occasionally, you will be given an opportunity and a time frame to complete it. If you complete these you typically earn a cash bonus, and sometimes it helps you to get a promotion at work.You get days off work now, typically. I don't remember having days off when I played older versions of Sims, but it seems nice to get days off.You get to go fishing, you can catch several different types and sizes of fish, and you have the option to put (most of) them in the fridge, or sell them for some extra cash. You can use them to cook with.As for cooking, you need to know recipies to make different types of foods. You can buy them at the library by reading a book about them.Skill books are all available at the library. You can purchase a book case as well but it seems the library has more options. There are several different types of cooking books that way you can learn different recipies, there are different fishing books to learn to catch different types of fish.You have the option to turn off free will if you like.Wishes will pop on the bottom right corner. You have the option to accept or deny them. You can keep two at a time. For instance, you may choose to accept a workout routine, upon completion you will receive a bonus of 250 lifetime happiness points. If a new one pops up and you already have 2, you have the option to delete one and add that one in.I tend to always repair things on my own. Well now its paying off more than before. Repairing you own things gives you more options for example, you will later be given the option to upgrade appliances, upgrade your sinks and tub to self cleaning, upgrade things to be unbreakable. These are great features!As for building, it gives you the option to build your home but I have not done this yet. So I cant say for sure the ease of it. I can update later how that goes, but the options look the same as previous sims game.Karma Powers, I've been playing for nearly 30 days (in the game time) and I just realized hey, where are these karma powers they kept talking about? So I got out the manual, and it says you need to find them. When i went most places, I wasn't zoomed in too far. Well, I started zooming in to look for these \"strange things\" and I have only found 1 so far. The karma powers are all locked, achieving higher Lifetime Happiness points seems to be what unlocks them. However, then you have to find them. You can go into a menu and see which ones are unlocked and it will give a hint as to where to find them. Like I said, I've only found one and it was Super Satisfy. So when I found it, it maxed all my meters to green. It tells me to go back to the place I found it to activate it. But haven't used these too much yet. I may update later with more info on these.All in all, its definitely the best Sims game that has come out for the hand held. Previous hand held sims games really didn't give you any options and you were pretty mission based. This one is pretty much free stylin'. I love it. I think its a must have for the hand held. And being rated Everyone, there will be no woo-hooing, so the kiddo's can play it with your mind at ease!!! You will be able to kiss another sim but I believe thats as far as it goes.Enjoy!!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I have put many hours into this game, and still plenty left to go.", "unixReviewTime": 1288396800, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2010"}

The defacto capitalist board game has been a staple of American households for 75 years.  In my lifetime, I've probably bought this game about 6 different times in several different variations.Monopoly Streets is a nice addition to the franchise.  It makes it considerably more fun and slightly less tedious than actually using the physical board game.  Where it shines is as a multiplayer game.  Where it fails is as a single player experience.The game allows for custom rules which are always a good thing.  There are several pre-made rule sets, but I've always been a fan of the Free Parking payday.  Thankfully you can make this and many other modifications to make the game more interesting or just run faster.  Though it's worth noting that despite this, Monopoly is still a lengthy game.  I personally haven't tried the fast game variants, but unless you have at least an hour to burn, don't bother starting this one up.One thing that I find really disturbing, which is more of a trend in the game industry is the micro transactions needed to unlock additional game content.  By this I mean it's becoming commonplace to sell the consumer half a game and expect them to spend real money through the online marketplace to get the rest of the game.  While playing the game you earn some monopoly credits which can be used to unlock some tokens and game boards.  But the best ones are not so easily unlocked.  You will literally have to pay real money to play on some boards or buy specific tokens like the cannon or the horse.  The most expensive real money item is a board called Stratosphere City.  It costs 560 Microsoft points which is about $8.  By the time you buy all the downloadable content (DLC), you will have almost paid $60 for this $40 game.  While this is a trend in the industry, I have noticed it more in EA products, which is who made this version of Monopoly.The game comes with 2 Monopoly \"Street\" game boards.  Moving around these boards is really neat.  You can watch friend and local avatars walking around these boards which make it more interesting.  When you buy property or build on property you see various animations depicting your purchase which definitely makes this game more appealing than the standard board game.  The financial progress of the players is tracked by corporate headquarters located in the center of the map.  The more total worth you have, the taller your headquarters becomes.  That's an interesting way of keeping track of how much you're beating the other players by.  However, if you turn off the move animations, it seems to disable viewing the HQ's grow or shrink.  If you want to get through the game faster, turning off those animations will definitely speed things up a bit.  You can unlock one additional \"Street\" style board (previously mentioned), and that's all there is for interactive boards.  All others are just bland flat cardboard style boards with varying themes.  Given the nature of this game, I wish they would have made every board style into an interactive Monopoly \"Street\" game board.  At this time, the game isn't more than about 2-3 months old.  So perhaps they intend on releasing more \"Street\" boards into the marketplace.  But you know they won't be free.As a human to human game experience this is a very fun game.  Don't bother playing single player.  The AI is vicious, even on easy.  I played an easy AI yesterday and it took close to 200 moves to win.  Basically the game cheats terribly.  I know that might sound like I'm a sore loser, but I assure you, I am not a pushover when it comes to Monopoly.  The reason why I accuse the game of cheating is that I would acquire every property on a side, do a full build, and it would take that AI about 8-10 times around the board before landing on those properties.  Statistically they always have a 50% of landing on that property, and yet they conveniently missed them time after time.  This really takes the fun out of the game.  I wish there were a means to force game honesty by using real dice and entering those values into the game.  It would add steps to a game, but it would most likely make the game shorter since it wouldn't conveniently be missing specific properties.  It's worth noting that the AI I played last night was so hard to take down, I kept having to build my wealth, then buy properties from that AI at obscene prices, then build the properties all the way up.  Even as I began to acquire all the properties it still seemed unreasonable how often the player missed landing on those properties.  And as if to prove my point that the game managed to inexplicably avoid these hazards, I was not able to eventually win until I had actually bought every single property in the game and build every single hotel that the bank had to offer.  I am truly terrified to find out how hardcore the medium and hard AI's are.  Basically, don't bother.  Just play real people locally and online.Something to consider, the characters the game offers are very annoying and repetitive in their dialogue.  I had several moments where I struggled to resist the urge to throw my controller at my TV.  You can turn off voiceovers, and I highly recommend that.  It's the only way to save your sanity.Ending thoughts.  I'd give it 7 out of 10.  It's still Monopoly, and that's always fun.  It's nice to have a computer quickly perform transactions which would otherwise involve handling physical Monopoly money, and depending on your game rules, a calculator.  Avoid playing the computer players unless you're a masochist.  It's worth $40, but I doubt I'll spend any more money to unlock boards and tokens which should have been included in the game.[EDIT]  I did buy the Stratosphere City map, and I don't recommend it.  The cars on that map make the Jetson car sound, and it becomes maddening in a very short time.  Turning down the sound effects helps, but also hinders audio you'd prefer to hear.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fun as long as you don't play the computer.", "unixReviewTime": 1293494400, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2010"}

Until then...UPDATE #2: EA has released another DLC item, a 3D \"CITY\" board called Stratosphere City for 560 MS Points. It's a futuristic city with hover cars. It has custom names for the properties and cards, unlike the prevoius DLC Championship board. Please Note: this is a \"CITY\" board so it has the buildings that are constructed as your build houses and hotels, etc etc...UPDATE #1: EA just released some DLC for this game. The board is 240 MS Points and the tokens are 80 MS Points each.Championship Board (Las Vegas 2009 Monopoly Championship theme). This board uses an official Monopoly game board since it's a recreation of the 2009 Monopoly tournament championship. There are NO custom names for the properties, community chest or chance cards.Horse and Rider (Male Jockey) tokenCannon (Army Guy) tokenRocking Horse (Female Equestrian) tokenPLEASE NOTE: This DLC is NOT DRM's locked so it can be shared amongst other gamer profiles (gamertags) on the same or different Xbox 360 consoles.Please Note: This review pertains to the Xbox 360 version of the game. Not all features / issues may be present across all platforms.Finally, a video game console version of Monopoly that has an Online Multiplayer component.I previously purchased Monopoly Party back when it was originally released on the original Xbox console and the more recent Monopoly video game for the Xbox 360 which was released just a couple of years ago. Both were good games, but they lacked an Xbox Live Multiplayer option so you were stuck play locally with friends/family and/or against the BOTs.The two included 3D \"city\" boards for Monopoly Streets are great and add something new to the Monopoly franchise. The rest of the boards are 3D but don't have the \"city\" buidlings aspect. The surrounding envirnments are fun as are the custom names for all the properties. For the \"city\" boards, as you buy properties and build houses and hotels your property comes alives with 3D scenery, houses and hotels. Every player also has a skyscraper which represents their total worth and the height of the skyscraper increases/descreases during gameplay. You only get two of these \"city\" boards one of which has to be purchased. Apparently, there is another featured in a gameplay trailer and will be probably be available as DLC as EA has stated this game will feature DLC for characters (tokens) and boards.All tokens and boards are compatible with every rule set and gametype options so you can mix things up and even use your own Xbox 360 Avatar as a playable character for use with any of the tokens. For Xbox 360 Avatar; props, pets, hats and costumes will NOT show up in game. Avatar shirts, pants, shoes, glasses, watches, and rings will show up on your character in game.Provided Rule Sets: Official MONOPOLY, Speed Die, Short Game, Bull Market, Jackpot, Fast Deal, Custom. All rule sets can be edited to create your own gametype with a variety of options to choose from to make your own House rules. You can also ssave a custom rule set for use in the future.Xbox Live Gametypes: Quick Match, Create Custom Match, Join Custom Match, Create Ranked Match, Join Ranked Match. Online Ranked matches  cannot be started with BOTS (computer) but if a NON connection HOST player quits before going bankrupt they will be replaced by a BOT (computer). You can play with up to four people locally on the same Xbox 360.The Monopoly Store is a nice touch and adds to the replay value as you try to earn Monopoly money to unlock additional content. Winners of a game gain just under 10,000 M and even the losers get some money, so if you are good you'll be rolling in the Monopoly money to unlock additional content.Unlockables in the Monopoly Store:M = Monopoly Money used to buy items in the Monopoly StoreAvailable Tokens and their (Characters):Top Hat (Magical Kid) - UNLOCKED at startShoe (Little Girl) - UNLOCKED at startMoneybag (Burglar) - M 15,000Car (Race car driver) - UNLOCKED at startWheelbarrow (Farmer) - UNLOCKED at startDog (Dog walker) - UNLOCKED at startCop Hat (Officer) - M 20,000Battleship (Admiral) - UNLOCKED at startIron (Maid) - M 10,000Available Boards:MONOPOLY City (3D board) - UNLOCKED at startCheese Board - M 6,000Cardboard Board - M 7,000Landmark City (3D board) - M 25,000Classic Board - UNLOCKED at startJungle Board - M 9,000Sweet Board - M 10,000Plaza Board - M 5,000Ice Board - M 8,000Overall it's a good game, and probably the best console based Monopoly game to date, at least on the Xbox/Xbox 360 but it does have several issues that need to be fixed/patched.Issues / Problems / Bugs:1. If the connection HOST (person who starts a game) quits during an Online match (ranked or custom) the game will END for everyone in the game and NOBODY will get any credit for the game. That means nobody is declared a winner, nobody gets any Monopoly money for use in the Monpoly Store, and the stats don't update for whatever you did in the game.The reason this happens is that there is NO Host Migration in the game, so if the HOST quits the whole game ends.WARNING: If the connection HOST chooses to declare BANKRUPTY or goes BANKRUPT they \"have to spectate\" for the rest of the game and stay in the game until a winner is announsed by Mr Moneybags and wait for the game to automatically send everyone back to the Main Menu.It is STRONGLY ADVISED that you HOST your own Online Matches and/or play with people who know about this issue otherwise, you'll more than likely end up with a connection HOST who QUITS not knowing that this ends the game for everybody. However, it is apparent that you don't necessarily become Connection Host even if you are the one to start/initiate the game.This is also something that could be EXPLOITED by someone choosing to QUIT instead of having a loss show up on the leaderboards and their profile stats. Aside from doing this to GRIEF (annoy) people online.2. Duing an Online match a human can go into the \"Morgage and Build\" menu, wait out the 60 second time, go back into it, rinse, repeat. Thus have a neverending turn in an attempt to GRIEF and make the other human player quit the game, for a win.3. A BOT (computer) or human player's character can spin around in get put int he wrong direction and then get stuck on and/or fall off the game board and be unable to complete their turn. Thus making it immpossible for anyone else to take their turn. The game will never end and everyone will have to QUIT the game.4. During the initial rolling of the dice to see who goes first, the dice will keep spinning or freeze and no one else will be able to take their spin and/or start the game.Enjoy!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best console Monopoly video game so far BUT there are problems", "unixReviewTime": 1290729600, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2010"}

Exactly what he said happens to me consistently.  Not only that, but if you have all of the property with all the houses maxed out, the computer will keep landing in jail and stay there for the full sentence then come out and land on Community Chest, then Chance right after that.  Also, if you own too many pieces of property (i.e., a piece of every color) you will suddenly begin to consistently land on luxury and income tax and jail.  It's so frustrating and so obviously cheating.  However, I've found the most efficient way to enjoy the game and make the cheating irrelevant.Step 1: Change the rules to allow only 1 turn in jail, and up the bail to $100Step 2: Change the Free Parking rules to pay out all the fees that are collectedStep 3: Change Go to payout 300Step 4: Buy 1 of every color.  DO NOT allow the computer to have more than 1 color, if any at all. If another player buys a color/property, trade money for it (Example: if a property cost the computer $200, you offer $400 or more.)  Once you have the property, mortgage it.  This strategy will keep the computer from monopolizing anything.  Almost any property can be bought for $1,000, which won't be a problem for you since you would have accumulated a fortune from not having to pay rent to anyone.Otherwise, the game is very entertaining.  Try downloading some of the other 3D animated boards.  They're a real treat.  I hope they make more downloads in the future.

{"reviewerID": "A3URVWPFJOHT72", "asin": "B003KMHBCA", "reviewerName": "zlionsfan", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "Board games are great family games, but for some reason they just aren't as prevalent on console systems as you'd think they'd be. As a result, demand is typically high, and quality tends to suffer. EA's also not known for putting forth quality efforts when they're not challenged, so I really shouldn't have had high expectations for this game, and as it turns out, the game actually is disappointing.The one thing EA gets right is the game itself. Too many older games, both board and video, are released as NEW and IMPROVED versions, but most of them don't appeal to newer gamers: the market for these games consists of the people who played them when they were younger. Monopoly Streets isn't like that: there isn't some kind of crazy remake where you battle other players for properties or anything. You can follow the original rules to the letter (does anyone actually do that at home? We sure didn't), use a predefined set of custom rules, or tweak one of the sets to your liking. (Unfortunately, you can't save your own custom rules; you'll have to choose them each time.) There are enough variations and rules to satisfy pretty much anyone who's experimented with their own rules.That's about the best of it, though. Every game is a four-player game: there's no option for more or fewer players. The properties each player holds are indicated on the board as you play, but you can't get details on a property (for example, if you're looking to trade or trying to evaluate one), and it's not always easy to tell who owns which properties within a group. The tokens talk during game play, but it's really annoying, and although you can mute the sound, you can't turn off the automation, so you're forced to wait while a token and its corresponding character do a little dance before it moves. (Thankfully, you can turn off the animation that tracks a token from space to space.)The rules for the \"speed die\" variants are explained very poorly, or in some cases not at all. There's no in-game help, which is really odd: EA's infamous on the sports side for putting together a two-page instruction manual and expecting you to buy a strategy guide to figure out how to play. So if you missed the part that says you can move anywhere when you roll triples, too bad: the game won't tell you that. Not sure why the Bus will only let you move to one of three spaces? Too bad, you get no explanation. Didn't know that once all properties are purchased, Mr. Monopoly moves you to the nearest property on which you'd have to pay rent? You won't find that anywhere. (Yeah, that makes a big difference strategy-wise: you're better off mortgaging your cheap properties to force people to land on the expensive ones.)The AI, even on Hard, makes terrible decisions. I understand the part about offering you trades unbalanced in its favor, but some are just incomprehensible. It'll ask you to complete its Red monopoly, and in exchange you can have one of three Oranges; the other two are owned by different players, but too bad for you. Those are easy enough to decline, but that doesn't help when one AI offers the trade to another. I've seen an AI give Park Place to another AI who had Boardwalk, getting only a second property in a color group in return. (That game didn't last much longer.) Of course you can use this to your advantage as well ... I thought Hard AI would be more intelligent, and that's disappointing.You earn points for each game you play, and you can use them to unlock tokens and boards, but really, it doesn't add that much to the game, especially given that you can only have four players. (There's more of a need for additional tokens if you've got more people playing.)If you have to have a Monopoly game for your console, I guess this one's all right, but I wouldn't pay full price for it.

I have YET to play a computerized board game where the AI didn't cheat.  If there is a window of \"chance\", you can expect the AI to exploit that \"chance\".  That being said, this game is one of the worst culprits for this to come along in a LONG time.There isn't much to write home about.  It's Monopoly.  It's computerized.  It supports up to four players on the same console and online multiplay.  The \"city\" boards are awesome.  However, unless you feel like forking over $7 there are only two of them.  The rest of the boards are all the same thing with different names.  To summerize:  the city boards involve a \"cityscape\" appearance with each color group offering a slightly different look to the houses and hotels.  This gives you a real desire to build up as many properties as you can if only to see what they look like.  However, you only get the two \"cities\" with the remaining boards being simply that: game boards.  The houses are green the hotels are red.  It takes away from the unique ideas incorporated in to this game and sadly the unique ideas are one of the few glimmers of good in this otherwise frustrating experience.As far as the AI goes:  it DOES cheat.  I played a game with two family members and an AI.  With over $2,000 dollars, the AI became the target of us.  I began to build up in hopes to nail it.  Sadly, I ended up taking out all my family members with the remaining game taking an additional HOUR AND A HALF to wrap up.  The AI literally took 25 trips around the board without landing on a single square that cost even a dollar.  Community Chest yielded it payouts.  Chance yielded it payouts.  It owned five properties and consistently landed on those.  I owned every property from Park Place to New York Avenue (thanks to some teaming up on my family's behalf).  That's exact people.  And yes it really went around 25 times before it hit any of my properties or even had to pay money.  That isn't fun.  That's annoying.Sadly, cutting the AI out doesn't help much.  The AI seems to pick its favorite and the rest are left to pay dearly.  In yet another game I went to jail 3 times in a row and paid over 2,000 in taxes.  At least I earned some trophies (yes, they knew this game was going to screw you so bad they actually have trophies for getting screwed over).  The \"random\" dice rolls will favor one over the others and you'll play hell trying to overcome if that's the case.To add some insult to an otherwise annoying game, I got screwed out of my Monopoly money extras.  The additional tokens and boards I used my hard earned Monopoly money to unlock are relocked.  My family wanted to try out Stratosphere City.  So I bought it (along with the extra tokens in hopes to find one less annoying).  My reward was losing everything I had unlocked in game up to that point.  The game still says I have racked up over 60,000 in M money, it says I only have 471 in M money left, yet no clue as to where I spent it all.  I am back at square one.In short, if you have family and friends and want an easy way to play Monopoly, this is your game.....so long as you wait for it to drop below a Jackson (sorry for the code, but Amazon is so anal about putting actual amounts.)  If you are going to want the extras, buy them before you unlock anything else.  Otherwise this game is a \"rent with extreme hesitation\" and that is it.

I read the first 5 or so reviews here at Amazon and thought \"this is it, what I've been waiting for\"....Not quite. After 3 days with this game, dealing with the frustrations of resetting ALL the features to MY preferences every single time I begin (it  forgets everything you set it to when you start over!!!!), and the worst fault, one of the AI players you play against rolls ENDLESS \"doubles\" on the dice, allowing them to advance across the entire board, buying up EVERYTHING while I roll endless 4 0r fives and never get anywhere except to their now owned properties? NO thanks. Then, that other AI  player begins rolling doubles TWICE at a time and doing so 25+% of the time? My wife doesn't even know how to cheat THAT bad! C'mon......this just isn't fun. I have mine for sale on Craigslist this 4th day of play. Sorry, I wanted this to be a relaxing game of chance. NO chance here and I regret it immensely. Graphics are nice as long as you turn OFF the endless animations that bore you to death after the 3rd or 4th run around the board. I also found myself enjoying the regular old fashioned board (available in this game) WAY more. Simply because it better allowed me to see who owned what. Not really able to tell so much if playing with the new interface board. It seems a choice of be entertained VS play the darn game?So I regret the designers choice to stack the deck as it were with this idiotic mess of having an AI player who rolls doubles every single time they roll the dice. It simply make me ask, \"WHAT'S THE POINT\"! My copy used for less than 1 hour is now for sale for $25.00. If I can't dump it, I will donate it to Children's Hospital or similar Charity in hopes that if 4 people actually play head to head, MAYBE the computer doesn't allow this dice \"glitch\"? I only have one single controller so I am unable to test this. Best of luck to those who buy. They did just a wonderful job if not for the AI & that your settings are not remembered.

The cheating is blatant, undeniable, inexcusable, illogical, anything but random. In addition to all the doubles, getting exact dice rolls to skip over human-owned properties, etc., two AI players will work together against the human player. For example, they will deny a trade for 200% (or more!) profit in their favor with a human, then trade the SAME property for face value or less to another AI player, giving that AI player a monopoly.AI players will also barrage human players for trade after trade after trade, almost always a ridiculously bad deal for the human player, and if you accidentally hit the OK button to stop all the pop-ups, you accidentally give away one of your properties for less than it is worth and there is no way to correct that mistake without ending the game.To sum this review up, I now suspect my wife conspired with this games developers.......  :-))Mike", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Had Such HIGH Hopes.....", "unixReviewTime": 1291680000, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2010"}

But it turns out that reading the all-important warning at the beginning of the game is a good idea.  HOLD THE WIIMOTE HORIZONTALLY, NOT VERTICALLY, WITH THE \"1\" and \"2\" BUTTONS ON THE RIGHT AND THE POWER BUTTON ON THE LEFT.  After figuring this out the hard way like a moron, I boosted my rating to 3 stars immediately.  Derp.There are a number of pluses about this game, but the negatives are fairly severe.  It'll be up to the user to decide to what extent said negatives impact their gaming experience.  Also keep in mind that someone coding her own implementation has thought more about interface design and game play for Monopoly than the average Jane, so it's possible I'm a little harsher than I might otherwise be.  Then again, the designers and coders at EA should be able to do a better job than an undergraduate computer science minor.POSITIVES:-The #1 benefit to this game is its creative visual twist on the classic board game.  I'd actually envisioned it as a set of literal properties in the past, so it's really cool to see the game come to life.  They did a good job with the animations, and it's fun to look at the game quite literally from a different angle.-They included 6 or 7 different game scenarios.  The classic Monopoly is there, of course, but you can also play other twists, such as having the endgame condition be \"the first player to obtain two color groups wins\" (my least favorite), or the scenario \"all properties are improve-able and may be traded with houses/hotels on them... first player to double their worth wins.\"  Some of them are pretty interesting.-All of these game scenarios can be customized with several pages of menu options.  You can even save a set of customized rules for future games.  Worth a whole star in itself, in my opinion.  Awesome!-The menu and interface to mortgage, buy, and sell houses is a vast improvement over the click-heavy old one (in the other Wii Monopoly game).  You can do it all with ease from one menu.  Mad props to the EA folks for this huge improvement.-The music creates a mood without being obnoxious or particularly noticeable.-I see my family members' Miis walking around the streets.  A very cute touch.NEUTRAL:-One of the other reviewers complained that you can't see the overall game board except after your turn.  That is not entirely true.  They don't mention it anywhere, but I serendipitously discovered that **if you hit the \"A\" button at the beginning of your turn, you can see the overall state of the board**.  Granted, I wish they would have a small \"overall state of the board\" picture at the bottom of the screen, but I do think that it would be distracting from their cool animations.  So I understand why they would make it something that you can only see every so often.  But it's still a shortcoming that there are only certain times when you can see the whole board.  It's hard to visualize and keep track of.-Unlockable pieces, boards, and the ability to use Miis.  That last one, I feel should be an option from the beginning.  Fortunately I was able to unlock it after one game.  Also, most of the boards are just repeats from the other Wii Monopoly game.-Keeps track of your overall stats (such as number of jail terms and other fun trivia).  Unfortunately, it makes no distinction from user to user.  So it combines stats from all members of my family.  Maybe my family is just competitive, but on games such as Wii Jeopardy and Wii Wheel of Fortune, we enjoy trying to outdo eachothers' stats!NEGATIVES:-The worst thing about this game, in my opinion, is the unbelievably annoying nature of the non-Mii playable characters, with whom you are stuck if you play by yourself.  What was EA thinking on this one?  Is there seriously anyone out there who finds this cute?  They all speak in gibberish utterances with maniacal laughs, grunts, or \"huh?\"s.  About the only person who says comprehensible words is the wheelbarrow farmer girl who will randomly say \"Howdy howdy howdy\" or a barely understandable \"Eh, come on...\"  I admit that I'm starting to get numb to it, but... seriously?  Whose bright idea was this?  I'd consider docking almost an entire star for this.  There's no way to turn just that off, either.  It's indescribably obnoxious.-Mr. Monopoly's comments are slightly less annoying than in the other Wii Monopoly, but apparently they've decided to trade \"annoying\" for \"lame.\"  Want some examples?  Sometimes landing on a Chance/Chest will elicit a \"Awwww, did someone send you a love note?  *exaggerated kissing noises*\"  Or landing on a property will sometimes trigger the comment \"This is a lot of land!  Get it?  Lot?  Land?...\"  I still find myself shaking my head and wondering what the writers were smoking when I hear some of these things.-The animations take forever.  There is a \"fast forward\" button, but the constant need to use it sort of negates the primary \"positive\" about the game.  Why couldn't they just make the animations shorter?  I don't need to watch the woman playing the dog do a disco dance at the beginning of each turn.  (A very minor example, but the point still stands.)  It's unnecessary to stop at \"Go\" every time someone passes it, just so Mr. Monopoly can run over, say something stupid, hand over some money, leave, and then have the player do a little dance, and finally continue their move.  Seriously.-Largely because of the last bulletpoint, one game takes forever.  You might want to have something handy to fill the times when you're not doing anything.  Like Christmas thank you notes.  Or margaritas.  Or writing this review.

We've played about 38 hours on the game, with our best game's net worth being 38,000.There are some down sides to the game that do annoy me:The artificial intelligence of the computer players is not very good. Sometimes they will trade for the most ridiculous things. If trying to trade to complete a color group, they want another property of the same color group to complete the trade. Often they don't try to get complete color groups, or trade for really low or high prices.I think the game cheats! Whenever you start winning, it almost always seems that the computer plays start landing on GO! and Jail/Free Parking/Community Chest every roll, earning large sums of money. Many of the computer players will last for most of the game with two or three non-related properties and have thousands of monopoly dollars.If you land on a property and don't have enough to pay, there are times when you can trade the player that you owe money, and the game forgets that you owe them money. This basically gets you free rent, but you lose a property. You can't trade property in exchange for the rent due, only trade to earn enough money to pay the rent, but this bug just ends up giving you the money from the trade and bypassing having to pay the rent.The characters are very annoying. Especially the wheelbarrow lady. While the animations and audio clips are funny the first few times, they get old, fast. You can turn off the animations mostly, leaving only a few that slow down the game: being in Jail, landing on GO!, etc. You can not turn off the annoying character voices.Characters:Wheel barrow: Trashy hick girl who is super annoying. The only funny thing she does is kick the wheel barrow and hop around afterwards.Dog: Movie star whose dog barks a lot. Otherwise not too annoying.Car: Fat guy in a small car. The guy is very annoying saying gibberish. \"Ahh HAAA!! Beep beep!\" \"Humber a naw!\"Iron: A maid who taps her feet over and over. While trying to navigate the menu her foot steps can drive you nuts.Battle Ship: Character looks like Fidel Castro and his ship honks after every move. The honking gets old fast.Top Hat: Little boy with a really high pitched voice.Shoe: Little girl with high pitched voice.Police Hat: Unfit police man who is one of the least annoying of the characters.Money Bag: Robber who acts very sly and is fairly quiet.You can use your Mii character in place of the above characters using any of the pieces available. To be able to do that, you have to play a few times to earn some money that you can use to unlock that feature.Other things that you can unlock include several different boards and some of the above mentioned characters. I don't like a lot of the boards, they are just different property names based on the theme of the board. There is sweets, cardboard, ice, cheese, jungle, and plaza board. Personally I like the 3D boards: Monopoly City, and Landmark City. The graphical design of those boards is nice, with the buildings all built up; gives you more to look at.While it is true that the properties you own are shown as a tiny card in your corner, it is not that bad. You can just go into the build and mortgage menu to see them much larger. The thing I really don't like about the mortgage menu is that you can not see the colors of the properties once they are mortgaged; they all look red when mortgaged. For new players this is a disadvantage.It is also fun to play by different rule sets, but they don't tell you much about what they mean. The printed manual and in game instructions are only a brief overview of the different rule sets. The one that got me was the Mr. Monopoly Roll because it changes:If you get the Mr. Monopoly and finish whatever business you have to finish from the square you land on, on e of two things happen:If there is unowned property, you go to the closest one and can buy it, orIf there is no unowned property, you go to the next closest property that you will owe money on.Before I looked it up online, it seemed like there was a bug or something. When playing with the computer characters, it is hard to make sure that they are going to the correct places. Now that I know what the Mr. Monopoly roll means, it makes more sense.Setting custom rules can be fun and really makes the game play different. You can double the salary from GO!, and add free parking money. Change Tax rates, mortgage interest, etc.We are basically happy with the game. It can be fun if you ignore a few things. I wish it was possible to \"buy\" more add-ons to the game to make it more interesting. I would like to turn off the annoying character audio clips. Online play would be nice, if I knew anyone who had a Wii and Monopoly Streets.Edit:Playing the game with my wife today, two things happened:1. My wife rolled and the speed die came up as a Mr. Monopoly. All properties had been purchased in the game by this point. She landed on a property and had to mortgage or trade to pay the rent. She traded a property and then when the time came for her to move to the next property that she would have to pay rent on (because of the Mr. Monopoly), the game just went on to the next player. She should have had to land on the next property and pay rent.2. I rolled a Mr. Monopoly and landed on community chest. The card that I received told me to move to the next railroad and pay double. I landed on the first railroad and paid my $400. Then the Mr. Monopoly roll moved me to the next railroad and I had to pay $400 again. I think it should have only been $200 that second time.The game cheats!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A fun game despite its flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1293840000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2011"}

I loved to play Monopoly before I bought this video game so I was excited to see my pieces moving around.  There are things I like and don't about this game.I was hoping that I would be able to immediately play as my Mii but this feeling was rectified on many levels. First, you can't beat the original pieces, and now they're hilarious!  For example, I chose that little terrier dog piece, thinking I would be given a little silver terrier that moves around the board.  What I was given was a very stylish young woman, asymmetrical hairstyle, sunglasses, dangerously high heels, and then her little doggie is your terrier piece. The wheelbarrow is a barefoot country girl named Natalie who pushes the wheelbarrow. Each piece you select is accompanied by a person (each person has a name except for the terrier-woman who is just called \"dog\" in the Streets Monopoly board. I don't like that).  You don't have access to all the pieces, you have to win money and unlock them. The funniest thing is, the Miis you have created for your Wii are the city folk who walk around town. I attend school far from home, so my Mii people are members of my family.  My stylish woman was walking the dog around the corner of Free Parking and there was my sister, waiting to cross the street. A few minutes later, there's my mom walking down the sidewalk. Later, I found out that by winning games and thus earning money, you can \"buy\" your Mii so that you can play him or her in the game.The graphics are pretty cool. When you build on a property, a nice house or hotel goes right up. Naturally the hotel that gets built on Baltic Avenue is nothing compared to the ones built on Park Place or Broadway! Cars and trucks drive by on the street. The Banker reminds me of Lenny Briscoe from Law & Order because he always has these one-liners. If you have never played before, he walks you through the whole game, explaining every little detail. There are a lot more boards you can play, but most of them are locked. It only makes me want to play more, earn more money and unlock those boards.  I can't wait to see what they look like.What I don't like is that it seems to be fast-moving, to the point where I think it may be buggy. Before I buy a property and especially before accepting or rejecting a trade, I like to get a bird's eye view of the board to see who owns what first.  This is not possible. You may see the entire board before you roll your dice, but once you land on a property this feature is unavailable. Also, in the corner are all the cards/colors of the properties I own, but they are so darn small that I can barely make sense of them.  It would be nice if there were a button to temporarily amplify this view. When I played my first game, I would periodically be led to a screen that displayed the players' net worth, but I the screen went by so fast I kept thinking, what was that? Then about 15 minutes into the game, Mr. Banker stops at that screen to explain it.  Later when I declared bankruptcy and was taken back to that Net Worth scene, the screen just went black and stayed there until I pressed \"2\" to fast forward.I've only played the game a couple of times. I haven't played online yet but I'm looking forward to it and will be sure to come back and update when I do. I love playing this game by myself with a cup of tea, curled up on the couch but playing online against a stranger seems fun!UPDATE:  Although the above description says that you can play online, this is not possible with the Wii.  I've looked and looked for it in my game, until a comment by a reader led me to the EA.com page.  Online play is only available with the PS3 and Xbox.

You kind of lose where you are in the Streets version even though they made it fancier with skyscrapers and pedestrians. It just didn't draw us in because it didn't really feel like monopoly. It was more like you were just going along for the ride which was kind of boring. But then I decided to try to original monopoly board option playing against the computer and it was much more fun!

I would spend hours on pogo playing Monopoly Here and Now Edition. After much research I did see there were two versions of the Monopoly game. Monopoly Streets and monopoly Here and Now Edition. After endless days of reading customer reviews I have decided to go with Monopoly Streets and so glad that I did. It offers endless hours of fun!The streets and the 3d buildings are sooo beautiful, and also you can play classic monopoly on the classic board. There are other boards that you can unlock as you build monopoly money and one other 3d city you can unlock. You can also unlock Tokens and the ability to use your Mii character (which really sold me on this game).There is different ways you can play the game and you can also customize the game play anyway you want to make interesting. I just the love the fact that I can play monopoly and not have to count the money (the game does it for you) and no pieces to clean up after wards!Also, there are characters that go along with the tokens, these characters are funny for the first time you play the game but afterwards they can get a bit annoying, like the dog token comes with a lady, the wheelbarrow token comes with a redneck girl, Who is my favourite because she kicks her wheelbarrow when she has to pay max rent to someone and you can hear her say oww lol that cracks me up!You have the option to play with Easy AI, Medium AI or Hard AI.. The computer players arent hard to beat.. It definately nice to play a game by yourself considering the computer players are very easy to trade with, playing with more people can be frustrating because they dont want to trade.

Despite reviews of lag, I've noticed none. Although to their defense, I have not tried the turbo or joy stick controllers, just the originals. EDIT: (I have since tried it with the AsciiPad super NES controller and it does indeed lag with the turbo/slow functions making them to slow to be useful. But it works fine for basic control and brings back that authentic experiance, complete with sore thumbs and blisters)If you want to play wii classic games with their original controller this is a great product. There really is no alternative unit that combines these three systems. I have seen them separatly but not together. I will be keeping it for this reason. Think of it as a 3 in 1 retro adapter.Forget about the N64 port, it's unplayable. The N64 port works but GTRON maped the buttons instead of adding a remapper. It should have been Z>L instead of Z>Z in the majority of N64 games. But even if they did that, it would not work for all N64 games as some require the Z=Z maping. Nintendo changed the mapping to work for the GC and Wii classic controlers which is the root of the problem. GTRON should have resolved it in the firmware of their adapter. They didn't. The Result is that the Z button and the left shulder buttons are reversed. Every other button works fine and the thumb stick senseativity was correct on mine. Also, the rumble pack is NOT supported. The wii virtual console doesn't support rumble anyway, so I tested it on the gamecube Zelda OOT/MQ promo disc where I know rumble is enabled.***EDIT***I thought I should mention that the above is true only for the Virtual Console Games. Thanks to the HomeBrew channel hack and emulators you can emulate N64 games, as well as other systems. If you intend to do this, then this adapter should work as expected. The controls are mapped 1:1 to the N64. However, rumble still won't work.**********The List of N64 games I've tested:- Zelda OOT/MQ (Promo disc)& MM: No Z targeting or \"Stone of Agony\"- Mario Cart 64: No firing pickups- Starfox 64: No Left bank/roll- Super Mario 64: Works perfectly! WHY? Z&L; have the same function.Easy mistake to make if you don't test your product before releasing it to the public. This is a real shame when all that's needed to fix it is by adding a remapper so you can customize button assignments manually.I reccomend this as a 3 in 1 adapter that plays Mario 64. I'm satisfied with it as such. Get a separate adapter for the other N64 titles. I found a 2 in 1  N64/Playstation 2 adapter with custom mapping. Now I have a 5 in 2 adapter.

Not only did the original deliver, but even more work has gone into truly improving it. This PLATINUM edition is patched (to the latest version, 1.5), DRM-free and uncensored. It also offers about 10-12 hours of extra gameplay, as it comes with a Bonus DVD containing new adventures, a printed Guide, printed Manual and a soundtrack CD - all in a beautiful cardboard box, reminding us of the golden age of gaming.THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL cRPG GAMES I HAD EVER PLAYED - AND NOW IT IS GORGEOUS!The environments are detailed, realistic, and can be experienced from up close. Grass, flowers and tree branches moved in bothFableandTitan Questas well; these, however, seem so true I caught myself reaching for my...antihistamines! Weather affects and day-night alterations (you have to see the elongating shadows to believe them!) are just gorgeous! More importantly, these are not just eye-candy: certain NPCs and monsters appear only when the correct combination of time-of-day and weather coincide...The horizon is far and the clouds move in endless variations. It reminded me of the sky of the original UNREAL, another visually ground-breaking game at its time. PURE VISUAL MAGIC!The character (Geralt) can master both sword-fighting and magic spells (what is known as a Warlock). To some die-hard RPG fans this may seem like heresy, nevertheless, keep in mind that multi-classing is not unheard off. The movement repertoire for both practices are impressively designed. Especially the sword-fighting, it is at par to any console action game. And the spells (both offensive and defensive ones) are not less impressive.Free roaming? Yes and no. One can decide which parts of the map he will visit but loading is still needed to travel even annoyingly short distances. And since quests and side-quest still have to be completed, yes, eventually a subtle, yet ever present, directionality is present.Looting and bartering? Aaah...yes, sort of. You practically never change the sword you start off with (although you do get to improve its abilities), whereas good armor is only a little easier to come by compared toPlanescape: Torment. On the upside, you get to gamble, have romantic relationships (FABLE was full of great ideas after all!) and bribe for information, so trinkets have other uses as well.Detailed character modifiers? Nothing like the AD&D; rules. You gain talents (gold, silver & bronze) which you can spend to improve your fighting or magical abilities. Pretty much like theDiabloor theTitan Questabilities systems.So, apart for the slight action-cRPG handicap, I have only two other objections. First, the...camera placement. Once more the notorious Aurora Engine (remember NWN2...?) will keep auto-placing it where it is bound to get on your nerves - as it targets your character even if that is not the most logical option. Yes, this has indeed improved compared to the original but one cannot teach an old dog new tricks.Second, the controls. They need getting used to as the fighting combos are still easily ruined by clicking out of sync. You do eventually get the hold of it, however it keeps glitching.Nevertheless, its shortcomings are not enough to diminish the breath of fresh air this release brings to the scene. The Enhanced edition not only is a truly reworked game but it also comes full with detailed Manuals, beautiful Maps and all the extras that games used to come with in the good old days...TheBaldur's Gate Sagawas a masterpiece but (by today standards) is visually wanting to the casual gamer, whereas theNeverwinter NightsSerieswas found, well, wanting in most aspects. THE WITCHER is DREAM cRPG that BIOWARE was supposed to be capable of releasing all along but never did - until very recentlyDragon Age: Origins.That dream game, however, is finally here - and not from whom you would expect. A tip of my hat to CD-PROJECT for keeping the ART-FORM of PC Gaming alive. Well done indeed!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "GAMING AS IT SHOULD BE!", "unixReviewTime": 1278720000, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "A1N2J7Q1WNQK25", "asin": "B003KZJA9Y", "reviewerName": "E.S.", "helpful": [25, 27], "reviewText": "Let me first and foremost state that I'm a newcomer to the international football, having only gotten interested for the past year.  My first Fifa game happen to be last year's edition, Fifa 10. Football is definitely a game for those of us with patience and attention to detail, so it's not for everyone.  I would not recommend any Fifa game to anybody unless they knew the rules and would prefer the game for what it is, an authentic take on football, rather than look for some type of instant gratification.Fifa 11, is definitely a MASSIVE improvement from its predecessors.  I'll essentially list out the major changes from Fifa 10 to 11.Pros:Authentic passing:  Definitely something only the purists of the sport will truly appreciate.  This feature is probably the reason why people cannot simply pick up this game and enjoy.  I'll admit it takes a lot of time to master.  Keep in mind, for the sake of making the game as realistic as possible, EA took out the \"pinball\" passing from Fifa 10 that let everybody blast precision passes from all parts of the field to one another.  Yes, it made things easy, but international football is definitely not an easy sport in any sense.  You have to pass ahead of your teammates to catch them in stride, as players do in real life.  Not only that, but you must take control of the person you're passing to right after you kick the ball, this is not automatic and you have to really pay attention.  Passing is definitely the most frustrating part of trying to play this game, I'll admit it had me flustered for the first week I had this.  But with practice, you'll truly appreciate what EA has done this year.Graphics:They get better every year, admittedly.AI:The computer got smarter, thank goodness.  I thought I could play this game on Professional, having played Fifa 10 extensively, but it was a no go.  So I've been playing on Semi-Pro to build my skills up.  Even on this difficulty, defenders and opposing players will AGGRESSIVELY come after you for the ball.  You can't sneak passes past them because they're smart enough to stick their feet out to deflect it.  They're also smart enough to do moves to shake you off, rather than running in a straight line or whatever, they definitely got brains this time around.  Their passing is refined as well, they consciously survey the field looking for open teammates to pass to.Career Mode:EA revamped up their career mode by allowing you to either play solely as your own created player, solely as a manager, or to do both. Options are neatly organized in my opinion.Troublesome features/parts of the game:PK shooting: Yes, it's a lot harder this time around.  But realistically is it easy?  Of course not, so why should it be any different in a game trying to EMULATE the game.  Like anything, it takes practice.  I myself think this was something EA needed to make more difficult.Transfers: I read somewhere EA would make transfers more \"realistic\" by allowing you to negotiate with the club before the player, but either way, it's still ridiculous.  I was using FC Barcelona trying to pry Cesc Fabregas from Arsenal.  His list value is upwards of $68 million, so I offered $70 million.  Arsenal said they would consider a slightly better offer.  So I exit out and reenter the transfer screen to offer him a new deal.  Then they're asking for something like $80 million?  Yes, he's a superstar player, but the transfer system in here is still basically based on how much you're willing to offer.  EA needs to redo this completely, allowing for MANY new variables when trying to sign players.  I think personal feelings (where they grew up), playing time, club prestige, club success, success of the manager, and finally money should all account for how much players will consider your team.  Haggling and offering players should definitely be included.  Barcelona recently offered only roughly $35 million Euros for Cesc in real life and I think it's because Arsenal knew he wanted to go back and everything.  Such should be included in the game by allowing factors to alter prices for players.Be a Goalkeeper:  Was EA serious with this?  Who in the hell would want to be the goalkeeper?  This is basically the EA trademark of having a yearly BS feature they hype up that's completely worthless.Player Celebrations:  This was another hyped up feature EA was touting this year.  But honestly, since playing the demo.. I've thought the player celebrations were incredibly unrealistic and saw your teammates celebrate like complete idiots.  If you watch the elite teams play, after they score a goal.. they don't do this crazy crap.  Only teams from the nobody leagues go out of their way to think up a celebration.  This was probably the one thing I hated the most this year.CONCLUSION:FIFA 11 is definitely the epitome of sports simulation.  It's second only to NBA 2K11.  Fifa 10 was great, but everything it did right, EA returned it this year and made the game play as realistic as possible.  This is not a game for casual gamers, but meant for seriously players.  Only consider it if football is one of your top 2-3 sports because you cannot pick it up and dominate as you would want.EDIT 11/1/10I recently bought PES 11, just to thoroughly compare between the two.  I came to the conclusion that if both games were some how combined, then THAT would be the greatest football sim ever.  Both games offer something entirely different.  If you're looking for a fun factor for you and your friends here and there, FIFA 11 is for you.  The controls and game play are a lot easier to grasp.  If you want to play a season mode, but not really care about all the international tournaments, then FIFA and its generic \"cup\" games would suffice.  And lastly, if you're into  yearly EA gimmicks, then this is for you, with its player celebrations and \"be the goal keeper\" junk.  Visually FIFA is superior as is its ease of finding what you want in terms of their menu set up.  I think the players in FIFA have more appropriate stats, while PES's preloaded roster has a lot of questionable stats assigned.  Balls still hit the goal post WAY too often in Fifa.If you're looking for a more difficult to play/master football simulation that has the most minute details put into the game of football, PES may be for you.  I love the fact that it has all major international tournaments: Copa Liberatores, Euro Cup, Copa del Ray, Champions League and even the World Cup built into it.  Getting a patch can get you all non-licensed leagues (Bundesliga/EPL), as well as several more UEFA/FIFA sponsored tournaments.  Presentation-wise, PES looks amazing but it is difficult to find what you want, especially in their version of a manager mode.  Graphically it does look more cartoony.  Performing moves and using the thru-ball are more effective here.  Extras such as different balls, shoes, etc. do NOT cost money, rather are earned with in game points.  There's also SO much room for customization.  You can basically download on line countless teams, players, jerseys, chants, shoes, balls, whatever you want; Fifa definitely doesn't allow you to do that.I just want to say, that I'm not retracting my review for before, I'm merely telling you that my hindsight is 20/20 now after trying both offerings of football this year.  Neither one is thoroughly superior to the other, but they both offer a lot of pluses in their own way.  Depending on what you would prefer, that would be your \"perfect\" football sim.  I myself will keep both as they offer something the other doesn't.  If you are a football die-hard and have been your entire life, PES would probably suit you.  If you are just picking up football now, and would like a good introduction into the sport and you want something that would make you go crazy trying to play it, FIFA would be for you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "READ UPDATE: if you're deciding between PES 11 and FIFA 11", "unixReviewTime": 1286841600, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2010"}

Fey", "helpful": [1, 3], "reviewText": "EA's FIFA franchise has improved dramatically over the last three years, and it is always an anticipated release for me. I've read many of the glowing Amazon reviews, and it's hard to argue against a lot of the features. I honestly can't give this a negative review but I would like to add that, in their quest for realism, EA may have gone a little too far. The game is now frustrating in many ways. Ping Pong passing is gone--and that's good--but it seems that the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. Often the simplest of unchallenged passes go awry. Ball physics seem inconsistent: a light tap for a short through ball will send the ball 30 yards downfield with pace, and it's near impossible to lob a short pass over a defender. Defenders are incredibly aggressive. The 360-degree jostling results in a lot of collisions and players stumbling over one another with ridiculous recovery times. You find yourself yelling 'get up!' after two of your own men run into each other, and then take ages to recover. I would disagree with anyone who says the player AI is improved. Your CPU opponent can do skill moves, but your CPU teammates are still pretty clueless.It's interesting to see that the price has dropped on this game. Normally this title holds its value right up until its next iteration. It's certainly sold well, but I have a feeling I'll be trading this in before too long. Friends I play against--who are as good or better than I am at this game--have voiced similar frustrations. Realism is a fine goal, but let's remember that this is a video game. I play it to do the things I can't do on the pitch. Gameplay is paramount, EA.

FIFA has been great and the improvements in the last 3 years have made it better than PES (IMHO).  This year, the A.I's Field Player intelligence has improved (as well as the keepers), the passing has been modified and players behave more like themselves.  The \"Personality\" feature has really improved this game.  I was a tad bit skeptical when I read about the changes and looked at some of the initial videos.  Then I played the demo and I still had concerns.  I'm glad I brushed those concerns aside and picked up a copy because even though  I've only played about 5 matches so far and have ZERO feedback as far as online play or the new \"Be a GK\" system, I already love this game.  This 2011 version is not just an upgrade to 2010 or a simple \"Kit\" Add on.  The game feels entirely different and it takes a while to get used to.  I play legendary on both FIFA 10 & WC10  and I'm currently playing World Class on this one.

Snyder \"TS\"", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "Every year I tell myself, \"I don't need to spend 60 bucks on a new FIFA\". So this year I just downloaded the free demo off the PS Network, figuring that the demo would alleviate my soccer-playing desires. Well I found myself playing the demo quite a bit. So I trudged off to the local game store and bought it USED. Bad idea. Let me warn anyone on here about buying the game used. Don't do it - unless you're getting a smokin' deal. You're most likely going to end up spending an additional $10 to get all of the online benefits, which is just terrible as far as I'm concerned by EA Sports. Lesson learned on my part.I spend most of my time in the Franchise/Career Mode. You can play as a Player, Manager, or Player-Manager this year. I'm not sure why you'd do anything other than Player-Manager though. The Career Mode has hardly changed at all compared the prior year's version, which is disappointing. The ability to create your own team (using the online pass) is a great idea. However, you can't use your created-team in the Career Mode. You should be able to substitute-out an existing team and use your created team in whatever league you want. It is absolutely maddening why EA's FIFA team hasn't figured that out yet (EA allows you to do it in the most recent NCAA Football though).The Virtual Pro aka Create-A-Player is also basically unchanged from the prior year. This year more of the hair styles are locked and you need to unlock them as you play in matches and unlock rewards. I actually enjoy trying to achieve the goals (ie, make 50 sliding tackles in your career), and it increase replay-ability a lot for me.I also like the ability to add your own music (ie, \"chants\") into the game. For example, when you score with your Virtual Pro, you can have it play whatever song you like that's stored on your hard drive. I use a free editing software like Audacity to clip the entire song down to a more manageable MP3 sample though.Also, the addition of strict/lenient referees is kind of cool. I don't felt like the new Personality+ improvement really adds that much compared to prior year's.One complaint from last year's game was the number of shots that hit the post; they seem to have actually reduced the frequency of that issue.  As always, the game looks great. The players look pretty good compared to real-life counterparts. The licensing and the sheer number of players is fantastic and, by far and away, the most impressive of any other sports game.I've owned FIFA for probably 12 years now, dating back to WC'98. Every year the gameplay changes enough to make it feel like you have to learn a slightly-new game. So at least it updates a bit, but not too radically. At first it's always difficult for me to score goals, but then after a few games, I start getting the hang of it.All in all though, I always feel kind of ripped off for spending so much on a newer, slightly-updated version of last year's game. But then again, I definitely get my money's worth out of it. Highly recommended if you don't have the prior year's version. But only somewhat-recommended if you had FIFA 10 already.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "FIFA 11 - PS3", "unixReviewTime": 1290902400, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2010"}

This happened quite a bit when I began playing the game, but has dropped off significantly as I got more used to the control style.

There's no create-a-player or hotspots in \"Jam\" (which I'll get to later), and my biggest pet peeve is how the game handles shoves.There are no injuries in \"Jam,\" which defeats the purpose of halftime substitutions and limits the use of a shove.  You shove only to disrupt the action or get a cheesy steal, and you absolutely cannot use shove if the CPU/player is in any frame of a shooting or dunk animation, which differs from previous versions of the \"Jam\" line.  \"Jam\" also incorporates the spin/crossover moves which were issued forth with \"Hang Time,\" and those moves let you avoid a shove entirely.  In other words, playing against the AI at the highest difficult level is a real challenge.  It's a lot more fun to play against three humans after you get all the unlockables.The game offers fun arcade two-on-two action, four player support, and extra modes like a game of 21 in which four players can play against each other simultaneously (a great addition).  Unfortunately, you can't best opponents internationally, as there's no Online play.  If you can't get a group of friends together then the replay value of Jam will quickly fade.  There are a ton of unlockables to get you going--and the game tells you how to get most of them if you need help--but the extra modes generally fall short once the unlocking is done.The main mode, \"Classic Campaign,\" lets you pick a team and play through a 36-team journey.  Every time you get to the end of one of the six-team lines, you have to challenge a secret team, which, if you beat, you will unlock.  This mode is probably the most fun mode because every six games you will unlock a few things.Next up is \"Remix Tour,\" which introduces several modes starting with a 2v2 power-ups mode.  However, the power-ups are predictable--they only show up near center court in two designated spots--and not only that, but the effects are hard to discern at first unless the announcer barks the name of the power-up for you.  The end result is the CPU will grab the power-ups before you can even see them (due to the locked cam), and even if you do get one they don't last long enough for you to impact the game.  Filler, in my opinion.\"Smash\" does a better job in the fun department, as it's a mode in which your goal is to damage the opponent's backboard.  Instant classic.  The best way to attack, and the only way to get the final blow, is to either dunk or alley-oop on the backboard (by the way, you can break the glass of the backboard with a dunk during regular games, which is a nice retro-easter egg).  However, it's not as much fun to play the AI in this mode because there's no game clock.  Much more fun to play with/against friends.\"Elimination\" and \"21\" are both best to play against friends as well, perhaps the most fun to play with friends, but \"21\" is fun to play against the CPU as well since you get to set the four opponents.  Ever want to have a halfcourt battle with Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Larry Bird, and Chris Paul?  It's every man for himself in these two modes, and a nice change of pace.\"Boss Battles,\" the final mode of \"Jam,\" can only be unlocked through the four \"Remix\" modes above, which gives you the incentive to play through the mostly boring modes.  The battles are just that, difficult one-v-one games against NBA legends.  Hands down the most challenging mode of the game.I recommend theWii Classic Controller Pro - Whiteto play the game, but another pet peeve I had was you can't change the controller configuration (what button does what).  The way the Classic Controller is setup differs from how you use the Wii-Mote (the B button), which is annoying because the on-screen directions assume you are using the Wii-Mote.  You're even forced to use the Wii-Mote to get through \"Jam Camp,\" an obnoxious tutorial for new players which unlocks \"Big Head\" mode.  Another annoyance is how turbo is used by pushing the \"L\" button rather than the \"R\" button.  Just doesn't make sense for the Classic Controller.While the game lacks the configuration a bug-filled \"NBA 2K\" game might have, \"Jam\" gets you the action and without needing to worry about your Wii console freezing up (2K games are lousy, just a warning--Jam is by EA).  The modes are hit or miss if you can't find someone to play with other than the AI, but the unlockables will keep you occupied for a long time.

Fond memories flooded back as I reveled in the basic two on two revival that feels like a pumped up-modernized version of NBA JAM TOURNAMENT.  I miss being able to control both of my players completely, and I REALLY wish I could remap turbo to B trigger (or R for classic control), and yes the AI plays catch up fast, furiously and often when you start to gain a big lead.  Still there is so much right here that I am willing to learn some new controls, and ignore my quibbles for the sake of pure unadulterated FUN.  I will probably buy the HD remake for the other consoles if we ever get one but for now the Wii version fills the niche nicely.

I still have the college version of the game for the SNES and played it with my 5-year old.  I read other reviews where people are complaining about the graphics compared to the PS3 or X-Box, the fact you cannot play online, or other grievances the game does not have.  These people, it seems to me, are spoiled, arrogant people who have always been given whatever they wanted.  These people can never be satisfied with what it given to them, but must find something to complain about no matter what it is.  Sure, the game would be fun to play with someone online, but it's not a reason to give a bad review because it's not there.  I think you should review games based on what's there, instead of what is not.This Wii version is everything I remember and a whole lot more.  The graphics are amazing for the Wii and brings to life each player.  The gameplay is what makes this game so enjoyable, because there are so many formats to play.The quick game gets you to pick a team to play with and you only get to play one game at a time.  This is good if you want to get used to the game or want to see which teams suits you best.The Classic Campaign is just as it says it is, it is just like the original game.  You choose one team and play as that team against all the other teams.  You also go up against hidden teams, and if you beat them you unlock them in the other modes.  These are teams like Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, Dominuque Wilkins and Spud Webb, Hakeem Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing and John Starks, and much more.Remix Tour is a different kind of game.  You still choose a team but this time you play the other games offered on the game.  These games are 21, Dominance, BackBoard Smash, Elimination, Remix 2v2, and Boss Battle.  21 is just like in the backyard.  You have to be the first person to score 21 points or more.  If you score, you keep the ball.  This is a blast to play against the computer or another player.  Dominance is a game where you have to take over spots on the floor.  The more spots you take control of, the more points you earn.  The longer you keep the spot, the more points you earn.  Smash is a game where you have to dunk enough times to smash the backboard.  Elimination is a game in which the person with the lowest score is eliminated after each round.  You can play with 3 or 4 players.  The last one standing at the end wins.  Remix is the fun 2v2 game where you have power ups on the court you can pick up and use during the game.  The power ups are okay, but could be better.  The quick one is the best power up.  and the Boss Battle is a fun challenge.  You have to beat a player one on one.  You have to go up against the likes or Yao, CP3, Larry Bird, Magic, LeBron, Kobe, and even Dr. J.  They each have their own strengths and the battles themselves are quite different each time.  Larry Bird has a shot where he makes three 3's in a row to give him 9 points, which is hard when you are only playing to 21.These games also have within themselves unlockables to unlock different players.  These are things such as getting 10 rebounds, steals, dunks, jump shots, 3-pointers, and others.  This keeps the game enjoyable well past the initial one player game to beat the computer.As stated in the title, this is a little piece of nostalgia that makes playing video games so much fun.  Thanks Nintendo for reading my journal when I asked for this game to be made.  And thanks Santa for getting it for me for Christmas.

None the less, its still a fun game! The controls aren't horrible, but could've been a little better. I recommend using the \"classic controller\" for it instead of the motion style with the Wii control and nun chuck. Also though....If you have a Wii and either PS3 or 360.

I really enjoy the series.Playing NBA Jam on the Wii has been a real treat, that reminded me immediately of why I've always liked this game so much. Jam on the Wii perfectly captures my memories of how great the game was (and that is hard to do, b/c going back and playing the original I've found it hasn't aged particularly well).The gameplay is fast and furious and fun.There are additional modes, and it is nice to be able to play them co-op, but the majority of my time here will be spent in the simple pick-up and play 4-player versus mode. This is one of the best same-room multiplayer games in existence. Always has been. While the Wii misses online, not playing with people in the same room ruins the fun anyway.All that said, I'm somewhat on the fence about the motion controls. I recommend getting a Classic Controller for the game, though you might find you prefer the motion controls. Dunking by emphatically swinging the controller down is just FANTASTIC! Accidentally jumping and missing a block/rebound/shot b/c you moved your hand too much is frustrating, but it is also occasional and avoidable (and I love the feeling of draining a long-distance jumper by moving the remote).Overall, I love the game. It's immediately become the favorite to play with friends at my place (and work!). If you enjoy the crazy excitement of the NBA, the funniest and most fun commentary ever found in a sports game, or just want to play the best basketball game ever made, you probably should check this game out.

Even those that hate sports will enjoy playing this. It is a great party game. That doesn't mean that this is a perfect game. The obvious thing it's lacking is an online mode. Not really a dealbreaker for me, since my friends all get together and play on the same screen. The major issue we've found is in the computer AI. If you're playing a 2 or 4 player game, you're not likely to notice it. But if there are just 3 of you playing, you'll figure out pretty quick that the computer character is a dominating beast. And this will annoy you to no end. We tried changing the difficulty multiple times, hoping this would help, but it didn't. Also, every once in a while the characters refused to dunk, resulting in a shot that's easily blocked by the other team. The jam camp should teach ALL of the control functions, not just the basics. And we still haven't deduced how certain dunks end up blocked while other times the same kind of dunk appears to be unstoppable. Often times you'll see characters that don't have the ball going up for a dunk. You can pass them the ball and they'll dunk, but if it happens right as you were going to dunk, then you're pretty much screwed; as the other player will be blocking the basket. The computer won't always pass you the ball when you're pushing the pass button. And, what makes absolutely no sense is that, when a goaltending foul is called on a team, that team ends up with the ball (when it should be the other way around). Even with all that said though, this game is still highly addictive and money well spent.

You will need to play on Professional or higher, if you want to make it to the Leaderboards.- Manager mode is simplified quite a bit, but menus are much more cumbersome. Instead of simply playing the games, you now have a calendar mode, similar to the one in Forza 3. To get to the game, you have to let each day pass (smart way to hide the longer loading times). Maybe I'll get used to these menus, but for now, they seem too complicated.- Transfers: You have now a menu to sort by any criteria you want. You can find many top players from Day 1 (unlike Fifa 10), but you will no longer afford them easily. In Fifa 10, you would make an offer slightly higher and the deal would almost always get through. In Fifa 11, if the player plays in the main 11 team, many times you would need to make his club a top offer (up to twice the asking transfer price). Once the club agrees, the negotiation with the player is a separate step. Fabregas would have to wait - I don't have enough money yet.- Some things seem to be out (or buried in some obscure menus???)- no Scouting, Stadium Improvements, etc. Lots of options are in though - how to set up the team, what strategies to use, etc. Some were already available in Fifa 10, but Fifa 11 gives us even more.- Gameplay: AI plays slightly better defense, long passes work better, dribbling is better. Shooting is not as spectacular as it was in Fifa 10, but maybe closer to reality. For a pure fun game, you may want to keep Fifa 10 around, because Fifa 11 is more tactical and scoring is not as easy as before.- Multiplayer: you will need to activate a unique code that comes with the game. If you buy a used game, double check with the seller to be sure they didn't use the code.- Graphics: seems to be the same engine, but the players definitely look better than in Fifa 10.Bottom line - different game from Fifa 10, but still fun. Should you buy this over Fifa 10? Fifa 10 is a pure fun, more arcade type of game. Fifa 11 is more of a sim and is more tactical. Both are great games and different enough to be worth owning.Updated Feb 19th: I am removing one star from the rating, because as of mid-February, the rosters didn't get updated with the January transfers. In Manager mode, the game claims it checks for latest teams, yet still the old teams show up. Torres is still with Liverpool, Pienaar is not with Spurs, Dzeko is not under Man City, Suarez not with Liverpool, etc. This detracts from the game experience. For a game called Fifa 11, they should have 2011 teams.

Still, I thought writing a review was important because I've reached the point where I have taken this game out of my Xbox and I'm no longer going to play it.The first thing I noticed was how good the graphics are -- it's really an incredible game to look at. Player faces are great, the stadiums which are included are great-looking, it really looks very, very good. Now the bad.I spent most of my time playing this on career mode at the professional difficulty level. Here are some of the interesting things you'll notice (suffer through?) during game play:- Somehow defenders can come from behind a player sprinting with the ball in the other direction and steal the ball without any kind of slide and calmly head the other direction. As soon as they make contact, they have the ball. This makes break-away goals next to impossible, even with the fastest players in possession.- It's nearly impossible to score from the middle of the field due to the defenses habit of gang defending. As soon as I have the ball anywhere near the front of goal, at least two defenders will converge and steal the ball. Meanwhile, I can be practically attached to players all over the field without stealing it from them. I have given up a ton of goals where my defender was in the perfect position but it didn't matter. Extremely frustrating.- Heading the ball is a mystery to me. Because I can't score from the middle of the field, I decided to focus on crosses. Thing is, it seems to be random whether my player wins the cross and even more random whether the ball is on target. I have tried aiming everywhere, and the ball will still go into the crowd half the time. That's when I win it. My son counted in one game and I lost 12 headers in a row. Player skill level doesn't matter.- If you play career mode with MLS teams, there is no off-season transfer window because the game strictly adheres to European transfer rules. So the only time you can purchase/sell players in an MLS season is during the summer transfer window. And if you want to improve your team, it's best to buy players from your current league or a lower-tier league because no upper-tier player will play for your team, no matter how much you offer.- Turn off hand balls. You'll concede penalties in nearly every game otherwise. It's hard enough to play against better teams with just the fouls that are called when you're lucky enough to steal the ball.This review is long enough so I've just included the things I found most frustrating. I could probably write a book. It's unfortunate to say but with each version of this game the graphics get better while the gameplay gets worse. I'm not sure what they can do to improve things, but EA needs to take a fresh look at this franchise.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Bad outweighs the good", "unixReviewTime": 1303603200, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2011"}

In short, Ghost of Sparta delivers just what you'd expect. A fun ride, lots of killing, naked women and huge bosses. It excels in the few spots that Chains of Olympus faltered, and successfully brings the entire God of War package to the PSP.The first scene quickly cements Kratos' drive to once again rebel against Athena's words and unleash his fury. A violent vision  recalls a day long forgotten. The day that Deimos, Kratos' brother was snatched away while Kratos looked on, unable to help. Kratos' sole drive in Ghost of Sparta is to rectify that mistake and find Deimos.From the onset you're thrust into the action, controlling a miniaturized Kratos on board a sea faring ship crawling with blade wielding baddies determined to kill you. You slash your way through the hoards using Kratos' iconic Blades of Athena, chaining familiar and new gory combos on ground and in air. New to Kratos' moveset is a running tackle, followed by a barrage of punches. If done without interruption, you can mock your victim as Kratos brutally tears him apart. It isn't long before you face Ghost of Sparta's first boss, the gigantic and menacing Scylla in the first bout of a 2 round battle. Though not as epic as the Hydra or the Colossus, the Scylla serves as a great opening battle to Ghost of Sparta.True to the original format as directed by David Jaffe, Ghost of Sparta's combat is easy to grasp and violently satisfying. Newcomers will be chaining combos and decimating colossal mythic monsters in no time. The button commands are virtually unchanged, so for vets such as myself, getting into GOS was no sweat. The Blades of Athena control as fluidly as ever, allowing you to pull off brutal kills on foe after foe as easily as in any other God of War title. You're also given the new Arms of Sparta; a shield and a large spear useful for taking out distant enemies. Fans of the hit film 300 will be glad to know that GOS pays homage, and includes the famous This is Sparta frontal Kick as one of Kratos' devastating attacks. Unfortunately no, Kratos doesn't yell out \"For Sparta!\" Perhaps next time? There is one glaring problem that wasn't present in past titles. While fighting various foes at once, sometimes they will attack from out of view. They're there but not on screen, which makes it very difficult to time blocks and dodges, especially when you're fighting Wraiths that dig under ground and lunge at you. On higher difficulties, they can prove to be one hell of a frustrating enemy. Not just frustrating, but I want to throw my PSP at a wall frustrating. That'd kill them in one shot for sure, but then i'd be down a PSP. There will be plenty of battles in GOS that will have you seeing the \"You're Dead\" screen multiple times, (the guys carrying the blue orbs will give you migraines) but that's what makes it so much fun. It's difficult and damn near impossible in some sections toward the end, but for the most part it's manageable. Ready At Dawn did an excellent job of shrinking Kratos' psychotic rage and bringing it to the PSP, but we already knew of RAD's prowess didn't we? Ready At Dawn also created 2008`s God of War: Chains of Olympus and Daxter.Ghost of Sparta also answers the age old question of what happened to the City of Atlantis. Well, Kratos got really pissed off and sank it. No seriously, GOS takes place in Atlantis as it's sinking giving the player a remarkable view of an overflowing volcano, just before it destroys the city. Shortly thereafter we visit Kratos' home, Sparta, in what is one of the series' best moments in my opinion. Instead of running through Sparta, blades in hand and killing everything that moves, Kratos slowly strolls through, at one point stopping to satisfy a few dozen women's sexual urges (Seriously, the sex mini-game in GOS tops all the others. No kidding). A brief flashback gives us a glimpse of a young Kratos and his brother, Deimos dueling just before they're forcefully separated at the hands of the then God of War, Ares. Soon after punishing a dissenter, we're given full control once more and allowed to mow down everything in Kratos' path.Once you've completed the game at least 1 time on Normal mode or above, you will have access to the true God of War fan's challenge, God Mode. God Mode is an incredibly difficult setting recommended only for advanced players. Starting a new game will also give you the option to choose from a selection of alternate attires for Kratos, each of which raise certain abilities' powers or reward you with more orbs after a kill. Treasures are back as well. This time we have Challenge Of The Gods, where you must complete 5-8 challenges that Ares and Athena task you with. They seem simple, but are anything but. In one challenge you have to open 6 chests while being attacked by several enemies. Opening a single chest with a few remaining enemies is hard enough, 6 is just sadistic. The Gauntlet, where you must kill every single enemy is bloody fun as well. The 2nd mode in Treasures is the Combat Arena. In the Combat Arena, YOU get to decide who you fight, where you fight and the level of difficulty. These modes are GOS' way of increasing replayability, but  I didn't really play them all that often. They're fun for a short while, but I'd much rather stick to the main game. The next mode is the Temple of Zeus. In this mode you can use the orbs you acquire in the main game to buy unlockables. In addition to all of that, you can also view all the in-game cinematics, a couple of videos about Deimos and a gallery.Cons:The biggest issue with Ghost of Sparta is the occasional off camera enemy who can strike at anytime without giving you any notice.Pros:New additions to the combat make it even more fun.Beautiful GraphicsGreat storyGod of War: Ghost of Sparta is a satisfying ride through the violent world of Greek Mythology, and one that no God of War fan should pass up just because it's a PSP title. Everything you love about Kratos is here, and in spades. At some points Ghost of Sparta even exceeds it's console elders. The final scene is easily one of the best, and one of the saddest in the entire franchise.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Review: God of War - Ghost of Sparta for PSP", "unixReviewTime": 1320969600, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2011"}

Ramos", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I never thought I'd say this, but after playing Ghost of Sparta for the last 5 hours and completing it, I can honestly say I think this is the best God of War title yet in the whole series! It might sound crazy to even think about comparing it on the same level as it's home console predecesors, but it really does stack up and here's why.Gameplay:The gameplay in the game was phenomenal in every way. The enemies were tough and relentless, and the finishing moves were brutal. The new Magic was actually useful, while in the other titles I rarely used them in battle. The extra weapons (or weapon in GoS' case) is fun to use as well as refreshingly original in feel. The boss fights felt titanic, yet flowed well and offered very satisfying climaxes. Overall the gameplay was fluid and smooth, with no rough patches or annoyances to speak of.Graphics:Let's be honest, it's the PSP, there's only so much it can do. But for all it's limitations, Ready At Dawn has made good use of the PSP's graphics processor and must have done all they could to exhaust the framerate. It looks amazing for a PSP title, but it can in no way compare to it's PS3 brethren. That said, GoS is still sure to please with it's mix of scenic landscapes and brutal up-close finishing moves.Story:Now here's where this game truly shines. I've played a lot of PSP games and so far none of them have had any memorable storylines, until now. The story in GoS can only be described as cinematic. It plays and feels like you're watching a movie. A good movie with great acting and interesting characters. I tend to play games for short sustained periods of time, usually cause I lose interest in about an hour. But GoS compelled me to continue playing to see how Kratos' story would unfold. Without a doubt, GoS has the best storyline of any GoW game or any game in general I've played since Uncharted 2, and that's saying something.I enjoyed this game immensely, but the thing I loved the most when I finally finished it, was the fact that it showed that a good developer can make create an impacting gaming experience on any system, despite technical limitations. So there's no excuse for developers to make shoddy games just because they're on the Wii or the DS or the PSP. This game shows that a truly talented game designer can create an awe inspiring game on any platform. So here's to you Ready At Dawn, great job and keep up the good work!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best God of War Game Yet!", "unixReviewTime": 1298246400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2011"}

Everything about this game is perfect. Artwork - Gorgeous, Cut Scenes - Awesome, Game Play - Perfect, Movement and Control - 100% Flawless, Music and Sound Effects - Inspiring, Story Line - Intriguing.I was very pleased in how character control was without imperfection. I never once found myself yelling MOVE! or having to get un-hung from some nook I got myself into or invisible object I got hung up on. I never found a spot where a jump just would not take right and I kept dying, or some move needed to be repeated 200 times before you finally got it to execute properly. When I made a command it was followed and executed per my intentions. Battles were sometimes very tough, but beatable especially after you master the controls and the many weapons and abilities. Save points were well placed, and hidden check points were also well placed except in one instance. Some scenes or areas were a bit too dark, and you would miss a chest with a Gorgeon Eye or Phoenix Feather if you did not relentlessly explore those dark areas and find the nooks, dark passages, and hallways. The story line is excellent with an ending that has to make even the most hardened gamer well up.In the end, GOW Ghost of Sparta is just hands down perfect, and a MUST BUY for any serious gamer who is into the slash and mash style games. Although the designers closed up some of the loop holes in the Krato's story line, in the end they left it open for yet another installment of GOW, and I say do not change ANYTHING and bring it!For now, if your considering this game, do not waste any more time doing the considering, and go buy this game, it is worth every cent.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "GOW - Ghost of Sparta = OMG - This game kicks butt!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1296000000, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2011"}

After finishing the game once colleting as many upgrades as possible (~10-12h) and attempting the challenge modes afterwards, this is what I thought.***********PROS***********ORIGINAL GOD OF WAR EXPERIENCE EXPANDED ON PSP: Yes that means Kratos punishing enemies in the most brutal way possible with his chain blades, climbing/jumping type of platforming and plenty of exploration in ancient greek/roman landscape. This game truly delivers nearly the same experience as on PS2/PS3 God of War games. Quite impressed.GREAT ARTWORK, ANIMATION AND GRAPHICS: The game looks even better than previous PSP God of war game. I truly can't believe we live in an era where we can enjoy such graphics on a handheld device. Truly astonishing. Also, this game contains very elegantly designed characters, carefully crafted structures and sophistically designed levels. It truly lives up to expectation.HECK&SLASH; GAMEPLAY: Just like in previous PSP God of War, you will be able to pull wide range of combos using dual blades and other weapons. Compare to previous game you have access to more moves. Proper use of these combos will punish your foes in most ruthless manner and will give you bonus orbs (for upgrades) while simply button-mashing will get you killed easily. While the combat is not as strategic as say Devil May Cry games, it still delivers.WEAPONS, MAGICS AND MORE: As you progress through game in addition to your dual chain blades, you will get access to some unique godly gears and devastating magical powers. Fortunately, these new tools of destruction are not simple rip off from previous god of war games, rather they are quite distinctive entities that when used right can overwhelm your foes or overcome indomitable obstructions. Some of them are quite fun to use.UPGRADES: Just like previous God of War games, you can upgrade your blades, new weapons and magics giving this game an RPG element. Upgrading your blades unlocks powerful new moves through which you can improve your combos and punish your enemies better while upgrading your magic will give you an edge in battles that would be too difficult otherwise. These upgrades also encourage you to explore each and every corners of the game and do better in battles to get more orbs making the game all the more enjoyable.GREAT STORY: Previous PSP God of War set up a huge bar in terms of story and I am happy to say the story for this game is even better than previous game. The story takes place between God of War 1 and 2. It has decent amount of twist in it and help you explain many thing that are not explained in God of War 2 and 3. Unfortunately, I can't describe much without spoiling it.VERY CINEMATIC: This game has some cutscenes that can go head to head with PS2 God of War games. Cutscenes, nicely designed by animators and carefully performed by voice actors, add great depth and drama to the story. Again can't describe much, but the cut scenes towards the end are simply magnificent.LONGER CAMPAIGN: Very happy to see it has longer campaign than previous PSP God of War. One thing I minded in previous game. So happy they improved it.UNLOCKABLES: You can unlock Trials and art/video gallery after finishing the game. Trials provide you with challenges and adds length to the gameplay experience. Competing these trials and finishing the game on harder modes unlocks more just like previous god of war games.*************CONS.*************LAST BOSS BATTLE AND ENDING: It was pretty good, but I guess, I enjoyed the game so much, I had higher expectation for last boss battle. Don't get me wrong, it was epic, but I wish it was longer and had some punches and depth to it. Same with the ending. It was good and appropriate, but I wish there was more to it.**************CONCLUSION************Chains of Olympus established great standards for God of War on PSP and Ghost of Sparta took the experience to the next level. So no complains here. If you like God of War than this game is a must buy for you.

For the first hour or so of playing this game I was bored. The minor enemies in this game were essentially the same as they were in the rest of the series. Even the places were very similar to what I've already seen in the other God of War games (fighting on ships at sea, exploring a city in a catastrophe). But I continued playing and to my surprise, despite being nearly identical to its predecessors, God of War can still deliver.The combat is the same as the other God of War games. What makes this game different (especially from Chains of Olympus) is you cover a tremendous amount of different settings, from Atlantis to mountain peaks, from Sparta to the realm of Death. The bosses, despite being few and far between, also offer awe-inspiring sequences of action that will have your heart racing. Remember the valley of the crumbling pillars from God of War 2?

{"reviewerID": "A1RNHA547OBQEZ", "asin": "B003L51GW2", "reviewerName": "Gordon \"PS3/PC Gamer!\"", "helpful": [7, 12], "reviewText": "Honestly, I am not sure how to review this game. I'd like to review it upon its own merit, but its a prequel, so comparisons to the other games in the series (most notably Chains of Olympus) are inevitable. We are all PSP owners who most likely have played every game in the excellent series. I scoured the internet and looked up every written review of this game known to man as I desperately waited for my preordered copy to arrive. I was VERY surprised to see that some websites gave this game a 7 out of ten, and I dismissed these sites as the ones who just said \"its the same blades again.\" After finishing the game a mere 4 hours ago, I'll tell you why those scores are justified.To begin, the environments in this game suffer from the same problems as God of War 3 and Killzone 2. They are dull, grey, and dark for the most part. I played through the game just hoping, just waiting for a new environment to dazzle me, but it never really happened. Rocky cliffsides, deserted temples, and firey hell (hades has made an appearance in every game) are everything the environment has to offer. While I don't mind the dullness, its the cramped feel of the entire game that bothers me. I felt like instead of playing through different environments, I was playing from path to path. The problem is, this game was directed by a former lead level designer. I'd expect the level design to be the highlight of the game, but its one of the main problems. The game feels small, cramped and lifeless. There is no \"building in the distance you'll get to later.\" Its a myraid of pathways.As for the magic abilities and weapons, sadly I didn't like any of the new additions. Some if it has to do with the fact that you must press the d-pad to initiate an attack, which may be hard for a split second decision. All of the abilities seem underpowered and lack creativity. I found myself NEVER using magic. I was left with the blades. The same good old blades.....the same blades. In addition, you get a spear and shield combination, which is actually kinda cool. You can block while moving like a true Spartan warrior and throw your spear. Its fun to use against one or two enemies, but against 5 or 6, the blades are much more reliable. One again, I found myself never using the ability unless I was forced to throw my spear at an unreachable enemy or obstruction. The shield was only used in 2 instances against the natural environment. Long story short, this game has the worst magic abilities of any God of War, and the spear was used about as much by me as the spear in God of War 2 was. Almost never.Reguarding the enemies and boss battles, there was some creativity. A new ability giving you the power to ignite your blades is essential against some enemies and obstacles, thus offering a new level of strategy to the fight. Boss battles are few and far between. Of the few, the final battle is the most memorable (obviously), but mainly by default. The final 20 mins of the game are great, and since I was only at the 6 hour mark (10 hours were promised) I was beginning to feel like the story, as well as Kratos' emotions were about to show something completely new, but it all ended 15 minutes later. I won't spoil it, but the final battle brings something new to the series we have never seen, although it was oddly executed. If you know the original, intended ending to God of War 3 (Stig's ending).....then you get the idea. The battle itself was underwhelming as a FINAL battle, but the emotional changes Kratos revealed overshadowed it completely. The other boss battles were completely forgettable.While the series' story is no Metal Gear Solid, Kratos is an angry man on a quest to find his brother. After finding out why he is so angry, you see why he's so angry. Chains of Olympus really helped with that more than the console versions. This game, although it has been renowned for its great story in the reviews, is not much different from the console versions. Its simple and to the point. The bad thing about Ghost of Sparta is that there is little motivation to continue onward, besides knowing that Deimos is still alive. The story is almost too concise and to the point like God of War 2, but as opposed to God of War 2, there aren't tons of environments, boss fights, and cool abilities and magic to discover.The God of War series is absolutely legendary in the gaming world. Its practically synonymous with the Sony PlayStation as a company and is the leader of its genre. This title is a lukewarm effort by Ready At Dawn in my opinion, given their impressive track record. I finished the game in 6 hrs, 20 mins; roughly the same play time as Chains of Olympus for me. Part of me believes that this game was made to fill in a few quick plot holes before ending the series, and another part of me feels like its a final effort to revive the dying PSP. I have no doubt in my mind when I say that this is THE WORST in the series. Chains of Olympus is superior in almost EVERY conceivable way. Ru Weerasuriya should have remained the director after his flawless work on Chains of Olympus.This game is to God of War what Portable Ops was to Metal Gear Solid.I will not just drop 3 stars and leave. I want to be as honest and as helpful as possible. Yes, I see that the 5 other reviewers have 100% helpful reviews and realize that I'm sacrificing my 90% helpful score by going against the norm. I'm here to answer any questions you may have about the game. ANYTHING. Thank you for reading with an open mind and hearing me out.PSN: I-Am-theIRONMANUPDATE NOVEMBER 20th, 2010I finished the game in 3 days, 2 weeks ago. All the challenges, unlocked the vids, costume, EVERYTHING. There are NO incentives to playing the challenges or playing on a harder difficulty because you win nothing for either. If you are a fan like me, you'll play them for the entertainment. Unfortunately, the challenges are so easy its insulting. No need to look at youtube walkthroughs this time around lol, but WARNING: for some reason, whatever setting you have the difficulty on in the combat arena, it will be the difficulty of the challenges. Set combat arena to normal if you wanna breeze through them. The only difficult challenge is the one where you can't get hit once. Those spider things spray green goo at you and kill you instantly!Another disappointment is the lack of any type of Making of featurette. As a matter of fact, there is no videos of Ready At Dawn at all. The game directors live (with preorder) more than makes up for it though. Also, the videos that you purchase with the orbs in the temple of Zeus add NOTHING to the game. In fact, 2 of the 3 reiterate things that were already in the story! In short, those extra videos sucked.For the cheaters, if you want to get a million orbs in 15 minutes, go to the combat arena, select infinite magic and life, and choose 2 minotaurs and a cyclops to fight. Set their attack to off, and MAKE SURE YOU ALLOW THEM TO HAVE INFINITE LIFE AS WELL. When you get to the arena spam the attack you get from Thanatos' daughter. In 15 mins, if you continually hit the left directional button, you'll have a million orbs.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "HONEST NO STORY SPOILERS REVIEW", "unixReviewTime": 1289174400, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2010"}

To sum it up, kratos, as usual Is being tortured by memories from his past, namely those of his brother Deimos.

So kratos, in all his bada** glory decides he's going to bust him out.Characters 9 of 10This entry delves into the past of kratos even deeper, to when the Spartan was a child. It really fleshes out kratos' character and history making a seemingly empty character have true depth and emotion.Graphics 8.5 of 10I played the HD version of the game on the ps3 so it was rebuilt and reformatted. The graphics were sub par to modern standards but for the psp are pretty impressive.Sound/voice acting 9 of 10Sound is very good from the roars And shrikes of the many mythological creatures to the angry screams and grunts of kratos to the wonderful soundtrack of epic, creepy, and downright sad at times.Gameplay/mechanics 9.5 of 10Gameplay mechanics stay mostly the same with some minor improvements over previous entries. It remains the basis for hack n slash games, fast paced, violent, hard, and very satisfying. As in previous titles you collect red orbs to upgrade the many weapons and powers you come across in the course of the game.Age appropriation 16+God of war is controversial for a reason.

I'm here to merely convince that your decision to purchase this game is a good one, and it is.If you are one of those \"Graphics make my life complete\" kind of people...this game also will satisfy that need as well. There are weather effects and fancy lighting and shadows. I don't how much PSP processor power it uses, but it probably is all of it. For fans this game if is a must. If you are new to the series start with Chains of Olympus and then get this one, and all the other games as well.Kratos is meant to be an anti-hero. In time he'll probably be seen as one of gaming's biggest jerks. Maybe that is true, but this game humanizes him a little bit. For that it is definitely a nice addition to the collection.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent Kratos Fun", "unixReviewTime": 1290124800, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2010"}

Ghost of Sparta borrows a lot of what God of War III did, tweaks it, and adds things to it as well. I honestly think Sparta is the best example of how to do a portable game well, and bring a console experience in without cramping the game's style. Sparta is probably the most complete console copy on a portable to date, and there is nothing like it out there.The game is set between the first two and is a side story of Kratos following a haunting vision. The vision of finding his long lost brother, Deimos, and trying to cleanse yet another horrible memory. Along the way you battle through Atlantis and other new locales for the game, but the style isn't anything new. The locales in the game are pretty dark this time around and really focus on the whole dark aspect of the game.The core of God of War is the combat and Ghost of Sparta trumps Chains of Olympus by a mile. Borrowing the recharging meter from III you get to infuse your blades with Thera's Bane and this adds a whole new layer to the combat. Holding down R allows you to set your blades on fire and make them more powerful, but you have to time it and use it wisely. This is also used for breaking down armor on foes that can't be hit normally, environmental puzzles etc. Thera's Bane is really fun to use, and there's a lot of complexity that goes along with it that adds another layer of depth to the standard combat in the series.There are new magical items, but they're not as exciting as one might expect. I never really used them as often as I'd liked to have, but they come in handy in the later levels. The game also borrows the Hyperion Charge that shoulder rams enemies to the ground and lets you wail on them. I also never really found much use for it, and never used it through the entire game except when introduced, so it feels like there's some filler in here, but it's great for people who have a different play style. A whole new weapon is introduced and this is the Arms of Sparta. These are Kratos' spear and shield and it's good for close up combat, and using the spear for far off enemies, but it's not a favorite, and is no good and mid to long range and doesn't have the reach of the Blades. I never really used this except for when it was required during puzzles or exploration.Sparta has a really good story behind it, and it doesn't disappoint with it's epic interactive story elements such as one scene where he fights his own past in a brutal way you would expect in a God of War game. The game also opens up with a classic gigantic boss battle with a Scylla, but it's not as memorable as the console games or even Chains of Olympus. Speaking of bosses that game lacks hardly any with only maybe four in this six hour adventure. The ending boss is probably one of the best in the series with an awesome co-op battle that has never been down before. The game's ending is well worth it, and you'll be pleased with how the whole story rolls out.On a technical term this is the best looking PSP, or handheld game, ever made hands down. I don't think any other developer can make a PSP game look better than one of the best looking PS2 games ever made. Yes, it looks better than God of War II and it's just full of lush detail and is bursting at the seams with effects. If you thought Chains of Olympus looked amazing this trumps it by a long shot. Water drips off every ledge, the backgrounds are fully animated, the game has a high poly count and highly detailed textures with even bump mapping! It's just something to truly behold, and I doubt we'll see another PSP game look this good. Of course the game also comes with frame rate issues and never really goes above 30 FPS and some times drops down below 15, but that could just be my old PSP hardware.The game also has it's usual treasures, but adds the Temple of Zeus and lets you unlock videos, costumes, art etc. by spending orbs you earn during the Challenge of the Gods. You can also create your challenges as well, and this lets you keep playing this epic game without having to tread through the story again (which I know I will be doing again).Other than that though the game is lacking something. It's not as well paced as other games in the series, and the lack of bosses hampers the experience a bit. The game mainly focuses on balanced combat in which you get a variety of foes and must take each battle in a different way since some foes are weak to something and some aren't. As well as focusing on exploration, and there really aren't any puzzles to think of except very simple ones we've seen a dozen times in the series. The game is also just too straight forward and feels more repetitive than the other games, and that's a bit disappointing considered the reputation of the series. However, the game is amazing, and I am not quite sick of seeing what Kratos has in store for us. Is this the last God of War game since III marked the end of the trilogy? Probably not since this is Sony's major staple for it's consoles.

Starting with the PS2's initial God of War and the followup, God of War 2, Kratos has found a lot of success with the hordes of fans his series has garnered.  With the move to the next gen consoles, the PS3 release of God of War 3 may have ended his journey but there's still a lot of story left to tell.  With the success of the first PSP game \"Chains of Olympus\" it seemed foolish for Sony not to tread into the PSP waters again with another release.  Enter Ghost of Sparta.  Does this PSP game carry over the combat and story the predecessors are known for or does it fall flat as a portable release?I consider myself a fan of the God of War series.  I played the first and loved it, but never finished the second.  I'm still playing through the third and plan on finishing it within a week or two.  What I'm trying to convey is that I know about the Ghost of Sparta and his plight to stick it to the gods of Olympus.  If you are new to the series or haven't really delved too deep into your Greek mythology, you may be a little lost.  That doesn't mean you can't enjoy the game, you just might be a little behind on why this \"God of War\" guy is so pissed and his skin is white (hint: it's his family...literally).The game takes place somewhere between God of War 1 and 2.  After defeating the god of war Ares, Kratos takes over as the new god of war in Olympus.  While he is now a god and no longer a mortal, he still has mortal dreams and memories.  One such dream in particular has been tormenting him and he takes off on a journey to find out what it's about.  The journey will take you through the normal gambit of offerings of locations and bosses and if you've played any of the previous games you'll be instantly familiar with it.  The puzzles are a little lighter this time around but the combat is just as frantic as ever.Speaking of the combat, the developers did one hell of a job making the combat feel like the others in the series.  You'll have your weapons and special moves just like in the other games and it all feels just as smooth as before.  The only complaint I can think of would be the PSP itself.  At times, it gets a little awkward holding the PSP and performing the moves.  You get used to it, so stick with it, but it can be a little disorienting at first.The graphics in Ghost of Sparta are truly amazing for a PSP game.  You'd be hard pressed to find another game with graphics this nice of the PSP.  The devs seriously milked the PSP for every ounce of processing power they could to get the graphics as nice as they did.  Just like in the other installments, you'll awe at the architecture and ahh at the gore.The music is another strong suit of the game, just like the others.  While you are battling the hordes of enemies, you'll constantly hear the notorious God of War battle music playing in the background.  At times while exploring, the eerily haunting music of the more solemn bits will tone it down a notch and bring you into the story.  For me to notice the sound of a game is a big deal since I normally just blend it into the background.Ghost of Sparta is a solid PSP game that action fans will like.  Whether you love the game depends on how ingrained into the God of War story you are.  If you are looking for a solid action game this holiday, God of War: Ghost of Sparta has you covered.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "First Impressions - God of War: Ghost of Sparta", "unixReviewTime": 1291766400, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2010"}

I'm a 29 year-old who is busy trying to be successful in life. I try to play games, but truth be told, I go for months on end without ever touching a game. Thankfully, this game has -- temporarily, at least -- snapped me out of the \"GO GO GO!\" phase in my life. As a matter of fact, the release of this game made me go all-out, trade in my plain black PSP and get the God of War: Ghost of Sparta entertainment pack (which I also wrote a review about and can be found here:PSP Limited Edition God of War: Ghost of Sparta Entertainment Pack) which has a truly bad-ass red and black PSP 3000 in it (along with some other goodies). This game has single-handedly made me fall in love with my PSP again. I've been playing this game non-stop since I bought it (so much so that the friggin' batteries ran out on me one time)! Although I'm not finished with the game (and I honestly have no idea how far through it I am since there's never really been a gauge for just how far you are in the God of War PSP games), I'll go through and list what I personally find to be the pros and cons of this game:PROS:This game is insanely fun. I know that's a generic pro, but I haven't been able to sit down and play a game for hours on end in a very long time. And even though the voice actor for Kratos comes off a bit cheesy in his delivery sometimes, the story is very compelling and actually makes you want to watch the cut scenes (when is the last time you actually wanted to sit through the cut scenes in a game!?). There's one part of this game that is one of the most awesome parts I've played in a game in quite a while. It's basically like you're sky diving in an enemy chase scene, but that's all I'm going to say. The point is, once you pick this game up, you're not going to want to put it down.Being a musician and an audiophile, I'm hyper-aware of the music and ambient sounds in a game. With that said, I'm happy to report that the music and ambiance are stellar. The quality of the music in certain places sounds like it's a low bit rate if you're playing through the PSP speakers, so you will get that slight watery/digital-sounding effect but it's all in the low quality speakers of the PSP and not something that is made readily apparent unless you have the volume turned all the way up. If you play this game using headphones, you will be completely immersed and met with stellar audio quality!Lastly, the controls are awesome. They may take you a bit to get used to insofar as button combinations and when you have to quickly press specific buttons during big enemy conflicts, but one of the best features they added to this game was where on the screen they list for you to hit specific buttons when you're supposed to hit them. For instance, when fighting a big enemy, you may have to press a certain series of buttons. When it shows which button on the screen you're to press, the location of the button on the screen corresponds with where the button is physically located on your PSP. For example, if you're supposed to press 'O', it will show a 'O' on the right side of the screen. If you're supposed to press 'X', it will show it at the bottom-center of the screen. If you're supposed to use the analog joystick, it will show it in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen and so on and so forth. Very intuitive and great usability implementation.Lastly, there are tons of combinations readily available to use. If you get tired of killing your enemies using a specific pattern, there are plenty of other options for you to choose from. Oh, and it really goes without saying that the graphics are absolutely fantastic. There's some obvious aliasing going on, but that's to be expected. I had the graphics get slightly sluggish on me just once, but I'd say I'm probably about half-way through the game at this point and have yet to experience that again, so everything with this game checks out wonderfully so far.CONS:The only cons I have are personal nit-picky ones. For instance, sometimes, I can't quite tell if I'm damaging a larger enemy or not. I seem to recall this being an issue for me in God of War: Chains of Olympus as well. Additionally, for those of you gamers out there who are perfectionists and try at all costs not to die even so much as ONCE, you can kiss that goal goodbye with this game even if only for the fact that your path isn't always 100% clear right off the bat in this game. There are certain places where you're going to fall off or not get a sequence of buttons correct the first time, etc. And that's fine -- it's all a part of the experience. So, like I said, no real cons; just a bunch of subjective stuff.Overall, it's a no-brainer to purchase this game -- especially if you're a fan of the God of War series (even if -- like me -- all you've played is the previous God of War PSP game). And if you've never played God of War and you've been looking for a reason to bust out your PSP again, this is the *perfect* excuse to go spend a little bit of money on yourself and break you away from whatever typical life processes may be currently filling your days!

The story takes it's self a while to really get going and explain to you exactly what and why you're doing it but there's plenty of action and gameplay to keep you interested until the story starts to unfold.The graphics and gameplay in Ghost of Sparta just puts Chains of Olympus to shame in every way shape and form, this really is a beautiful little game that borrows a lot of mechanics and elements from GOW3 as opposed to the game it directly follows, GOW. I liked how they focused on the Blades as a primary weapon and only give you the secondary weapon, The Arms of Sparta, which consists of a Spartan shield and spear very similar to what you would see in the film \"300,\" but it doesn't replace the Blades and make you not want to use them but The Arms of Sparta offer a different style of play a more defensively minded offensive strategy but I felt that style slowed down the action too much and I just stuck to the Blades of Athena mostly. I can not tell you how much I miss the Icarus Wings in this game, I've gotten so used to them that Kratos just really feels like he's missing something in the games without them, but that's really just a pet peeve, I realize due to the constraints of the story they couldn't be included but something similar would have been nice. Borrowed from GOW3 are elements such as reusable locales, interaction in-game with huge NPC's (that's Non-Playable Character for anyone not in the know), an ability that is finite in use but infinitely reusable, like the bottom meter in GOW3 for the bow and other special items but in this game it just adds a fire element to the Blades and causes burn and explosive damage, takes a few secs to recharge but then he's all ready to slice and burn all over again. The magic attacks were hit and miss they had one REALLY useless magic and one REALLY useful one and the extra was just, well \"extra.\" The game it's self isn't very long I believe my final save was at 6 hours and 30 minutes but since they have the battle arena mode and challenges of the Gods it makes the makes the game really playable even after finishing the story mode and all the red orbs you collect can be used towards special rewards in yet another bonus section of the game called the Temple of Zeus.As for the story here's where I think the game suffers the most and I'll tell you why I think that.I like what all five directors involved with the GOW franchise so far have done to reinvent the super hero, because lets face facts Kratos is a superhero. We don't know much about him other then that when he shows up big things are going to happen and I think the game diminished that a bit by trying to make him a bit more human and forcing us to go along on the journey of self discovery and personal revelation with him. It doesn't really add anything to the characters ultimate pathos or shed any new light on him. Yes there's a few quickie, \"oh yeah this is where he got the scar on his eye,\" moments but other wise it just doesn't really say anything. Yes in the final moments of the game it explains why Kratos was so blood drunk at the beginning of GOW2 but other wise the story it's self is a throw away in the whole mythos of God of War. The addition of Kratos' brother Deimos into GOW lore was somewhat refreshing although it was kinda upsetting to see Deimos, a guy whose been in captivity since he was a small boy somehow over power and pummel Kratos similar to what Kratos did to Hercules in GOW3. I wish we could have gotten to know Deimos a bit better and I won't post any spoilers but you really only see him for the last 15 minutes of a six hour game, everything else is a flashback of when he and Kratos were children. That's another thing, I never needed to see Kratos as a skinny little boy it ruined a bit of the mystique about the character but I understand some people or maybe most people, are interested in where their heroes came from, I'm not.The stories to GOW have always been simple and straightforward with Kratos wanting to achieve a goal and then doing that and while this story eventually comes to that point it starts off very meandering and is probably the most wandering story in the entire franchise, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing. One of my other favorite game franchises is the Metal Gear franchise and anyone familiar with that series knows exactly how contrived and juxtaposed a still captivating story can be. I just think such story telling techniques have no place in the GOW series.But anyways, if you're looking for bar-none one the best action platforming games available for your PSP this is the one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "God of War: Ghost of Sparta", "unixReviewTime": 1289174400, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2010"}

I bought my 250GB Slim in January for $350; you'll noticed that they jacked up the price on that unit just to sell this bundle.

They are:* High-Definition Blu-ray player for the best movie experience* Free PlayStation Network membership* Internet ready with built-in Wi-FiThese come with all PS3's at no extra cost, and the \"free\" PSN membership implies that you're getting something that normally you'd pay for, which is simply not the case.The only thing you're getting in this bundle is Little Big Planet and an HDMI cable, which is a good deal though not a phenomenal one (I bought my HDMI cable online for a few dollars, and I have no interest in Little Big Planet).  If you buy any PS3 today, definitely get this bundle; even if you don't want or need the cable and game, it's better than being ripped off on a $400 250GB Slim.

He didn't want to play the PS3 in the living room, which my brother bought primarily for the purpose of watching Blu-Rays which were few and far between at that time. Now every time I visit my brother, my nephew wants to play LBP. LBP is good clean fun for younger children, and fun for adults as well.PlayStation3, 2008 to present day:Since 2008, PS3 has improved so much. The console doesn't get as warm. The console takes up less space, and this console in particular can store 250 GB's. Also, since those days Playstation Home has expanded to where it doesn't freeze and is fun. One can buy properties inside the mall, and then furnish those properties to their liking (Santorini, Greece is my favorite). I have to admit I thought it was dumb at first, but quickly I became hooked and purchased all the properties with the furniture packages, walking around with clothes I bought for my avatar at the Diesel store. Oh, and don't forget the free mini-games in Home (try bowling) or just have a conversation with other players while watching the sunset. Most importantly, Home is absolutely FREE!To summarize the Father's Day Bundle:Playstation 3 really has it all! The PS3 Slim is reliable and has proven itself to be a reliable console ahead of the pack. The fact that presently (6/9/10) all PS3 120 GB's and 250GB's are out of stock at Amazon, you can't go wrong with paying $350 for a system that costs the same price with a 5 dollar HDMI cable (I usually buy Amazon Basics) and a game that a father can enjoy with his son.

I generally stick to RPG/SRPG, Sim and Strategy type games so HM titles are sortof always on my periphery. I got this game for my girlfriend to play with some store credit I had (I got her a DS to try to introduce her to a little bit of gaming because she generally does not play) and she quickly became addicted. After about a month or so of her playing I started jonesing to play too.Yeh so we were both pretty hooked. Grand Bazaar brings the same Harvest Moon experience in the context of revitalizing the town's market/bazaar. The Bazaar takes place every weekend and you have a financial goal to meet with each Bazaar. While the gameplay is addictive as always doing your daily tasks, building up your farm, cooking skills, relationships, etc.. the real pleasure comes from gathering up everything you need for the week to sell at your booth (and consequently figuring out which items you can gather or make that have the highest selling value). It is also pleasing to get upgrades and do additional shopping for yourself at the Bazaar since you cannot find certain items/things outside of this event.There are also various events that take place throughout the calendar which you can participate in as well. Admittedly I don't really give a turd about the other townspeople (not worth the time and effort to me and the cookie cutter dialogue gets real old real fast) so I guess it's just about personal preference as to where you focus your energy. My girlfriend, for instance, went through all the time and trouble to get \"married\" in the game, only to have her \"husband\" stand around and do absolutely nothing just like he did as an NPC before.Multiplayer is a little cumbersome. There are not many options for this mode as you can't carry items while in multiplayer or outright exchange anything with other players. If you have animals they will not be present during this mode either (so you can't reap extra things like milk, eggs, or wool). Also, you can only bring 3 items along to sell to the other player (optionally at half price) at a kindof mini bazaar. You can however harvest crops from the Host players farm if they are ready. So this is where multiplayer is nice especially if both players are in a different season as this is a great opportunity to get a boatload of stuff you would otherwise not be able to get a hold of (seeds, cooking ingredients, etc...). Kindof a crapshoot but in the case of my gf and I it works out to be a nice system since we live together and can go into multiplayer anytime.Anyhow, in trying to not be too long winded- overall this is a franchise that is known for making titles that suck you in the same way the Sims franchise does- by making you think \"I'll just finish this one thing then go to bed\" and another three hours later you're saying it all over again. After the first couple years in the game, however, it can start to feel a little too repetitive with fewer milestones and new things to discover. I can't really comment on how this one compares to other titles, because there seem to be about a thousand of them and I don't like it THAT much. I remember having fun playing Friends of Mineral Town but that's about it which I suppose makes me more of a newcomer to the series. In that case I'd say this was pretty accessible and whatever other game information you need is just a Google search away.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Harvest Moon title for newcomers", "unixReviewTime": 1346025600, "reviewTime": "08 27, 2012"}

I was a bit put off by the release date being pushed back not once but twice - but the early shipping cheered me up a little.I've played pretty much all the HM games since the n64, and as sad as that is, I figured I would put this here for other fans of the series that were looking into this game.Pros:-Graphics are A+ for a DS game, seriously.-Love the art style.-You start out with a barn built and you don't have to clear your field. One of my biggest gripes about some of the other games was that they'd kinda throw you into it with 3 bags of turnips and you had to scrimp and save until you got a barn. Then scrimp and save until you got a chicken, etc.-You also start out with storage/cold storage to put your things in, but this also leads to a slight con.-YOU START WITH A KITCHEN. WHile you have to buy some of the stuff to go in it, no more waiting until 239490234 house upgrades to get a kitchen.-JUMPING. Seriously, so convenient. Oh hey a stream, LOL I CAN JUMP OVER IT! Also there are shortcuts around town, like jumping on a barrel near the cliff near your farmstead bounces you up and gives you faster access to the town, etc.-They finally got rid of mining. I realize some would find this a con but I hated mining so, so much. Oh how I hated it. And I hated having to waste an entire day trying to MAYBE find ONE gold ore so I could upgrade my equipment.-Your stamina depletes more slowly, and your house starts with a bathroom so you can replenish it a little. Also the house has a fireplace. SWANK!Cons:-Erm, the only tools you start with are a hoe and watering can. Granted, without mining and such it's not as essential to have the hammer, etc. but...still.-Unfortunately, crop quality is back and that means everything you pick up isn't going to stack unless it has the star rating. THey at least give you 2 bag menu screens at first for this but lol, one day's foraging will literally fill both screens up because one toy flower will have 1 star, another will have 1 and a half star so they don't stack, etc.-You can sell stuff during the week but it won't sell nearly as well as the stuff in the bazaar. The bazaar is only once a week. This means that all your money is totally incremental. I managed to make enough to buy a chick (3500 gold btw) at the first week's bazaar, but I can see this is going to be tedious. Also - you're selling stuff in your stall at the same time the townspeople are selling ESSENTIAL items you need. (Animals, upgrades, etc.)so if you want it you have to shut down your stall and go get it, losing money in the process. :\\ I realize the bazaar is the whole point of the game, but it would be so much nicer if it was twice a week. On some weeks a festival pushes it from Sat to Sun. And if you're out of money, no seeds for you until you can sell stuff for a decent price. The dude in the store that you can sell to every day will straight rip you off for stuff. I guess to make the bazaar seem more enticing but jeez. I guess that's where the difficulty of the game comes from.-Not exactly a stellar cast of characters. All the bachelors are pretty \"meh\" and the artist guy REALLY reminds me of David from Roseanne, therefore I can't even look at him without cringing in pity.-You can only save when you sleep. I hate, HATE this archaic type of game design. Monster Rancher DS fell to this flaw as well. So great, my dog sits on the power button and an entire day's work is lost. WOO!-I feel bad saying this, but there is very, very little to do. Play with your farm animals, run around and water your crops, say hi to townsfolk, give your bachelor/bachelorette a present, aaaaaaand you're done. And it's only 11am. So what do you do for the rest of the day? Catch bugs and fish I guess. Meh. THe problem is there's no underlying storyline besides, \"Make the bazaar a success!\" which in the early portions of the game is laughable. The dude sets your quota to like 15,000. Yeah, you're really gonna hit that with the 6 turnips you have to sell. Stock up for the next week and go with it. BUt otherwise there's no, \"Save the harvest goddess.\" etc. type stuff to do. Cook, catch bugs, water crops, pet animals, talk to people aaaaaand you're done. Go to bed at 1pm.In all I am not disappointed with this game. I think it is very pleasing and a great, dare I say, casual? harvest moon game. It's weird to call a game in a part of an already casual gaming series casual but...it's true. There's no stress. Sit back and enjoy selling your stuff and the festivals and whatall. Something to play after work or what-have-you. I'd say during a lunch break except lol you can't save without going to bed so it's not really, \"OH MAN I EMERGENCY I NEED TO TURN THIS OFF!\" friendly.Good? No. Decent? Yes. Bad? No. If a more relaxing HM game is what you want, this is for you. My main hope is that they import some of the designs (jumping, etc.) for later games.

This game is well worth the investment for people who played the last game.  It's not necessarily worth it for people who haven't played any AC games.Ezio Auditore is the main character of this well thought out game.  In Assassin's Creed II he started off as a fun loving teenager who seemed to have everything going for him until tragedy struck his family.  Ezio end up turning the tragedy into revenge and found out he was an elite assassin.  Their to take out this mysterious group that has control over religion and the government.  Like the first game the quest is to actually finding this object called the Apple of Eden.  The Apple is basically what holds all mysteries of life.  Needless to say the Assassin's aren't the only ones looking for this Apple.  The Templars are also trying to find this.  AC II takes you through most of Ezio's young adulthood.  Watching the transformation from teenager to a man with a mission makes the story compelling.In Assassin's Creed Brotherhood we now have Ezio continuing his mission.  The Apple that was shortly on his property has once again been taken by the Templars.  The story takes place in the turn of the 16th century Italy.  To be more precise Roma or Rome as it's known to us.  Although the back story which was generally pretty limited with Desmond Miles is actually advancing quite a bit.  What new players to the series may not understand is that this game does not just take place in the past, it also takes place two years in the future.  Ezio Auditore is the ancestor of Desmond Miles.  Desmond is now realizing that he is also part of a long line of Assassin's that are also in a present day fight against the Templars.  The Templars have all the money to invest in this fight to secure the Apple the Assassin's are limited.What makes this game remarkable is everything they added to it.  Sometimes it can get a little overwhelming.  Whereas the previous games had cities that were decent size as a player you had the option to complete certain parts of the game before you worked on the rest.  Now with Brotherhood you have the huge city of Rome.  Which is overwhelming but also beautiful.  If you are like me you may spend much of your time just exploring.  There are so many side missions it can literally add many hours unto your game play.  Although I would say for a big fan of the series they are almost a necessity.  Brotherhood takes everything from the previous games and one up's it.  It is easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of content.  Even building up the city can become quite a task.Multiplayer is the completely new element to this game and it is well worth it.  Unlike games like the Call of Duty series that is based on using guns to kill your enemy this game relies on close combat weapons.  The whole objective of multiplayer is to be stealth like and not get detected.  You are assigned as assassination target which can be one of several playable characters.  Which makes it more complicated it that there can be several characters that look the same which makes detection sometimes impossible.  If you can find your target without the target noticing you, you are awarded many points.  If you still manage to assassinate your target while being seen you will be awarded with a limited amount of points.  In my plays I found this addition to the game well worth it.  Although I did notice several players that generally play the online portion like they would the single player it only makes it more exciting.AC Brotherhood is an exciting sequel to AC II.  This game may have new players wondering what is going on and that is why I wouldn't generally advise this game to people just getting in the series.  AC II should be a pre-requisite.  Brotherhood has it's spots at times where you may be wondering what to do next.  The large city can be overwhelming and make travel tiring if you haven't invested in the underground tunnels.  This game is a must have for fans of the series.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A fitting sequel to Assassin's Creed II", "unixReviewTime": 1290297600, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2010"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "To someone like me who did not play the prequels, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a solid 5-star game. The goal is for you to save Rome (Roma) from the Borgia forces with a lot of help from historical characters such as Machiavelli and under full control from `the future' - that would be the present-day you helping the `you in the past' re-enact the past... it's complicated but it's fun playing it. In order to do this you have an arsenal of weaponry that can range from a small blade to a tank that can clear out dozens of enemies. And, if you really want to know what's going on or rather what went on, there is a massive in-game database that holds a lot of information about the buildings and the places you see and the historical characters you interact with. But... yes, the plot.You must find the location of the apple of Eden in modern time (present) and, of course, save the world but, in order to find this information you need to live the life of Ezio of the 13th century. There is this machine called the Animus which allows you to access the memories of your ancestors. If you are able to survive through part of his Ezio's life you will find the path to the item that was able to save Rome and will help you save the present day world. Of course, LOTS must die if the world is to be saved and, as a professional assassin, it's going to be you or your allies responsible for all that creative killing. But the cause just - saving the world and getting rid of those bad Borgia guys - and Machiavelli makes it clear that achieving a good goal justifies any means. Well... you better believe that if you want to feel good about whatever it is that you are doing in the game :)You are assigned very specific missions but while playing you can do whatever you choose to in-between missions. While playing, you can choose to engage multiple enemies at once that can give you the feeling of split second action scenarios - a rush that not many games can compete with and, remember, it's all done for a good cause. Not only is the fighting well made, the climbing also has a very nice feel to it. In the beginning of the game climbing may cause little thought at all, but as you progress you are forced to keep your mind open and look for those hand and foot holds that are keeping you from falling to your death. Creativity is a key part of the game and it will stretch to its limits if you are to play the game well.Sometimes when you get bored of playing on the campaign you can play with your friends on multiplayer and compete in a variety of game modes that usually involve you assassinating other people or you avoiding it.  Some of the multiplayer game modes are cooperative and slow, while others are a free for all and can lead to fierce competition and last-second wins. If you really want to test your reaction time, and mental skills, multiplayer is the place to do it.`Brotherhood' comes with a remarkably good if not morally compelling story line and I appreciated the huge amount of historical information that can be accessed at any time in the story mode and helps placing everything within its historical context. And those who don't necessarily agree with the Machiavellic views on morality (I don't) may still enjoy a very-well made game when it comes with combat and tactics and graphically stunning even for a PS3. While not a particularly long game in the story mode, you should be able to spend many more exciting, fun-filled extra hours in the multiplayer universe.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Morally... different, technically brilliant, a lot of fun to play", "unixReviewTime": 1296432000, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2011"}

The main storyline was done in about a week and I've been doing a lot of the extra stuff ever since.There isn't much of a difference graphics-wise but then there didn't really need to be. The game play itself though is vastly improved. You can now travel from section to section on the map, without having to deal with a loading screen. Also, the fighting mechanics are much more fun. Taking on a horde of guards doesn't mean losing all your health anymore. Also, you can recruit other assassins and call upon them to assist you in your battles. The missions aren't frustratingly, annoyingly difficult anymore. Even a casual gamer can beat the storyline with not too many retries if they focus on the task at hand and pick up on the mechanics fairly easily.Thee were only a couple things that disappointed me. The first is, they haven't gotten rid of the Tomb Raider aspect of the game, where you have to climb these indoor structures to find items and stuff. Also, the game's ending is open, leaving room for another sequel. Not that I have a problem with that per se but I was hoping for more closure than what you got when the credits rolled.The game is truly the best in the series thus far.

{"reviewerID": "A3O1KC19TDMFV3", "asin": "B003L8DXOI", "reviewerName": "Alexander Ayers", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "From my video game review blog:  [...]Ezio Auditore di Firenze is back for his second adventure, and the third Assassin's Creed game from Ubisoft.  While his mission was complete in his mind at the end of Assassin's Creed II, a few of his confidantes didn't think so.  The additon of a few new Borgia members, most notably Cesare, become the main villians.  I actually purchased this game first, before the first two games in the series, but waited a few months to try out the single player as I had never played an Assassin's Creed game before.  It always seemed so daunting and seemed like there were too many actions to perform and not enough buttons and the game too vast.  Once I got the hang of the multiplayer, I gave the single player a try.After debating a while, even though I had heard you didn't need to play the previous iterations, I purchased and completed the first two games, aptly titled: Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed II.  I'm really glad I did, as it added more to the whole experience of Brotherhood through some inside jokes and older characters returning.  I would recommend at least playing ACII, before Brotherhood.I was a big Altair fan from the beginning, so I was a bit disappointed when Ezio was introduced.  In fact, even after completing Assassin's Creed II (platinum trophy!) he still hadn't won me over.  So when I popped in my Brotherhood disc, I was expecting to be a little disappointed.  Needless to say, Ezio really won me over with this game (the Assasssin's Creed: Revelations E3 trailer helped a bit too).GameplayAfter being dropped in a battle scene where you need to just press buttons, Brotherhood opens with you replaying the final moments from Assassin's Creed II, in which Ezio must escape with his Uncle Mario.  The game quickly returns to Monteriggioni, which had changed a bit, however, with a few simple memories to make sure you still remember how to control Ezio, the main game begins.  The quaint town is quickly under attack, so Ezio and friends need to escape.After a brief interlude with Desmond, Lucy and the 2012 crew, the game, then turns its sights to Rome.  After AC II, with all of the different towns to visit, I was a bit surprised to see Brotherhood only featuring one city.  This is definitely the Liberty City version of Rome, which seems absolutely huge (makes Florence seem like Forli).  Within Rome, however, there are nicer parts, poorer parts, and even countryside settings, which reminded me of the original Assassin's Creed game, with the variations.The missions are what you'd expect, however I loved the variety in Brotherhood.  It wasn't all about the killing.  Two words sum up why this game is the best in the series:  Full Synchronization.  Someone not as enamored with the AC series could still enjoy this game, but potential \"couch assassin's\" get so much more out of it.  Each mission could be completed how the user preferred and still progress through the story, but those who take their games seriously could opt to carry out the mission the way Ezio would, and achieve Memory Full Synchronization. This could mean do the mission in a certain time limit, use a particular weapon, don't be detected, don't use the roof, don't kill anyone, etc.  The first time I only achieved 50% synchronization on a memory sequence, I immediately paused and restarted the mission, sometimes multiple times (you know who you are \"Hell on Wheels\").This game is loaded with optional side missions, as well.  There are still the Tomb Raideresque missions (this time called Follower's of Romulus Lairs - which are worth it for the bonus after they are all completed), the search for Subject 16's video, feathers to collect (only 10 this time), Borgia flags (101, but you can purchase maps), the usual contracts (Assassination, Courtesan, Thieves), Guild Challenges (Assassination, Courtesan, Thieves), and the capturing of Borgia Towers under command from a Borgia leader (Some fight, others run and hide, leaving you to wait until a guard shift change to challenge them again) . The addition of the crossbow, throwing multiple knives at a time, Leonardo missions (where you try out some of his inventions - Renaissance tanks!), and horseback riding as it should be, make things even more interesting and enjoyable.But, what would the game be without a Brotherhood of assassins?  For every Borgia Tower toppled, you can recruit one assassin (male or female, even).  These can then be trained (by being sent on missions in other places) and upgraded with better armor and weapons until they reach the ultimate ranking of assassin.  When the assassins are needed, they can be called upon to help you battle forces or dispose of foes without you being spotted or bothered.  They also have a power called arrow storm, which releases a flurry of arrows out of nowhere into multiple targets in your vicinity.  While the training of recruits was quite basic, as you had to pick proper missions to send them, resulting in experience points and subsequent leveling up, they certainly come in handy.The story progresses nicely, with even a few surprises thrown in.  Ezio is one determined dude, but you do get to see a softer side of him as he matures, especially when it's not all about the assassinations.  Where it does seem to lag, is unfortunately in the 2012 sections.  The interactions between Desmond and Lucy seemed forced, while Shaun is even more irritating than before.  Plus, guiding Desmond around, seems to lack much of the fluidity that Ezio posesses.  At least those sections are few and far between.  Yes, I did achieve 100% Synchronization in all missions, including every side mission, and often liked just roaming around finding treasures, flags, etc, so that my 55 hours invested in the game, really felt like around half of that.The fact that this game finally has multiplayer, has to be mentioned.  The fact that it is actually very good definitely deserves higher praise.  Multiplayer in Brotherhood is a totally different experience than I'm used to.  There are a variety of modes, some where you're on your own (Wanted), and some where you're part of a small team (Alliance, Manhunt).  Anyone looking for a run and stab kind of game should look elsewhere.  The mulitplayer modes do a great job of mirroring the single player experience, but kicked up a few notches.  It's all about blending in and sneaking around.  In Wanted, you're searching for your target, but are also being targeted by one or more of your opponents.  The more obscure your kill, the more points you'll get.  This is a game where you need to sit up and concentrate!In Manhunt, for example, for one round, you and your teammates are the hunters, but in the next round become the hunted.  Any mode I've played definitely gets the blood pumping.  It does have to be noted that actually getting into a multiplayer game can be tortuous.  Sometimes it connects with the correct amount of users and the game starts right up, but more often than not, you are waiting 15-20 minutes before you get a full group of 6 or 8.  Extremely frustrating, to say the least.  It's tough going at the beginning being lower leveled, but once you get to level 29 (poison is now an option), I would think things pick up (I'm currently at level 25).GraphicsThe cities are quite detailed, but often a little repetitive.  If you don't mind that kind of thing (I didn't), you'll be fine.  I did like the differences in regions, from the buildings, to the clothes the people wore.  There is, however, quite a bit of pop-up when on a horse.  I didn't notice it so much at the beginning of the game, but later on when I was trying to avoid certain groups of troops, all of a sudden a guy would pop in on top of a building's roof.  I'm not really a huge graphics person and I was so immersed in the story, that it wasn't a game killer.SoundThe city is vibrant with sound, ranging from people getting annoyed that you ran into them, to those mystified by your agile grace, and the return engagement of those annoying minstrels (which I just tackled this time around).  Also, the score does pick up, especially in tense moments, with the correct mood music.Replay ValueThere is A TON to do in this game, especially if you'd like FULL SYNCHRONIZATION on all missions, and the additional sidequests.  I'd say a quick run through might take around 15 hours, and going for everything around 30-40 hours (or my 55 hours).  Quite a lot, I think.  Ubisoft could have just put out a filler game for half of that.  The multiplayer adds infinite replay, in my opinion.  That is when you get connected.RATING:9As enjoyable a game as I've come across, although I am an AC fanboy.

REcovering in Mottrogionni, Ezio is badly wounded during a surprise attack but the papal forces under Cesare and the Borgia flag. Fleeing his home, Ezio heads for Rome, determined to bring down the juggernaut of the Church and its corrupted allies. Along the way, he rebuilds the Assassins Guild of Italy and Rome itself.AC:B still earns the gold medal for graphics. Whats provided are about ten square miles of the city, and includes many famous landmarks and rather nice background info on a lot of them, for the history buffs who're curious about that stuff. The only down side is by carrying such a huge load for grpahics, loading times tend to lag a noticeable amount. NPC's wink into existence at a close distance before beginning their macro activities, and its somewhat easy to stumble into spawning group of guards. Also included is the present day Mottrogionni, which can be explored by Desmond, who finally has the ability to get up and stretch his legs as needed.Audio also gets a gold medal again. Well written, interesting dialogue, believable and well-voiced characters, and enough background speeches and dialogue that you pretty much only here repeats from the annoyed peasants you crash into.Gameplay is pretty much how you remember it. Actual assassinations are a tad difficult, as you can't move at faster than a brisk walk without alerting guards to your presence, and high profile targets are usually kept surrounded by more guards than the President. But there are so many other options you won't notice or care. You can summon you Assassin initiates to take them out, you can shoot them with pistol or crossbow, poison other guards to nail them in the swinging, or just wage through the ranks, as you're still a elite killer with years of experience.Major improvements abound. You can reload earlier memories, a major annoyance from the prior game. Combat is a lot slicker and more offensive, as you can chain together kills without waiting to counter every opponent. Modern day story is vastly expanded, and its worthwhile to get out and wander around. Puzzles for \"The Truth\" are a lot of fun still, and more creepily delivered. Probably the only let downs are some carry overs from the last game, namely the chase scenes, where you're constantly 3 feet behind your target until the finish line.The third iteration is by far the best.

I'm HOOKED to the series. When this title was announced I was a bit dismayed to find out it continued the adventures of Ezio Auditore da Firenze. I personally felt that his story arc was over and done with, and that UBI should have moved to the next of Miles' assassin's ancestors.  I can understand why UBI would be quick to cash in on Ezio Auditore: he is an incredibly sympathetic character (compared to Altar Ibn La'Ahad,  a mangy dog would come off as more sympathetic) and the Italy of the Medicis proved to be an incredibly fun setting for a game.It just seemed to me that aside from the DLC which I have yet to play, the story of Ezio was over. So this title felt like shameless cashing in, I felt like it would be fluff.I then read that the greater story arc set in present day, detailing the struggle between the Assassin's and the Templars is somewhat progressed in this game,and there seems to be a twist at the end, so, begrudgingly, I bit and bought this game. So far, I am incredibly let down.Now, this game is the most polished of all Assassin's Creed. The gameplay has finally hit its stride. The swordfighting, I feel, has finally answered the various claims that it was dull and repetitious. By including a variety of enemies as well as new weapons, and the ability to call upon your underlings, not to mention that enemies now will not (always) wait around until you dispatch one of their own to take a hack at you, UBI has effectively replicated swashbuckling in all its glory, I feel. There's a lot less of the old \"jump exactly the opposite direction I intended Altar/Ezio to jump\" that plagued the first two titles. UBI also added a feature to allow you to hotkey any four weapons/actions to the dpad, which I thought added more guesswork to your preference, but it also adds the element of 'on-the-fly' that Assassin's Creed 2 sometimes lacked.  I do take issue with the horses in this game though. They kinda gallop at a lumbering pace. It could be said that it's because you're within Roma...well, what about on the outskirts? I dunno. One of my favorite things to do in the first two games was ride around, and get a sense of speed. Small issue, to be sure.The graphics are as lush as Assassin's Creed II. I can't fault it for being exactly the same as before, seeing as how Assassin's Creed II was a very beautiful game, and still quite recent.The soundtrack of the game is essentially the same, although I will say: there's a feature in the game that allows you to burn down watch towers to reclaim control of Roma in sections; whenever this happen, a dark, sinister theme would play. First few times it played, it was pretty cool. After the 5th or 6th time, it got old. Don't know why. The voice acting in this game is pretty uneven, in comparison to Assassin's Creed II. In ACII, the voice acting within the Animus was I would say top notch, if a bit comical at first. Outside the animus it was horrifyingly bad.  This time around, the voice acting within the animus is some of the worst I've seen this gen, whereas the voice acting for the present day Assassin's was better, I feel.As I've mentioned, this game introduces some new features, which I feel add to the gameplay in very refreshing ways. For one thing, you embark on rebuilding Roma, and reclaim it from the Borgia. You do this by capturing towers (sort of like the view points in the first two games), which normally entails killing a squad commander and then setting the tower on fire. Aside from the dark theme issue I already mentioned, this was probably my favorite addition to the gameplay.  As you recapture more and more sections of Roma, you are able to renovate quite a number of things in the city: You can renovate shops, such as blacksmiths, art vendors and tailors, just like in ACII. You can also renovate doctor stands this time around, as well as  well as stables, where you would be able to pick up a horse, and banks, where you can pick up your future deposits. You are also able to renovate entrances  to the underground catacombs, which are then used as 'fast-travel' hubs in the city, derelict buildings which you can use as headquarters for either of your three allied factions (courtesans, thieves and mercenaries),  and historical points of interest, such as the acueduct and the Colosseum.  All these renovations of course bolster your money-generating capacity; the more you renovate, the more you earn. This was done to bolster what was considered as a flimsy economy in ACII.  All it really does in my opinion is prolong the inevitable: that given enough grind, Ezio will have enough florins  to fund a crusade or cure the bubonic plague. I've yet to renovate absolutely everything, but I have not found myself in need of picking pockets.Another addition is the introduction of your assassin brethren. This is a great addition, but it gets old fast, and it actually becomes a crutch that the game, I feel, abuses.  You rescue rebellious romans from the clutches of Borgia's men, and induct them as acolytes of the Assassin's. These newbs you can level up two ways: by either calling them into battle, where they will aid you with their great, or lacking, prowess. You can also simply grind assassin contracts.  This is the safest way to level your assassins, and it's a great way to come by loads of cash, and special items. You simply select a mission, select up to five assassini to send, and voila, just wait until they report back to you (sort of like jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics) The more assassins you send on an assignment, the less exp each one gets. After some exp, they will go up a rank, up to the 10th rank, where they go through the rituals of becoming actual assassins. When you have enough assassins, at least six, you can call an 'arrow storm':  your assassins will dispatch every enemy in the vicinity with unseen crossbows. This is pretty cool, although it feels cheap, but the cooldown is a lengthy one, so that offsets the 'awesome cheapness'  effect.  Otherwise, you can call upon your assassins three times consecutively, in groups of two. Your assassins level pretty fast and once they reach the level cap, they're pretty much indestructable, as long as you make sure you don't send them on suicide missions (and the mission will tell you the probability of success before starting, so it's a sure thing). You can recruit as many as 12 assassins, so once you get closer to that maximum, the whole recruiting  new assassins is another grind. And, again, it's a great source of money and special items. These special items you can use to either sell them or as requirements for 'shop quests'- the vendors will often require special items to unlock certain special items, armor and weapons.  This was also a welcome and refreshing addition, albeit, a bit difficult to complete thus far.The biggest draw I would say is the multiplayer. There are no words to describe how FUN the MP is. I would say the experience is comparable to when Modern Warfare came out. It just blows you out of the water. I played one mode so far, Wanted. You basically have to find and execute your target, and you rack up points for the finesse with which you accomplish this.  Of course, the twist is, you are also the hunted. I had my concerns of how a game where everyone is trying to stab everyone else in the back would work. The answer is, beautifully. You basically have to become an expert in subterfuge, and learn how to blend in,  and not act erratically so as not to stand out. This is harder than it sounds. It's incredibly addicting, and nerve wracking. I would say the MP is the games shiniest prospect.Which brings me to why  I'm not giving this game full marks.  First off, the story, so far, is INCREDIBLY weak. Aside fromt he political intrigue and tidbits of what seems like true speculative Renaissance history, the story itself lacks SO MUCH of what the first two games had, that I feel I'm basically plodding through  to the end, so I can call it good and wait for ACIII. You attempt to retake Roma from the Borgia and his demented children. Ok. Um. And what does this mean for the greater arc of the game? With such a huge revelation at the end of ACII, why is this even relevant? Well, the game takes the time to explain why they are revisiting Ezio's past, but the reasons are so flimsy, it just screams ka-ching.  So you go around eliminating personages of some importance to the Pope, and you uncover yet another plot of intrigue. It just doesn't feel cohesive though. Another set of missions have you working for Leonardo DaVinci, who asks you to destroy his inventions, comissioned by the Pope under pain of death; these missions, I feel, made at least some sense of WHY you were doing what you were doing. There was also a subplot of a secret sect, the Followers of Romulus, who don wolf-skins and live as wolves ( a far cry of the Cynics?  I don't think UBI would have made that allusion intentionally) which feels, in all earnest, a bit disjointed from the rest of the storyline.Finally, my biggest issue with the game is the mission mechanics. First off, this game is a direct continuation of ACII, and I would dare say it would be extremely difficult for a newcomer to simply pick up and play ACBR without any issues.  The gameplay, and controls, are largely the same, and that's good, I feel.  They did however set to make more varied missions, as this was one of the bigger complaints of AC and in a lesser way, of ACII. The result however, is a string of escort missions, of missions with obscure directives (Such as, kill the guards up ahead, but don't stray too far, but don't let the guards get too close, but don't let anyone see you kill the guards...in fact, just use your assassins, but again, don't get too close....) or missions with exacting auto-fails (you were seen? Fail. You stumbled? Fail. You fought? Fail) In the beginning, the game gives you a bonus (full synchronization) if you fulfill the mission within certain parameters, but later in the game, you fail a mission for reasons which oftentimes remained a mistery: I've had to fail missions repeatedly to find out WHY I was failing in the first place. Basically, the game does a lousy job of telling you what to do.  And this is a departure, for the worse in my opinion, of the formula of the first two games. The first two games would allow you to accomplish missions in whichever way, some of which were incredibly graceless and brutish.  This time around, you are left to divinate the ONE way to complete a mission.I really hope that ACIII, whenever it comes out, does not take the exact same approach.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Frustrating fake sequel", "unixReviewTime": 1296604800, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2011"}

Their are too many area restrictions which keeps you doing the story mode more often and becomes boring which leads me to find gold by killing soldiers which leads to point 1. 3. Finally, I can say the Variety of weaponary is much more diversed with cannons to crossbows and all the old skills are still enabled into the game. This might make the game hard for  those who hasn't caught on using the fighting skills from Assassin's Creed 1 and 2.3. The open environments are much nicer and makes the game more real with riding a horse in the cities and enabling yourself to buy buildings.

Rome is so huge that there is probley much more to buy then even what's in the villa from Assassin's Creed 2.4.

{"reviewerID": "A2DZK4B2FTFCQZ", "asin": "B003L8DXOI", "reviewerName": "D. Blizzard", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "The Assassin's Creed story continues with this direct sequel to Assassin's Creed 2 (AC2).  Again, you are placed in the role of Ezio.  Instead of going from city to city in search of your targets, you remain within the city of Rome.  Assassin's Creed Brotherhood adds some new elements and changes some things around a bit for yet another great game in the saga.Story:  The story of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood picks up directly following the events in AC2.  Due to various events, Ezio finds his way to Rome and seeks to undermine the efforts of the delusional Cesare Borgia and his scheming family.  As with the previous game in the franchise, the story here is deep and the characters memorable.  Caterina Sforza also makes a reappearance, but isn't quite as vulgar as she was in AC2, which is a bit of a disappointment.  The character Lucrezia Borgia is also introduced, and, although she is an antagonist, she is one of the most compelling and tragic characters in the game.  It is not quite as long or as deep as AC2, but it is certainly better than most.The visual style of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is very similar to that of AC2, it is Italy and done within the same time period, after all.  The difference here is that Rome is ancient, filled with ruins, so unpainted brick or marble is available for you to climb on.  The stunning chapel climbing sequences are mostly gone, in favor of the ruins, so you rarely get to see the fine, ornate, detail that Renaissance Italy was known for, but certain areas are the city are beautiful to look at.  As someone who enjoys the history of the Roman Empire, and yes Byzantium is included in that too, setting the story in Rome was a treat.  As soundtracks go, this is also well done.  Some of the tracks sound like they belong in the HBO series \"Rome\" and use vocals quite a bit.Gameplay:  Put simply, the gameplay in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood mostly mirrors that of AC2.  There are several new additions that further refine the gameplay, making it even better, mostly, than the previous installments.  If you enjoyed rebuilding and upgrading Monteriggioni in AC2, Rome has got you covered.  You can open a number of shops to heal you, make weapons and armor, dye clothes, and paintings.  There are other structures you open, like banks, landmarks, aqueducts, stables, a fast-travel tunnel system, and guild buildings.  All of these provide gameplay benefits and net you cash every 20 minutes.  Open every building, and you get a very useful cape.  It would have been nice if, in renovating all structures in a given area, that area would become more noticeably better, but as it stands, the difference is very subtle.In Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, there is also the new guild system.  There are three main guilds, thieves, courtesans, and mercenaries, along with an additional assassin's guild you control directly.  The three primary guilds give you side quests and a challenge board.  Complete every challenge and the guild owner will give you a special item.  Individual side quests open over time as you progress through the game.  The assassin's guild is very interesting, you recruit assassin's from Rome's population to fight for your cause.  These assassin's level up and can be sent out on missions or used to help you in a fight by providing backup or to rain arrows down on your enemies.  Although the assassin's guild is fun, once they reach the maximum levels, there really isn't much for them to do except sending them out on the difficult \"starred\" assassin missions, which net not only florins but also rare items, or calling them into battle.  You do not have access to your assassin's guild during certain gameplay sequences where they would be most useful, but you can use them fairly often.The full synchronization concept is also introduced.  In previous installments, you get a mission telling you to do something, it is then up to you to determine the best method to accomplish this.  In Brotherhood, you still have that option, but if you accomplish the mission in a certain way, you synchronize more fully.  As your overall synchronization meter fills, you gain special memories from earlier events.  These memories are triggered at various benchmarks, such as 30% overall synchronization all the way up to 75%.  Mercifully, the developers stopped at 75% knowing that not everyone has the patience to go much beyond that.  Keep in mind that if you fail the full synchronization requirement, and the game will certainly let you know this, and decide to suicide yourself to back to the checkpoint prior to the event you failed, you will still have failed in the requirement.  If you want to try it again, you have to restart the mission entirely from the beginning.Everything starts at the Borgia towers which dot the landscape.  These break Rome up into several zones, some of which are totally inaccessible for arbitrary reasons not connected to the story.  To get new assassin recruits and access to buildings, you must dispatch the captain of the tower and then burn it to the ground.  Each captain is given a star rating which is meaningless if you played any previous installment of Assassin's Creed.  The rating is supposed to indicate difficulty, but, I was able to take down a five-star tower the moment it became available when Ezio first entered Rome without guild backup.  Removing the towers removes a certain number guards or makes them weaker in that zone.One of the most talked about additions to the franchise is the inclusion of multiplayer.  There are several multiplayer game modes to choose from.  Alliance is where the six players are split into three teams, all sent to hunt other teams.  Team work is crucial in alliance.  Man hunt is another mode, where two teams take turns being both the hunter and the hunted.  Wanted is a mode where you are assigned targets, often other players, and you go assassinate them as solo agents.  There is a spin-off to the wanted mode, and that is advanced wanted where gameplay is shifted forcing a more stealthy approach as the compass, which points you to your target, is reduced in effectiveness.  Players can choose from a number of characters to play as, all of which are generic in appearance, allowing the players to blend in with crowds more easily, or even stand next to an identical non-playable character to throw off would-be assassins.  The whole system is ranked up to level 50 with bonuses at each level, and you gain points for stealth on top of simply killing the target.  This is used to discourage players from merely running around killing everything since the points gained just killing are relatively low compared to the bonuses given for actually being an assassin.There are other minor tweaks to the gameplay.  You now have shop quests which require you to scour fallen enemies and treasure chests for rare items that can be combined to make new equipment.  There really is no real reason to get paintings or buy every piece of weapon and armor in the game since there are no completion benefits or trophies in doing this.  The annoying flag mini-game makes a return, but with a twist.  Some of the flags are hidden the Romulus lairs, which are similar to the assassin's seal quest that ultimately yielded the Armor of Altair in AC2.  These lairs can be tricky to navigate, so it is likely you will miss one or two flags.  Completing these lairs grants Ezio the Armor of Brutus and Dagger of Brutus, which are both the best armor and short weapon in the game, unique in many respects.  The dagger is very useful, civilians and enemies sometimes cower and the animations using it draw upon how Brutus killed Cesar with vicious stabs, being both effective and brutal.  Da Vinci also makes a return, giving you a parachute if you destroy the war machines he is contracted, forced, to build.  These are fun mini-games allowing Ezio to take control of tanks, naval cannon's, and bomber aircraft.  Brotherhood also introduces execution's.  If Ezio counters or kills an enemy, he can follow through and cause a one hit kill on any nearby enemy, even brutes.  The trick is to know which enemy is going to attack next and kill them before they hit you, stopping the execution.  If you pull off the execution, you can follow it though to another enemy, and another, and another, without anything stopping you other than an enemy breaking your streak with a hit.Misc.:  Assassin's Creed 2 was considered my game of the year for 2009 and I believed Brotherhood would join it in 2010.  Sadly, this was not the case for a few minor reasons.  AC2 is a deep game with plenty of story elements to keep the player engaged for many hours.  Brotherhood is similar, but not quite as deep, only going as far as nine memory segments.  With few exceptions, the side missions assigned by the various guilds are very similar with little to add to the story, nor do they form small story arcs encouraging you to play them all.  The rebuilding of Rome is also fun, for a while.  You do gain discounts and new items in opening up shops, but, aside from this, nothing really changes all that much to the city.  Hearing the populace talk about Ezio or the assassin's more, the buildings being cleaned up, or even flying the assassin's or the Auditore flag, similar to how they flew at Monteriggioni, would have been nice.  This would give the feeling that the assassin's were tipping the balance in Rome.The assassin's guild is also very useful and fun, but, Ezio's guild seems very separate from the game with none of the missions bleeding over into the main game.  It would be nice had Ezio been given direct involvement in some of the missions, or if he could lead a team on special missions.  As it stands now, the guild doesn't really have much impact on the story with the exception of a few memories.  In fact, you could recruit people and not bother to use them at all in the game and not lose much.  The guild of assassin's can be useful as backup or to rain arrows down on your enemies, but I found myself rarely needing them, especially after leveling them up, which is quite easy.The main issue that kicked the game a few notches down on my \"Game of 2010\" list centers around multiplayer.  I usually don't play multiplayer, it gets repetitive too quickly and there is nothing affecting the game's canon in it.  Although there are a number of modes and character archetypes to try, it does get old.  Moreover, unless you have several friends you can invite, you will be stuck with a least one person not acting stealthily, racing from rooftop to rooftop to get the next kill.  It often seems as though many players are trying to take a multiplayer shooter strategy, which is get the most kills, and apply it to a unique multiplayer experience that discourages this type of gameplay.  This makes multiplayer less fun since the whole point of being an assassin is to kill without being seen until the last possible moment.  I would have liked a Demon's Souls multiplayer mode where you can bring in other gamers to help in some cases, or, have them hunt you down in the single player game  should something go wrong in a mission.  Instead of outright failing a mission if you are detected, a player could appear in the city and hunt you, even after you completed the main assassination.  I would have found this type of multiplayer more compelling.It should also be noted that this game has multiplayer trophies.  You could squeeze every last bit out of the single player experience, even hunting down the irritating flags, and still not get the platinum trophy unless you invest almost as much time in multiplayer as you did in single player.  As someone who often does not play multiplayer or find it enjoyable, this is a major let down.  I probably would have gone back after finishing game to get the more difficult trophies had multiplayer trophies not been added, but since they were, why bother?  For a mostly single player game in a single player franchise, these multiplayer trophies should have been removed in favor of bonuses in single player campaigns or just stripped entirely as a stand-alone feature granting UPlay points.Overall, in the single player game, it is an improvement in terms of mechanics.  Expanding the rebuilding game and adding in the assassin's guild was a fun addition, but it really doesn't do much to change the game.  The full synchronization concept is interesting and there are rewards for doing it.  Thankfully, the developers make it goal to get full sync, but set it up so unless the player actively ignores doing it, it is almost certain they will get the reward for completion.  The war machines side missions are very fun and I would like to see more.  The hecklers have also been toned down a bit and thief races are few.  Overall, it is a great game and a worthy addition to the franchise, but, for me, it just wasn't as good as Assassin's Creed 2 if only by a tiny amount.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Assassin's Creed 2.5", "unixReviewTime": 1294012800, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2011"}

I alluded to this problem briefly in a previous Assassin's Creed review of mine, but the controls in Brotherhood really SUCK. It is in this particular AC title that the control scheme's failings are truly emphasized. Specifically, I'm talking about the combat controls.  When you're trying to take over the Borgia Towers, you're often bombarded with tons of enemies on screen at once.  Besides the fact that I've noticed a significant drop in frame rate, there's a problem trying to disarm enemies.  Normally (and what the game tells you to do), you have to select the fist icon, target your enemy, hold the counter button (R1) and press the disarm button at the right time.  Why didn't this work at all with the spear-holding and axe-carrying enemies????  It did in Assassin's Creed 2!!  What was the problem here??  There's absolutely no way to disarm these enemies, and I've tried to research this in quite a few walkthroughs.  Even when trying to counter, you STILL take damage.  My guess is that it's a major glitch in the game.I'm not even going to go into the jumping/wall-climbing controls.  They still kept those the same from previous titles, and that needs serious work.  When you want Ezio to jump one way, he goes in another direction.  It's ridiculous!Whatever the case may be, the disarming element made me erupt in extreme frustration, and I proceeded to forcefully quit my game and delete all Assassin's Creed files on my PS3 hard drive.  I happened to obtain a pirated copy of AC Revelations (the newest title in this now-defunct series) for the Xbox 360, but I'm not even going to bother playing it.As a result, I am going to trade this game in, as well as the previous two AC titles, to Amazon this week.  I would much rather salvage some of my money back and let someone else buy my used copy so that Ubisoft never gets any profit from the sale of a new copy.Never in my life have I experienced such a poorly designed combat control scheme for a video game...especially since the previous game in the series was almost perfect!

Pavlenko", "helpful": [15, 17], "reviewText": "To start off the developer of this game has stated greatly this is not a full fledged sequel but more of a part 2 to Assassin's Creed 2. Knowing this when purchasing this game will greatly help the overall enjoyment of the game with out raising the expectations factor beyond achievement. So what im saying is to go in expecting to finish off Assassin's Creed 2 and you'll be greatly pleased. As with most of my reviews I post the pros and cons and my opinion at top while keeping the in depth review lower.Personal Opinion: If you loved Assassins Creed 2 there is absolutely no reason you should not like or enjoy this game. I would also greatly suggest playing AC2 before starting this game if your new to the series. If youve played them all i would also suggest warming up on AC2 for a few hours just be reminded of all the work put into the villa and the character growth of Ezio... some of you will understand why.On a side note I my connection on my ps3 is to low to play any multiplayer matches due to the snow so I will edit my review with the addition of my opinions of online if i deem it necessary.Pros:1. Slightly refined combat making for a more offensive approach2. Economic scale much higher than what the Villa was and balanced3. The feeling of a badass has been upped4. Having apprentices and watching them descend upon a group of guards like a pack of wolves5. Secondary objectives provide challenges for some missions6. Length of game if your a completionist7. Almost everything is optional8. Bringing your horse inside the city and calling it with a whistle like in Red Dead Redemption9. Conquering that what the hell how am i gonna climb this feeling10. Desmond has grown some finallyCons:1. The camera and its positioning behind objects during fights on occasion2. Buying some large landmarks for a steep price only to find out they provide very little income3. Overshooting that one ledge and dying4. The larger number of do not be detected missions can be somewhat annoying for some5. Losing an apprentice6. Having to wait to take over all of Rome due to that stupid wall that unlocks as you progress through the story7. That what the hell how am i gonna climb this feeling and having it for nearly half an hour (personal problem)8. Desmonds getting fat...GAMEPLAY:Overall you still play as Ezio Auditore and he handles generally the same. While some of the moves appear to have changed everything will be like picking Assassin's Creed 2 back up and going at it. Youll run and jump between buildings,judging distances on the fly, and making those leaps of faith on the fly as been one of the core mechanics as to any entry in this series. One of the more dramatic changes is without a doubt the chain kills. when dealing out a killing blow to an enemy you can aim the analog stick in the direction of another opponent and a click of the attack button will allow you to automatically kill him. Even though it may sound a bit easy at first, but enemies like most games can end your chain kills by hitting you, dodging, or being to far away. It makes for a slight challenge to string together a long killstreak but ultimately more satisfying. While one poor mans review of this game who gave it two stars complained about enemies still taking turns at attacking I have noticed they are not as hesitant now and will swing in at any chance. Weapons are generally the same with the inclusion of a crossbow working generally as a stealth kill pistol. In a personal opinion I still prefer the hidden blades and short swords/daggers due to their more brutal nature and speed at which you can slice kills together.Rome is huge and the fast travel networks is a necessary addition as well as the ability to use a horse inside the walls. Taking out Borgia towers works as both view points as well as unlocking building's for sale. There are separate view points as well. Romulus lairs instead of Assassin's tombs or to replace them i should say but they still unlock a the most powerful armor in the game.APPRENTICES:Generally the apprentices are just a gameplay addition but I am giving them a separate section just due to having to put work into them. If your like me and get attached to something you've put work into you'll enjoy the apprentices just due to the separate leveling and watching them swarm your target while you watch from a roof after signaling them with the left trigger. They are my favorite addition by far and work somewhat like a pack of wolves stalking a small group of deer. They attack out of nowhere and are ruthless and their efficiency only gets deadlier as you progress them through contracts in foreign areas. You can send a number of apprentices to one of many foreign major cities to complete one of many contracts with a range of difficulties. As they level up their efficiency gets higher making the more effective at difficult contracts. If you want to level up the recently recruited civilian who was being oppressed by a group of guards till you intervened you can send them with a higher ranked assassin who has a much higher chance to succeed on a difficult mission making for a large bonus to the newbie. When they are not out doing contracts they will be in Ezio's hideout ready to assists you on your command. The more recruits you have the more Assassins you can call in to aid you at any point. To many guards hold down the trigger longer to allow for a hail of very precise arrows that will clear the street. Having difficulty getting to a target call in back up to either deal with the guards or take out the target themselves. Its all extremely self explanatory in the game but watching these little devils wipe a room clean while you are watching in the distance is extremely satisfying.ECONOMY101:If you completed the Villa in AC2 you will get a much larger scale this time around with Rome as a whole. You can purchase a large number of stores/businesses this time around but bring in much less money so collecting large numbers of those stores is necessary. You wont find yourself with an endless supply of money till much later on and closer to the finale rather than halfway. Pouches have received a large price increase as a side note so expect to drop some serious cash.TIP- Make sure your carrying at least 4000 florins as some missions require large amounts of money.STORY:Do not expect any large plot reveals either as 90% of the story revolves around Ezio taking over Rome. This time besides on a couple of occasions leaving the animus is entirely upto you. Ezio is after the power seat in Rome while building an army of followers and building an empire up. You will help civilians, assassinate corrupt officials, break into buildings, watch your main targets escape... alot, and good ol Leonardo makes a return thats a plus. its not as earth breaking as AC2. On a downside Ezio is cool but there is that lack of connection to Ezio if you haven't played AC2 in a while. Ezio starts out as the master assassin this time around so without watching him grow its kind of disconnecting. Personally story is the least of my concerns due to the love i have fore the gameplay.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not Assassin's Creed 3...", "unixReviewTime": 1290556800, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "A3RTFUIV7J67DI", "asin": "B003L8DXOI", "reviewerName": "Elton Lee", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I just wanna add to the already excellent reviews here for AC: Brotherhood. I have been an avid fan of the series since the inception and now on the 3rd game I am totally immersed in the AC world! Nothing could go wrong in this 3rd installment. My anticipation for this game shoots up the roof when it was announced. But then I was asking myself how could ubisoft create another one in the series in such a short period of time? 1 year to be exact between the release of AC2 and AC: B. So I thought to myself that perhaps they have a separate team working on this title while the other team worked on AC2. How thoughtful indeed to keep the masses to continue have an undying interest in AC.So what is the difference between B and AC2 you might ask? The story continues where AC2 left off. The minute the game commenced, you are in the exact same spot where AC2 ends and then the story developed incredibly and expanded in all directions. I have loved AC2 and then B gave me a whole new world and possibilities to toyed around and dived into the life of the protagonist and his journey. I really thought at the time AC2 came out it was an awesome game considering that ubisoft have added so much to AC2 and created a new hero Ezio. I thought to myself what could ubisoft possibly top themselves with this new one? I was amazed and disbelief with all the new addition to the gameplay, story, character development, side quest, the awesome soundtrack and the entire package as a whole. This is something to be thrilled and enthused about.The minute the game starts, you are put in situation where new development take place. The action and the adventure placing you in a world of imagination, bewilderment and awe in the AC universe. I felt myself pulled in to engage in an ancient battle between the good and evil in a world unlike anything I have seen before. I really love playing as Ezio since his introduction in AC2. Now I can continue to play as him and find out more about his journey and adventure. His family, mother, sister, uncle Mario and the rest of his alliances are such an exhilarating experience to discover and and to be part of. And the new addition to the gameplay especially being able to be on the offensive side if you choose to is a great new feature found in B. Ezio is now able to do so much more compared to AC2.The side quests are just enormously exciting and invigorating to take on. And Rome is such a magnificent and vast world to wonder and to explore. The people, the structure, the environment, the location, the time period and the overall representation of Rome is incredibly inviting. I find myself immersed in Rome, wondering about and completing side quests, collecting treasures, flags, feathers, assassinating borgia captains to liberate its town, people from their tyranny. Building the town up from scratch in its different province after liberation is also very additive as the more I build the more money I have in the bank allowing me to upgrade my weapons and armor and to help progress the story and experience the AC world like never before.Another point I want to add is the Romulus quests of treasures in the underworld of Rome. The diversity and the platforming is just unbelievable! The discovery and the exploration is vastly expanded. Compared to AC2, B toppled it easily and in every way. Love the climbing, jumping, shimmering and swinging from one location to the next to discover a world beyond words. It is at times so spooky and intriguing and the other so inspiring to uncover whatever is hidden. There are 6 Romulus treasures to be explored and each is vastly different from the other, giving you a diversified experience and amazement that ubisoft has thought this out incredibly well and the execution of these 6 treasures design is commendable.The thought of building your own clan or brotherhood is greatly added to the mix. I found myself wanting to recruit more assassins to my cause, send them to missions all over europe to better themselves and to allow them to gain experiences as an assassin so that their ranks and levels would increased overtime and enabling them to be a valuable comrade when I need them or when circumstances calls for their aid. This is indeed a new awesome addition to the game and the world of AC at my disposal. I could have never been able to progress without the assistance of my fellow assassins. So it is truly a wonderful experience to have backups and to know that I have other assassins at my side supporting the creed and purpose of our existenceLastly the soundtrack just compliments the game in every way. The universe of AC is greatly enhanced with the emotions and feelings for Ezio and his quests. I find myself experiencing B like never before. The composition, the choir, the orchestration, the soothing female voices and the dark male voices, the suspense and the thrill it creates when in conflict or when engaged in missions, battles or your quests to right the wrong really brought the game to a whole new level. The experience is indeed extremely elevating. As I am writing my reviews, I am on my third play through. I find myself craving for more and wanting to experience Ezio's liberation for Rome and to build my brotherhood and to see the creed of the assassins take center stage. This is indeed a world I have truly come to loved and adored at great length. Will you take the plunge into the world of Assassins? I'm sure and confident that AC3 will toppled AC:B in its own way. Only the extremely talented team at ubisoft can execute such endeavor.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Blistering Experience!", "unixReviewTime": 1294704000, "reviewTime": "01 11, 2011"}

I was bored quickly.  There are way too many cinematics.  I would skip one only to go straight into another one and then a third with no gameplay in between.  I have an imagination and the whole point of playing video games is to control the character and create your own story.  I dont know why video games spend so much time on story.  If i wanted to watch a movie, i would go see a movie.  You know the story is going to suck because if the writers had any talent they would be making movies, not video games.  And if a game has a long drawn out story, it is most likely to cover up subpar gameplay.  But on to the multiplayer.I cant stop playing it.  The matchmaking is slow, but once you make it to the game it is a blast.  The game types offer good variety, but i would like to see more.  There is no reason why you couldnt do capture the flag or protection modes.  Mostly, you will be tasked with killing one player while another is trying to kill you.  There will be several npcs that look just like your target and they act like a real player though they dont really run.  That means running is a dead give away, but sometimes you will have to.  You get the most points for patiently walking up to your target and slicing their neck, but you know that at any moment your own neck might be sliced.  This results in many moments of panic when you make a break for it.  You either get a lesser kill or a rooftop chase takes place.The powerups you get for leveling up are also great.  Disguises, smokebombs, flashbangs, a one shot gun, speed boost, or the ability to morph some of the crowd to look like you.  The ways to kill are endless.  Do you walk, hide in some hay, or take to the rooftops?  This multiplayer is not for everyone and I was hesitant because some reviewers obviously do not like it.

I just got this last week because I have so many other games to play and I had not finished AC2. I have been playing this several hours per day and can see some amazingly good additions to the game. I will be speaking to the improvements I see as there are already some fine reviews giving a whole overview. If you have not played AC1 and AC2 then this might not be as helpful to you. If so, read on.Combat: OverviewRight off the combat system is greatly improved. In the past the taunt was about useless. Now it really does bother the foe enough to get a grab at their weapon or throw them off guard. The kick is easy to pull off and it gets them to drop their guard a bit. How many times have you fought an enemy in AC2 and would just pound and pound on their sword and hope one hit would get passed their defenses. In AC:B there are countless ways to get passed that wall and get a good shot in.Combat: StreaksI love the new streaks. As long as you can be quick enough you sometimes pull off multiple kills effortlessly. There is even achievements for kill streaks in the virtual training room.Horses:Now you can ride and fight from a horse. They also allow horses into the city. That always bugged me in AC1&2 the fact you had to dismount at the gate.Jumping and Climbing:It seems the climbing has been improved. It is still sometimes more difficult to climb areas that really are climbable but you didn't line up right. Jumping from ledge to ledge has been tweaked. It is now easier to make serial jumps.Outfits:I like the new armor. I wont go into a full spoiler but basically you start out with nothing again in the beginning.Online:Very fun to play online against other players. I am not very good 1v1 on these games so I did not enjoy it as much as others would, not the games fault, I just got roflstomped too often.Overall:This game is a perfect addition to the series.

This and Assassin's Creed II are amazing games!  I have very much enjoyed the awesome gameplay and open worldness of these 2 games.  There is so much to explore, especially as more area opens up as you go along...and there is plenty of little side quests and items to find throughout the environment to keep you plenty busy as you play along.  Plus, like II, after you have beaten the story, you can continue to play to try and find everything you missed and play all the side quests you didn't get around to.  I like the addition of recruiting fighters to build them up as assassins to join the guild.  There is an even greater variety of weapons you can use throughout this game, and a new assortment of fun little gadgets and other stuff to make hunting enemies and exploring more enjoyable.  There are so many great weapons to chose from for melee fighting, but I think my favorite was this one particular mace that you can by later on...I call it Ezio's bashing stick.  There was some pretty brutal counter kills that could be done with that weapon...loved it!  Haha!  I enjoyed the storyline...continuing on with the story of Ezio, and at times I was very immersed in it.  Just ask my wife, haha.My only little gripe about this game was that, like II, it had a tendancy to glitch out just a little bit every now & then.  As an example, sometimes when I would be running along a rooftop chasing someone and trying to catch them, Ezio would occasionally jump a completely different way than I was running or he would not grab ahold of a ledge when prompted.  There are other examples of this, but that is just an example.  However, these little glitches weren't consistent, and I could in no way bring myself to mark this game down any for that because overall it's just simply an amazing game!  I highly recommend this series to any gamer out there who loves a good open world action adventure game like I do...it's simply awesome.

He is getting a lot more playtime and the first section you play with him as is nostalgically similar to the Assassin's Tombs in AC2 (only a lot easier and more latches and lifts.)The Shrines of Romulus will be the new \"assassin tombs\" giving a armor that will give you full synchro with Ezio.On Ezio's side  you will see the return of \"flags\" that were in AC1 and the \"feathers\" in AC2, and getting all of them unlocks their own rewards.In conclusion, as to not give any spoilers, the story is what you would expect from this franchise.... awesome. Graphics looks a lot better than what I remember (having played the ps3 version of AC@.)Gameplay:Combat-Assassin's Creed is definitely evolving and I am liking it's progress. AC1 was basically spam the attack button and block... cool at first, right?AC2 expanded on this with counter kill moves, but then we would be stuck waiting for the A.I to attack us for easy kills.Brotherhood ADDS all of that and combines it with a stronger and smarter A.I,  making the enemies attack you back to back (instead of in turns), and offensive gameplay is  now a lot stronger than it was before. So the battles are quick and gory with even larger battles going on compared to previous ACs.Additions to previous features->New Weapons>New Armors (sadly the \"armor\" gotten for pre-ordering at Amazon is an outfit)>Trade Items furthering the element of a role playing game>Run your own city (in this case Rome) is back on a larger scale> and of course, the ability to make your Brotherhood of assassins (it's the name of the game!)Multiplayer-Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the first game in series with a multiplayer mode!! We asked for it, and they answered.The animi you see at the beginning of AC2 is the back story of the multiplayer section of the game. Abstergo templars use the animi to gain the skills of assassins with the bleeding effect, and that is us.Each player is assigned a target (some other player), now the player has to assassinate its target without losing their cover, or they will be killed by the person who was assigned to assassinate THEM!I haven't gotten into the story mode that much yet, but apparently the multiplayer characters we will play as are in the main story, so everything is tied in nicely, right?!Uplay points- Assassin's Creed 2 was the first to have these and of course, every new Ubisoft game has them. Brotherhood is no exception to this. If you do not know what this entails, it is basically ubisoft's version of trophies or achievements. They unlock exclusive themes and ingame media (extra bullets skins, multiplayer character, etc). Pretty nice of them.If you have already beaten AC2 as I have you get 20 uplay points at the start of the game.In Closing:As a fan of Assassin's Creed, I can't help but just praise it with a perfect score. If you have seen trailers, demos, gameplay videos... just take a dive and give it a try, it at least deserves a trial run.

I became a fan of the Assassin's Creed series after playing Assassin's Creed 2 which upped the ante on so many levels within the gaming experience from the first title and further tweaked it with Brotherhood. The series captivates with the awesome story line moving from Altair to Ezio Auditore...and the series grew they (Ubisoft) branched out into other assassins expanding the story line...through Desmond Miles who had a link to the assassin's and their lineage through the various historic periods in time.Brotherhood refined a lot of the game play as a single assassin earlier on in the game and as the missions unfold you are introduced to other characters in the game that lend support throughout. It's like having a team player co-op within a single player environment and each of the characters bring their own style of moves and assassination.Apart from Assassin's Creed 2 & Brotherhood I was recently gifted Assassin's Creed 3 (collection growing) which I haven't played as yet since I like to go through the story lines and game play before moving on to the next title and hopefully I complete these  it in time for the new title &#34;Black Flag&#34;.

It had great graphics and sound and a terrific variety of gameplay. While 'Assassin's Creed Brotherhood' may not be a true sequel to the franchise it's a bigger and more polished upgrade to 'Assassin's Creed 2' with even MORE gameplay thrown in!'Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood' picks up right where AC2 left off: Ezio has defeated the pope and got a trippy apocolyptic message and must fight his way out of Rome and into another revenge/conspiracy story involving the Borgia family. Meanwhile Desmond and the gang are also on the run and must explore Ezio's old hideout (now in a modern setting) for the artifact everyone is after. While the story itself is more straight forward than AC2's, it manages to perfectly balance the gameplay between Ezio and Desmond's story. I actually enjoyed exploring modern Italy as Desmond and am now getting more comfortable with his crew as characters. All the voice actors return and give the same knock-out performances as last time, especially Roger Craig Smith who's aging Ezio nicely.The basic gameplay in 'Assasin's Creed Brotherhood' is pretty much the same as AC 2's but is a lot more polished and refined. You can now take the offensive in combat and string together moves and instant kills (much like Batman Arkham Asylum's free-flow combat). Also you can now purchase property in Rome and take control of different 'Guilds' (Thieves, Mercenary's, brothels) and actually explore inside these structures and take part in side-quests and mini-missions. Even shops this time around have side-quests you can complete to get special weapons and armor!Along with the basic gameplay being amped up you can now recruit different people in Rome as assassin's, train them and customize and level them up. It's not a HUGE addition to the game but a fun one that gives you a sense of power over a group of people.One thing I want to make clear again: While 'Assassin's Creed Brotherhood' is a full game (took me around 20 hours doing some side quests) it's very much a EXPANSION of 'Assassin's Creed 2', NOT a sequel. If you didn't like 'Assassin's Creed 2' or did but are looking for the next step-up in gameplay, you should definitly save your money and wait for Assassin's Creed 3.I love 'Assassin's Creed 2' so I love 'Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'.

Its not like ur regular multiplayer (which is just usually FPshooter or racing, or fighting) this is something that requires alot of planning and consistency5) Ive been playing for hours on end, if u are a completist like me, get this game, a lot of this to find and doDifference from AC2 and ACBrotherhood?I gave AC2 a 3.5 because I remembered that the gameplay seemed so repetitive in the end of the story, however in this ACB, the gameplay is just as great as AC2.

I kept playing even after beating the main quest to unlock more things, that's how you know you have a quality game.So, in order of quality of this series, it ranks like this:(1) Brotherhood(2) AC II(3) Revelations(4) ACI am just hoping that AC 3 lives up to this standard and makes a fitting conclusion to the series.

When news began to trickle in that it would include multiplayer I was a little disheartened. I anticipated that the developers would focus solely on the multiplayer and do single player as an afterthought; thankfully I was very wrong.New Features:Everything that made Assassin's Creed 2 great is back and better than ever. leaving aside the new weapons like the crossbow, the new Assassins feature is amazing. you can recruit the oppressed people of Rome to join your cause and through sending them out to do tasks they gain experience and level up. Those recruits that aren't on missions abroad can come to your aid wether you're being overwhelmed by the enemy, have a target that's just out of reach or if you want to just see Ezio kill a group of guards just by raising his arm. One would think that gets boring after a while but it just adds another level of awesomeness that you really have to try.Story:The story continues where Assassin's Creed 2 left off. For a game that's supposed to be Assassin's Creed 2.5 there are a lot of developments that definitely move the story along in a whole new direction. It's hard to really get into it without giving much away but be prepared for a lot of \"Oh wow!\" moments.Pro:- Fresh story fits well with what the franchise has given us so far.- Fighting has been refined and you'll find yourself picking fights with guards just for fun very often.- I can't emphasis enough how great the new assassin recruits are.Con:- If there is one gripe it's that there is the occasional glitch here and there. nothing game breaking though.Verdict:If you're on the fence about this one, get off it.

The amazing details to the architecture, the realism, the fight sequences, the ability to sneak and be stealthy... I really appreciated how the team of historians paid painstaking detail to the construction of Rome.  I enjoyed climbing up and down the Coliseum, the Pantheon, seeing the aqueducts... I enjoyed `restoring' Rome.The game in it's complete entirety was amazing.  Yes, there is always repetition.  They have to find ways to place the `synchronization' towers around the city so that you can `uncover' new locations - these are a staple of the game.  I was actually amused at the different ways they incorporated their syncrho places in the architecture.The game itself has taken on a little bit of a GTA tone.  This game is not as long as the others - if you played it straight through and did very few side missions.  However if you actually allowed yourself to become immersed in the game it could easily take you a good month or two of playing time - just running and jumping and collecting all the fun stuff that there is to collect.The game is brilliant.  The controls stay very similar to the original so that the gamer does not have to slow down and learn a new battle system.  Of course they up grade the weapons and give you some really awesome weapons to use.  I was pleasantly surprised to find some long distance weapons so that I could reach out and touch some one a little easier.My only qualm with the game was that the crowd was not as responsive as it was in games past.  The crowd was almost passive.  In games previous they would interact and they would report your misdeeds, forcing you to blend or be killed by the guards.  I wish the game was a little harder.  A little more complex. Sort of like it was in the first AC.  AC1 was difficult and you really had to `hide' in the crowd.  It took a lot of patience and skill to sneak up on your targets.  In both AC2 and ACB there was never that much of a challenge.  In AC2 there was more of a need to be silent and use stealth.  The crowd was much more aware of your actions.  But ACB looses this some where.As for the multiplayer... it is fun.  I actually enjoy the need to be sneaky and hide.  I like the idea of being trying to show who the better assassin is.  I think that it was a difficult premises to begin with and that the creators of ACB did a alright job with delivering the concept.  I wish that there was a way to fight your adversary and perhaps there is the higher up you get.  But what I saw initially is running around in a small sand box, looking for your target while others look for you.  It would be nice if you could defend yourself.In totality I think that the game delivers a degree of satisfaction that is not seen in the other two.  I truly enjoyed ACB.  I found it to be whole heartedly delightful.I stand by my rating of 10 out of 10 because ACB did what no other game has done this year - I was proud to have bought this game... and even more ecstatic that I was able to `see and explore' Rome...~TMM007 aka: Joshua.(SPOILER ALERT)PS...

You really have to outsmart both your target and your pursuer, simulataneously.  The perks and abilities you gain as you level up really add to the mix.

I was wrong, they certainly put some time into making a full single player experience. From what I understand it's slightly shorter than Assassin's Creed II's campaign. I played the multiplayer beta for the past month, and I was so happy when they made matchmaking faster, and added more game modes. The multiplayer requires stealth, attention to detail, and patience. It gets intense, but the people who run around all the time get annoying. It's like the complete opposite of COD. I like some of the changes they did to the single player. For one thing, you can combine weapons in combat, like you use the sword and gun together during combat. They cut out a lot of the stuff where you have to find codex pages to get your equipment, and instead you start out with everything. The animations are slicker, and there's more moves, as well as more finishing moves. Also, the A.I. has improved significantly; I actually have to run away from the guards once I'm surrounded by 5 or more of them, they're more difficult, and won't stand still while you're doing a finishing move or counter-attack on one of their teammates so you'll have to be a bit more careful.

I wanted to try a game that was more realistic, hence the purchase of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. It was quite a change of pace not having to slay monsters and riding a horse through the streets of Rome. I really enjoyed the combat in this game, (wish it was more of it) there's nothing like splitting a guard's skull with the bearded axe lol. I have to admit, It took me awhile to get used to having to physically find a Blacksmith shop to purchase upgrades (I'm accustomed to just pressing the start button and getting them). But once I upgraded, I really loved using those weapons! I enjoyed the scenery of Rome, tons of stuff to do and get into, maybe too much at times....There are a few reasons as to why I deducted a couple of stars. Now, this could be due to the fact that I have not played the first two installments, but this game was a bit overwhelming at times. I would be in the middle of a fight, and all of the sudden, a red icon is streaking across my map, I'm like who the heck is this??? I later found out it was a thief, how was I to know that? Or, I could be riding my horse trying to escape guards and all of the sudden a message pops on the screen saying that a deposit failed in the bank. And? Why would I care, I'm trying to escape. It was just a ton of little things like that going on throughout the entire game, just not used to that in an action game. Without all the mindless platforming, (especially as Desmond), this game would have been 8 hours long. It seems that they threw silly things in just to make the game seem \"longer\". I'm not a fan of the kind of puzzles AC used. The puzzles consisted of: here is a building, now figure out how to climb to the top. That would have been ok if the control scheme was better laid out. I can't count how many times I tried to climb, but ended up doing a wall jump in the other direction....I really wish there was more fighting in this game as opposed to all of the platforming and roaming around Rome (no pun intended). The Desmond stuff alone caused to me to deduct another star. I would have given this game 4 stars if I did not have to endure the Desmond nonsense at the end. All of the endless climbing and jumping really got on my nerves, not needed. I often asked myself, what the heck and I suppose to do now? Where the heck am I suppose to go, no map telling me anything while playing as Desmond. The only thing I'll say about the ending is that Desmond is such a tool...I would have had a blast with this game if there was more fighting and less platforming. For me, it's never good if I'm ready for a game to be over. I don't know if I'll get the next installment of this game, I'll just have to wait and see.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fun, but a bit overwhelming at times.", "unixReviewTime": 1308873600, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2011"}

Half the time I didn't know what the objectives were for full sync.  What really got me though, was there was no easy way to restart at a checkpoint to do the mission over if you failed a full sync.  Instead you have to start the ENTIRE mission over...which some missions can last an hour.  That system was frustrating and not an improvement.Where they REALLY made things better was the combat.  No longer is it just a game of counters.  Now you have to kick, shove, and counter.

AC:B boasts the best skies i've ever seen in a game. they're virtually photo-realistic.  compare AC:B skies with COD:BO skies.  no contest.2 - the open world gives you tremendous feeling of discovery and excitment.  the missions are nicely varied [the races from AC:2 are gone, thankfully]; the quests largely entertaining and some are very challenging; the characters memorable and likeable.  the platforming exceeds AC:B in almost every respect. destroying leonardo's four war machines was thrilling, and in my opinion, the most engaging part of the game.  the in-game economy, renovations, treasures, borgia flags, feathers, christina memories will provide hours of entertainment, for sure. the 'romulus' missions are great, too.3 - AC:B introduced a few new things - i almost jumped out my chair the first time i called in one of my assassin recruits who performed an air assassination. i felt sad the one and only time one of them died in battle. horses can now be ridden through cities and you even get to parachute from the top of a castle.  the best new weapon, in my opinion, is the crossbow - as if Ezio weren't already a big enough bad-a$$, the crossbow makes it doubly so.4 - AC:B nicely sets up AC:3, although with more than a touch of sadness.  whether or not Ezio de Auditore will be part of future installments remains to be seen [one can only hope], but AC will live on.there were only a few minor quibbles - horses tend not to jump off two inch ledges, shaun and rebecca continue be as annoying as ever, and some of the music, which is by and large fantastic, feels a bit hokey and melodramatic in places [particularly when destroying borgia towers].  but those are just minor issues in an otherwise beautiful and amazing game.ubisoft recently hinted that we may see yearly installments of Assassin's Creed through the year 2020. if so, i'll buy each and every one.if you're on the fence, take the \"leap of faith\" and join the brotherhood.  you'll be glad you did.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "a stunning game", "unixReviewTime": 1291680000, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2010"}

{"reviewerID": "A7HDIBPWU66SR", "asin": "B003L8DXOI", "reviewerName": "new Tron", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood can be best thought of as Assassin's Creed 2.5.  It is a direct continuation of Assassin's Creed II (see my review).  Although this installment has made some substantial improvements over the previous game, it generally feels like an expansion of it, and as a result, just like its predecessor, it is a very good game with some substantial flaws.Let me get some of the negatives out of the way before I talk about how good this game is (and it is quite good).  I was disappointed that the economic system of the game hasn't been improved, that being, at about the half way point through the game, you already have more money than God.  And when you have all the money that you'll ever need so early in the game, it takes away that money-chasing element that is so fun in the first half of the game, such as looting bodies, finding treasure chests, pickpocketing, and questing for money.  Another thing is the combat system.  Yes, I know this game was touted for its improved combat system, and it IS better this time around, with a nice kill streak system that is reminiscent of the Batman Arkham games.  But still, the combat still feels a bit sluggish and stiff overall, and to me, feels several steps behind most current gen games in this aspect.  Lastly, is that the controls still aren't as accurate as they should be.  Considering all the amazing movement you can execute in these games, it's embarrassing that something such as hopping off of a ledge, or making an accurate jump in a particular direction, can be so troublesome.With that said, Brotherhood is an overall better game than Assassin's Creed II.  Lots of the \"fluff\" of the first game has been cut out, mainly in the side quests, which are fewer and more meaningful and substantial this time around.  A good example of this are the \"DaVinci's Machines\" missions, which send you to different locations around Italy to destroy the war machines invented by Leonardo DiVinci that are being exploited by the Borgia.  Missions to assassinate Templar agents open up new areas of the map.  Courtesan, thief, and assassination missions are fewer, as opposed to the way they were bombarded upon the player in AC II.  The game's setting also continues to be fantastic.  Although lacking the diversity of the Florence/Venice/Tuscan countryside of the first game, the setting of Rome is stunning in its detail, scope, and feel.  Once again, the teams at Ubisoft have proven themselves the masters at making vibrant, historical worlds that not only look and sound great, but also serve to teach the gamer a thing or two about history.  And although the story of Ezio in this game is entertaining, it's generally more of the same.  It's the story of the main protagonist of the series, Desmond Miles, that steals the show here, and propels the narrative of this series to a new high.I have to mention two features of the game that really stood out as my favorite, and really helped make this game a step up from Assassin's Creed II.  The first are the Romulus Lairs, which replace the Templar Lairs from AC II (which were also very enjoyable in their own right).  Unlike the Templar Lairs, which mainly just required precise platforming to complete, the Romulus Lairs are almost self-encompassing game worlds that Ezio has to penetrate in order to decode a mysterious scroll and retrieve the game's ultimate set of armor.  They are extremely diverse, containing elements of platforming, exploring, combat, and chase sequences that really stand apart from the main game.  At times, they give Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood the feel of a dungeon crawler with secrets around every corner and surprises at every turn.  These were stunningly well done, and always a highlight to play.  The other great feature of the game is the ability to build your secret army of assassins.  This is done through a mini game where you recruit citizens to become soldiers in your secret army, and then send them on missions around Europe where they gain experience points, which in turn lets you upgrade their armor and weapons.  Once they have leveled up enough, they become quite powerful and are able to undergo more difficult missions.  But the best part about having this army of assassins is that they are available to come to your aid in battle at almost any time.  You can have them silently take out guards that are out of your reach, or cause a rainstorm of arrows to instantly eliminate huge crowds of enemies.  Having a strong assassin army at your fingertips is just awesome, and best of all, can save you the trouble of having to get into combat scenarios more than you'd like.  It is a great addition to the game that feels very natural and is extremely fun.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues the tradition of this fine series in a very good way.  There is definitely still room for improvement here, and at the rate Ubisoft is releasing games in the series, the opportunity to phase out the flaws and fine tune the high points is there.  In the meantime, if you enjoyed Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood is definitely worth the purchase and is a superior game overall.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "An expansion to Assassin's Creed II", "unixReviewTime": 1329696000, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2012"}

This was a hard review to do because parts of this game are just as fantastic and sometimes more so than Assassin's Creed II(one of my favorite games of 2009.) Other parts are annoyingly frustrating, difficult and sometimes just plain stupid. Let's look at the positive first shall we?Graphics on this game are stunning. The only annoyance of Assassin's Creed II was the screen tearing that pretty much occurred whenever you moved the damn camera. I know that the XBox version did not suffer from this as much. That being said when Ubisoft said that they would try to make the PS3 version of ACB as close as the Xbox version as possible, I think they succeeded for the most part. Screen tearing still occurs but mainly in cutscenes(I have seen You Tube videos showing the XBox version and guess what? Screen tearing in the damn cutscenes!) Overall the game looks great. The only time I saw a framerate drop was near the end of the game.Gameplay picks up where AC2 left off--that being said, Awesome. Sword fighting is really fun and easy to be good at. A variety of weapons keeps things interesting as well. The Cross Bow and the Poison dart gun were really cool additions. Climbing and jumping all over Rome is just as fun as it was during AC2. I loved being able to upgrade and buy pretty much all of Rome. Burning the Borgia Towers was also a nice gameplay addition.My favorite parts of this game are where I was just wandering around, giving missions to my Assassins(another awesome addition to the AC game), doing side missions and finding treasure and collectibles. If this was the whole game, I would have loved it.Unfortunately, eventually you have to go back to the main storyline which is to say in a word, AWFUL!!. Near the end I had no clue what was happening or why!! Most of the main storyline missions are either timed(which I HATE), over if you are detected by ANYONE(WHich I loathe as there is no real stealth abilities in the game) or plain old ridiculously difficult(the Bomber mission comes to mind which I finally gave up on due to terrible control of the damn plane!!)Not sure how AC2 could be so fun and this one could be so bad(in terms of story missions) There was a point near the end where I almost gave up but I hung tough and did finish the game(you can check my Trophy list to verify) No game should be like that! Especially one which has so many positive features like this one. Oh well, being I paid $40 for this game and spent close to 40 hrs playing, I guess I shouldn't complain too much. It is worth a buy but just be prepared for some parts where you want to throw your $60 Dualshock against the wall!

If you have NOT played Assassin's Creed 2 (AC2), stop reading this and go play AC2 first!!!AC: Brotherhood (ACB) is in all intents and purposes AC2.8 in gameplay and story. The reason I call it AC2.8 instead of AC2.5 is that it is HUGE in terms of content and gameplay, much of which is carried over from AC2.PROS- Open-world gameplay still rocks! Do what you want, when you feel like it! Explore hidden ruins, continue with plot missions, win back control of the city, hunt for hidden treasures, renovate shops...the choice is yours!- The weapons are very similar for the most part with a few minor additions, and the gameplay elements have changed slightly. This is a GOOD thing is you enjoyed AC2 as I did.- The battle system has been improved slightly but creates a significant upgrade to the experience overall. Enemies no longer take turns to attack you one at a time. They try to \"sucker-attack\" you from behind when you are engaged with another enemy, which makes things a lot more challenging and requires you to make strategic moves. Cool!- Load times are still quite good, Considering the size of the world/map, this is a solid accomplishment.- Your own 'gang' of assassins - the biggest change from AC2 is the addition of the ability ot recruit assassins and send them on missions. You can earn money and XP by successfully completing missions, and upgrade each assassin in terms of a few attributes such as armor, weaponry, and outfit color. This is a nice addition that adds depth to the game. You can send one (or many) assassins to each mission, and decide how much risk to assume; example: as you assign assassins to a mission, you are given a probability of success (up to 100%) so you can send as many or as few people as you wish. The trade-off is not having them available for story missions or side quests. I kind of wished you can get updates for these missions as some of them require up to 15 minutes to complete, and they progress in the background so it's possible for you to lose track of what's going on.CONS- As for the negatives, which are minor, the voice acting for Desmond's cast/group is pretty weak, but passable as long as you don't pay too much attention to it.- There are some minor annoyances such as the visuals not being quite as sharp as you might like it to be, but you can easily overlook this flaw in exchange for smooth, stutter-free frame rate (let's just say it's NOT Fallout: New Vegas by any stretch of the imagination!).- Other weak points are armor upgrades. Instead of being able to purchase upgrades when you have enough money (as in AC2), this game requires you to complete certain \"challenges\" that consist of gathering various items before you are allowed to make the purchase. This seems to be an artifical way of lengthening the game and making it more challenging, but not a big deal I guess. Since money is relatively easy to earn, I can see how the developer does not want you to amass a huge fortune and upgrade your character to the max in a short time, hence eliminating the difficulty of the game.Just a few notes on multiplayer - I have tried MP a few times but have had trouble getting into matches. They seem to take a long time to process. The few games I have gotten into were fun but nothing to jump up and down about. I see it as a nice 'extra' but probably won't keep your attention very long.In conclusion, this is one of the best games I've played in a very long time. Any fan of AC series should definitely get this, and any fan of open-world adventure games should seriously consider this title!!!EDIT: 12/30/2010Just finished the game; the ending was a bit of a surprise.

It is the same stealth / action gameplay as always, and it's just as fun here as it was in the previous installment. Some minor additions include horse-riding anywhere, improved combat, destroying Borgia towers in order to be able to renovate and develop areas of the city, and a few new mission types. The main new addition is the guild of assassins that you can recruit and manage by sending them off on their own missions or by calling them to your immediate aid. The assassins level up and become stronger as you give them assignments, and you will have a great time remaining stealthy while you summon your elite group of killers to do your dirty work.The real surprise for me with this game was the addition of the multiplayer modes. this is coming from a player who rarely spends any significant time with online multiplayer, and wow, this is the most interesting, addicting, and fun multi i have ever played. There are a selection of different character skins players choose from, then they enter a location that is populated by dozens of clones of all the skins. Each player is assigned a target to kill and has another player targeting them. The goal is of course to kill your target while evading your pursuer. Simply killing is not always the best method though, as major points are awarded for the quality and stealth of your kills, not simply the quantity. You will need to identify which of the identical looking skins is the human player that you need to kill, which is difficult enough, but add in some useful abilities and perks, and the trickery and deception really go through the roof. This definitely feels more like a mind game than a contest of who has the fastest trigger finger.As with other modern multiplayer systems, AC brotherhood's features a leveling system with new abilities unlocking as you progress by gaining exp and completing challenges. In addition to the standard mode i described above (Wanted) there is a 2v2v2 team mode called alliance (works the same way but with 3 teams of two) and a 4v4 mode called manhunt. Manhunt is different in that the teams take turns being the killers and the escapers. The 4 player teams make for some interesting strategies that don't apply to the other modes. All in all, I have found all three modes to be very fun.To sum up, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is definitely not AC3, but it's not a mere expansion. It is an incredibly robust game with a lot of variety to offer, but also a lot of familiarity. The music is appropriate, the voice acting is decent / good, the graphics are about the best you can hope for in an open world, the controls feel pretty solid most of the time, and the length and depth of content will keep you busy for at least 15 hours through the main game. Two minor gripes are both technical issues, one being that in multiplayer sometimes game-matching seems to hang and you just have to exit and restart, which is frustrating. The other issue has plagued the series before and that is weird glitchiness. It's not as bad here as in previous installments, but i did end up stuck inside a tree and had to reset the system within the first hour of playing...anyway, these small issues do not compromise the game enough to knock even 1 star off this 5 star rating. This is the best Creed yet and should not be missed for its great quantity and quality of gameplay.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quantity AND Quality - - Great single player, Amazing multiplayer", "unixReviewTime": 1292284800, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2010"}

I have part 1, 2, and now brotherhood in my collection and this is my opinion of the game and game play.Pros regarding single player mode:-plays like assassins creed 2-new armor-new moves-you get more money from the guards when u loot them (makes it much easier to accumulate money)-leaves off from assassins creed 2-you get to train your own Assassins!!!!! (To me that is the BEST Part in Assassins Creed brotherhood)-also you get a parachute so u don't have to worry about killing yourself now when u accidentally jump from high places (but it doesn't come until later in the game)now.......Cons regarding single player mode:-you get your own assassins to train but u don't really get to customize there gear, or really what they wear.-the story is really short, makes this an expansion pack at best, beat the game within 20 hrs of play-after playing the main story there really isn't much to do after that. I pretty much have all my trophies in single player except for subject 16 and the Borgia flags.-You only get to stay in Rome which makes it really boring!!!! In other assassins creed games you get to go to different places which made the game play considerably long but in this one not soo.. I believe they did this because of the multiplayer aspect in the game which i could have personally did without.-Also you can play as Desmond more but come on.. who really wants to do that???-Now they have shop request in order to unlock things which to me is kinda dumb because I've accumulated so much money and nothing to really spend it on but thieves, mercenaries, and whores...-Oh yeah, subject 16 puzzles are too hard!!! wtf were they thinking when they made them?? It makes doing the puzzles a pain instead of something fun to do. which makes acquiring trophies hard which is pissing me off.... (I'm all for challenges but nothing too challenging.)now......Multiplayer Pros:-First online assassins creed game-different people to choose from-customizable characters even if its just a little bit-you get to disguise yourselfMultiplayer Cons:-servers are always too busy or messed up in someway-takes forever to get into a game-you cant really choose which game you want to be put in. they have 3 different game choices i believe and i cant play wanted, sometimes they throw me in team mode which i don't wanna play-Too glitchy, i can kill someone yet they ended up getting away, one minute my pursuer is away than right behind me stabbing me outta nowhere. characters move to fast or freeze outta nowhere.-Game-play gets too confusing. If i have my target surrounded by other targets like them its too hard to tell the difference. it gets really confusing. my sensor thing gets really confusing as well-Everyone looks like assassins its no fun when everyone looks the same and there isn't any real regular people in it. (I know its meant to confuse but that makes it too confusing)-You cant level up easily since its hard to get into a game therefore making it hard to get trophies!!Personally my main gripe is why did they put trophies for multiplayer?? Seriously reach 50?? Every time i get on, the network is having a problem or its too glitchy, also online is very repetitive so it gets really boring really fast. I know its not call of duty but come on......At any point, in my humble opinion, i would wait until the price drops to at least $30. Although it has some big improvements from Assassins Creed II its not as extensive and it can get really boring really fast. So at best it really is more like an expansion pack with some improvements.

It's a very similar game, only everything has been upgraded, refined and improved.  These improvements are just some new bells and whistles and a shinier coat of paint -- it's a deeper game that incorporates more strategy along with the awesome new ways to kill people.The story in a nutshell: The stakes increase even more as the Borgia family drops the hammer on the Assassins for all the hell Ezio raised in AC2.It's the same world, only localized to a fully realized, enormous Rome.  Hence, you're not having to schlep it from city to city on a horse, which is nice.  Limiting the story to Rome (for the most part) also gives the game more focus.The gameplay is more or less the same, only enhanced with more diverse objectives, more fighting moves, more weapons.  You also begin to build a guild of assassins whom you train, equip and build. Having a team of assassins to do your bidding is not only amusing, but becomes a necessary part of your strategy to complete some missions.ACB is also more focused on the story at hand.  In AC2, there are all sort of side-missions that while mostly fun, have nothing to do with the superobjective of the story.  While I was playing AC2, I'd think, \"Why am I collecting these feathers?\"  or \"Why am I going to beat up a cheating husband while in the meantime I'm supposed to be rescuing my family on the eve of their scheduled execution?\"  Obviously video games have lots of conceits, but Brotherhood keeps these to a minimum, so that Ezio's efforts are more or less contributing to defeating the Borgias.An aside: If you haven't played Assassin's Creed 2, I'd recommend starting there.  It begins the story of Ezio, and Brotherhood is a continuation of that story.The bottom line is that this game is FUN.  Nay, SUPER FUN.

This is by far the best game in the Assassin's Creed series so far. Ubisoft has learned from the mistakes it's made in previous AC games, and made a sequel that outshines its predecessors by far.For those who have played the first two games, the storyline is familiar already. If not (spoilers!), it's simple and, well, sort of ridiculous. Age-old warring factions -- the insidious, villainous Templars, who ally with the Church and those \"in power\" vs. the persistent, valiant Assassins, who ally with the thieves, cutthroats, prostitutes, and \"underdogs\" of society -- continue to fight. You play as two people: Desmond, the modern* day Assassin who lives his ancestor's memories through a machine created by a modern day corporate arm of the Templar; and (in this and ACII) Ezio, one of Desmond's Assassin ancestors from medieval Italy. *At least, we assume Desmond is the present day character, although, theoretically, he could be an ancestor whose memories someone else is living, to see the memories of the ancestors that he is seeing...but that's probably way over thinking things :PAnyhow, continuing with this theme, in Brotherhood (again, spoilers), the Church is evil and villainous because they're a bunch of scheming, power hungry, sexually immoral thieves and cutthroats. Your side is wonderful because you're marvelous scheming thieves, cutthroats, pimps and prostitutes (While churchmen are disgusting for hosting...unusual, shall we say?...parties complete w/near nudity and hookers, Ezio's sister/mother end up running the brothel in Rome, in order to collect information from the Templars who visit \"their girls\"; etc). While this storyline could well replace Viagra in Keith Olbermann's life, it's really pretty dumb.The voice acting can be less than stellar at times...the \"I'm atrying to sound Italiano, but I am astinking at it\" moments are certainly there. Again, this is no worse than previous games, however.That said, however, the game is still a blast (I know, it sounds like a contradiction; but hear me out). Ezio (despite his many flaws -- like the fact that his line of work often requires killing men who are just following the law [the guards]) is still the likable character he's always been; his sister Claudia (despite the fact that she works as a pimp...) is a likable character; etc. The voice acting, even in its most awkward moments, is no worse than the storyline; and, if one is willing to accept that silliness (as one has to be, to play), the voice acting seems hardly noteworthy.The best part of this game (singleplayer, anyway) -- what really distinguishes it from the other two -- is that Ubisoft seems to have perfected the balance of doing and planning -- and nixed most of the more annoying Prince of Persia-style stunts in the process. In the first game, the gameplay was a lot of fun -- but quickly got old, as you did the same thing again and again and again with no idea why, except that you were told to do so. In the second game, Ezio was much more a part of the planning process (not just running here and there with no idea why killing people), so the game was far more interesting; however, the designers had introduced just enough timed races/puzzles/traps and whatnot to make the game very annoying (to a non-PoP player like me, at any rate). This game perfected the balance; Ezio is still key to the deliberative process, so the player knows what's going on; the original game play of the first one was merged with the game play of the second (and a few new things, too) to make it just challenging enough without being irksome. A job very well done!I've finished the \"story mode\" (singe player), and have just started playing the multiplayer (I'm only a level 8 at this point)...but it is a blast too! The two multiplayer modes I've played (I'm not sure if there are more?) were a team based hunt -- one team is hunter, the other hunted; then this role reverses -- and a contract based hunt (where you hunted a single target [another player] and are yourself hunted by other player[s]). These are both a lot of fun -- the latter especially (imho). I was furthermore pleased to note that my somewhat lousy internet connection was not an impediment to play...I've experienced no lag time whatsoever so far as I play.All in all, as someone who has played the series through (and so knew in advance of the silly storyline/less than stellar voice acting, etc.), I give this 4/5 stars. If you liked the earlier games, you'll love this one. Don't go in expecting a \"fix\" to the storyline...it's not going to happen...but you can look forward to more of Ezio, and improved gameplay.

Ding", "helpful": [2, 8], "reviewText": "While AC1 was a game of originality and innovation, Ubisoft managed to screw up AC2 and turn it into an unenjoyable mess. (Very much like anything else Ubi's touched recently, like Rainbow Six: Vegas).Now, with Brotherhood, many of the things done wrong in AC2 have been improved upon. Not fixed, but merely polished up. So, to sum it up, AC:B is overrated garbage 2.0.___Story___Story telling is slightly better than in AC2, but not as good as AC1. AC2's story was pretty much non-existent, random, and doesn't make ANY sense, unless you read the in-game bio PLUS wikipedia entries, you are not gonna know or care who any of these bald, fat, old European dudes that you are trying to stab are. AC: B's story makes a bit more sense, but it's still pretty lacking. The AC story, so far, could've been Left 4 Dead's story, and no one would be able to tell the difference.The Desmond story is what facilitates all the DNA sequences, the PRESENT DAY story arc is what connects all the dots, and should be what motivates players to keep on playing. In both AC2 and AC: B, there is MINIMAL storytelling for the present. Basically, you get in the animus, and from then on it's \"go here, talk to informant, go there, assassinate\". The ancient story is drawn out, and 99% of it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the main storyline. It seems that Ubisoft could've easily condensed the contents of AC2, AC:B, AND AC: Revelations, into a single game. Instead, they make this unnecessarily elaborated Ezio arc that spans into 3 main titles. It is clear that Ubisoft really doesn't care about making great games, but rather just cashing in on franchises.___Controls___Control is still a mixed bag. On the one hand, Ezio still behaves like a retard sometimes, especially when platforming and when you are trying to act fast. On the other hand, using the hidden blade in large battles is much more fun and satisfying. In fact, I've been using hidden blade for 1 on 8 battles, all game long.Minor tweaks like when you would automatically get into target-lock mode makes gameplay more fluid, but also confusing at times.Really, AC series control scheme is just convoluted and doesn't work. It works somewhat for platforming. But they really should think of a way to simplify and streamline the controls.___Gameplay___People who complain that AC1 was repetitive say that AC2 and AC: B is much better. I'm like, \"lolwut\". You still have to collect viewpoints, save citizens from guards (who will later help you or join you), ride horses to places, and spam \"attack\" while holding down \"high profile\".Sure there are more mini games in AC:B that distracts you, like the \"economy\" and Assassin Guid, but it's still essentially the old AC1 formula.___After thought____Seriously, every time I play this, I think about how great the series could have been, and how Ubisoft is ruining it. It makes me sad and want to cry. The story is just there for them to release more AC games and make more money. There is about 10 minute worth of story in this entire game. The actions are repetitive and at times non responsive. Recycles characters, etc.However, like I said, it does have slight improvements over AC2, and just more mature than AC1. This makes AC:B the best AC game yet.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Overrated garbage 2.0", "unixReviewTime": 1323734400, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2011"}

I bought it the day it came out which I almost always regret, but this is one title that was worth the full 60$. As a strictly multiplayer gamer I never touched the Assassin's Creed games until I bought this, took it home and inserted the disc, and jumped straight into online competition. What I found was the \"Wanted\" game mode: an innovative mix of stealth and action gameplay, where the winner is determined by who murders the most players in the least conspicuous fashion. How it works is that you have one player who is your target, along with a rough compass directing you in the general direction of that player. The tricky part is that there are many computer controlled people walking about the town, stopping at shops, etc. who look exactly like your target. If your target is skilled he will act natural in order to blend in with the computer NPC's, making him very difficult to spot until he makes a move to kill his own target. Further complicating matters is the wide array of weapons, magic spells and tricks each player brings to the match, such as smoke bombs, throwing knives, muting and templar vision. As a way to balance all this madness, the developers made it so whoever is in 1st or 2nd place in any match has 2 or 3 people targeting them, while the noob in last place is not on anyone's hit list until he gets back in the game. All of these features culminate into the best gaming experience ever in my opinion and I've been playing since the 8-bit Nintendo, so seriously stop reading this, add it to your cart and checkout.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best video game I have ever played.", "unixReviewTime": 1314835200, "reviewTime": "09 1, 2011"}

There are a plethora of side quests you can accomplish while you finish the main story, and the pace at which the game gives you the best extras is perfect (extras as in weapons, guild challenges, assassins/contracts, etc). I can't say I was a huge fan of the vendor missions where you essentially collect a bunch of useless goods and by chance collect the right ones to unlock special items. Also, I expected more from buying landmarks, but they bring in less money then shops. Overall, there's a lot of gameplay to be had here. If you stuck strictly to the story you'd probably have &lt;10 hours of stuff to do, but with the extras that number easily triples. I've yet to try multiplayer, so I can't speak much there.

I guess they're just not my thing.  I popped this in the still-new PS3 and it took 20 minutes just to load--I thought it was broken.  Then the game started and it was like having to watch a movie for 20 more minutes before I could even do anything.  Then the movie scene paused and a prompt popped up telling me to hit one button while holding another, which I did.  Another ten-minute movie scene ensued, followed by \"Congratulations, you've won a trophy\" and \"Checkpoint Reached.\"  The controller was sitting on the coffee table.  I had pressed 2 buttons in 30 minutes of \"game play\" and somehow won a trophy and reached a checkpoint. I kept on for another hour or so, but just couldn't get into it. It went back in the box.

My stepson, who is a huge fan of these games, does say that further into the game there is less movie, more play.  He also says that he \"beat it in one night\" and \"it was okay,\" but now he's looking for a new game to play.  So my 1-star rating still stands.

S.\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Assassin's Creed Brotherhood picks up exactly where AC: II left off.  Ezio is back for another throat slicing, roof hopping, and horse riding adventure.  This time Ezio explores the ancient and holy city of Rome.  Don't worry about it being too small because it's only one city, it's huge!!  It's easily as big as three Venices from AC: II.  There are many new improvements and additions that give this game a different feel from its predecessor.  The boldest and most interesting addition is the online multiplayer.  AC: Brotherhood will be a game you won't forget.Remember those faces from AC: II?  Well they're back!  Uncle Mario, Leonardo and Claudia are just a few ready to stand behind Ezio.  There are also a few new ones, notably Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia.  Voices and movements are great and the graphics got even better.  I have heard about problems, like glitches but I downloaded an update before I started and I haven't noticed any major ones since.One of Ezio's jobs is to renovate Rome.  You buy landmarks, like the Coliseum, you buy stores, like blacksmith, tailor, and doctor, and you solve more of subject 16's puzzles.  Remember the tombs from AC: II?  Well now they have Lairs belonging to followers of Romulus.  The objective and the way you go about it remain the same.  If you complete all 6 lairs, you get Brutus's armor which is very strong like Altiair's'.  Inside you will do a bunch of free running and climbing, sometimes against the clock, or you might have to fight some Romulus followers.Flags, treasures and feathers are back!  You can purchase maps for them and they will pop up on your mini-map.  They not needed for the story, but if you want to get 100% sync and trophies you'll need them.  Speaking of synchronization, for all missions now there will be a certain objective for you to do.  If you don't do it you only get 50% sync on that mission.  Some of the things they will want you to do are: complete in under 8 minutes, use hidden blade to kill target, don't be detected, or some variation of those.  It can get frustrating at times, but you can always go into you DNA and replay any mission again later.The fighting has changed the most.  Remember in AC: II when you had to wait for your enemy to attack before you could perform a counter kill?  Well now you're rewarded for striking first instead of waiting.  You can perform what's called an execution streak, where you successfully kill a guard and then you can kill all the guards around you in one hit each if you can avoid taking damage.  It is a skill that takes some time to learn, but once you pull it off and kill 10 guards before you can blink, you will become addicted to it.  Travel has also changed; you can ride your horse through the city instead of just the country.  There are also tunnels that you can renovate and then zoom around the city to other tunnel stations for free.  Another new and notable feature is the assassin guild you now command.  What you do is find people who are being attacked by the Borgia and you save them, then they are added to your guild, then you send them on missions to gain experience and make you money or you can call on them in battle.  They will jump out and stab your target or shoot arrows.  Once they reach level 10, they become an assassin where they are sworn in and they become very deadly.  It's a helpful tool, since now you don't have to do all the work yourself.The multiplayer is an interesting addition.  You play as characters from the single player campaign (executioner, doctor, nobleman etc.).  Your job in the multiplayer is to find and kill your target while at the same time avoid being killed yourself.  Essentially you are the hunter and the hunted at the same time.  You get more points for stealthy kills and less for not-so-stealthy ones.  For example, if you killed your target from a hay cart or while blended in a crowd, you would get maybe 500-700 points.  But if you were spotted by your target before you killed him, and had to chase him down and stab him, then you would only get maybe 100 points.  See the difference?  Points are added up after each match and bring you up to the next level.  The higher the level you are the more equipment you have.  For example you can get smoke bombs, the ability to morph into someone else for 15 seconds or a super sprint power.The ending of AC: Brotherhood is very climatic, sort of like the AC: II ending.  I can almost guarantee that they will make another sequel, probably with the good men Ezio and Desmond again.  It will most likely be another extension like AC: Brotherhood was and not a new series.  I wonder what they will do for AC: III??

The the game play is very easy to grasp although I am almost done with teh game and still cant figure out how to chain kills.  The game is pretty fast paced, exciting and fun to play.  Also, the weapons are awesome and are extremely useful.  The one area where I find the game lacking is that certain aspects have made the game a bit on the easy side, but I will get into that.Story: 4/5-Truthfully, the story is ok.  I find the Desmond part of it so dumb and pointless.  Also the part in the beginning where you have to play as Desmond is aggrivatng as hell.  In essence Desmond's story is that he is an ancestor of Enzio and is being chased by the Templar, he has to defeat the templar by using a virtual realty system to overthorw the Borgia in Rome (that is wher eyou play as Enzio).  Enzio's story is really good especially when they start delving into the hidden missions regarding his past via the hidden Christina missions.Gameplay: 5/5-The gameplay is great, smooth and extremely elegant.  There are tons of missions, all of them related to the game and related to your life as an assassin (unlike Prototype where they are tedious side quests).  Most of the missions are not overly difficult and are pretty staight forward though many of them really require to strategize if you want to get a 100% completion for the mission.  Many of the side quests revolve around assassinating Borgia affiliates who are terrorizing the people of Rome.  Additionally, there are 15 Borgia towers where there is heavy enemy influence, you must kill the local captain who is a beefed up guard and burn down his tower in order to remove the influence.  If primary quests are in Borgia influence areas it is in your best interest to destroy the tower first or the missions will be a nightmare.The weapons are great especially the heavy swords.  My favorite weapon is the hidden blades, I find them the most effective.  There are swords, axes, maces, a cross-bow, a gun, poison and blades, all of which are exceptionally useful.  In my opinion the addition of the gun and cross-bow as well as their ease of use have made the game way too easy as I can just stand on a roof and snipe guards from a distance without being seen.Additionally, there is the inclusion of you being able to hire help from 3 distinct classes.  I find the mercenaries make the game too easy as you can take them with you into a mission and have them attack the guards while you do their thing, allowing you not to be detcted at all or allowing you to peform executions whaile the guards are busy fighting.  The inclusion of these mercenaries makes even the most difficult Borgia captain a breeze.Finally, through the game as you take down towers, you are able to rebuild Rome.  As you buy blacksmith's, art shops, banks, and doctors, you make money and you are bale to buy new items.  It is easy to spam this system, which as you buy banks, you make money at a super fast pace and can buy as many bullets or arrows as you want.Graphics/Visiuals: 5/5 - This is easy, the graphics and visuals are gorgeous.  You are running around 1500s Rome.  They producers made the city as close to historically correct as possible.  The game graphics are nearly flawless, smooth and there is minimal glitchyness.  Thank god, the load times are minimal, that drives me nuts!Multiplayer: 5/5-  The multiplayer is a real party.  I love it!  You go around killing other players either by stealth or brute force.  It is addictive.  Although it can get repetitive after a while, you really get addicted to it.Overall, this game is phenominal and a must buy.  Certain aspects make it slightly too easy, but that is rectified by the amount there is to do and the sheer insane number of missions.

It's a great game but it feels like a dlc add-on... a really, really big dlc add-on.The game's new and only location (Rome) is larger than any city in AC2, but not quite as beautiful or interesting. The cities in AC2 were varied and often romantic, especially when you arrived in Venice. Rome on the other hand is dilapidated and kinda bland.The fighting has improved with new move sets, new weapons (like crossbows and poison darts), and enemies who aren't afraid to attack you while you're engaged with another.Movement and control are less enjoyable for some reason. They're mostly the same as AC2 but a little less accurate, a little less responsive, and a lot more infuriating. This is mostly evident when a situation requires urgency. Ezio bumbles around like a moron, unsure of what you're trying to get him to do, while the enemy attacks him mercilessly.The new feature of recruiting and training assassins is a fun and welcomed addition, as are parachutes, horse ridding while in the city and upgrading shops and buildings for use.The story was relatively interesting, but didn't feel like a significant enough leap in the AC mythos. It feels like AC2 was a little too long and the overlapping segment was cut, stretched out and padded with content to justify a full disc. Regardless, I actually prefer this approach as opposed to repeated dlc releases.I have not yet played Revelations so I cannot say whether Brotherhood is a purchase necessary to understand the overall story. Most of what occurs will undoubtedly be recapped in Revelations but considering the current price ($20>), you may want to pick this up anyway.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A really big DLC", "unixReviewTime": 1335398400, "reviewTime": "04 26, 2012"}

What makes this game so great is its open world environment that comes with so many different challenges, an in depth story that focus on Ezio and Desmond, real historical characters combined with fictional ones, real combat sequences as well as supernatural ones towards the end of the game and being able to recruit your own assassins. Recruiting your own assassins makes Ezio more powerful because in many situations he doesn't even have to fight, his assassins will fight for him. Even the different challenges from using Leonardo's war machines adds an originality to the game.

The blood in this game isn't very glamorous but thats okay too.* ControlsBorderline ridiculous sometimes, especially with combat and free run/climbing. The free climbing/running is the best in any game I've played but it can get really frustrating with the controls.. you also aren't really sure if you're able to climb certain parts of a structure that looks like anyone with Ezio's climbing ability can climb but -- no, no it's not that easy.. it \"depends\" ~ but if you're not able to climb it the first time, you should give it another go as the controls does take time to get used to -- in fast paced situations you're more likely to fall down. Combat requires a lot of flow so it isn't a hack and slash game but having played GOW3 this feels very sluggish and choppy.* MultiplayerIntense. Be wary as this requires a lot of practice and skill to play, especially if you want to be #1. You are in this location seeking a target with a radar on your screen that goes full circle when your target is nearby and glows when your target is visible in your POV all the while your predator seeks you the same way. A video of this is available on this page (see Amazon's screenshots / videos) which sums up the multiplayer experience pretty well however I'd like to mention that to avoid getting assassinated you must FACE your opponent and press the circle button (PS3) when you see it pop up -- which doesn't always work, in this case you'd use a smoke bomb obtainable through leveling up in multiplayer.* Gameplay (Single Player)It's amusing. I dislike certain 100% Synchronization prerequisites not because they're challenging but they're borderline joy-killer. You end up focusing so much on completing the task with 100% synchronization by not being shot at the last checkpoint of 5 (in which each has its own condition for not being completely de synced) that it can get boring but beyond that the open-world feel of the game does make it perfect for those wanting to play the game at their own pace.Those are the things that stick out of my brain atm in regards to this game. I didn't want to repeat some of the things already said in the reviews on here so this is a bit more condensed than you'd expect from a full review.

{"reviewerID": "AP3V0ZR3XLVQX", "asin": "B003L8DXOI", "reviewerName": "Ton Yanzik", "helpful": [2, 7], "reviewText": "Regardless of how the game itself was, I must ask: was it needed? Did we really need an offshoot of the series before the main story was completed? This was my initial thought when I heard this game was coming out, and I still ask it having played it to the ending. Even if the game was good I would still question this, but unsurprisingly, it's far from it.The story in this series took a turn for the worst as this entry is entirely made up of excuses. Why did Desmond and his team go to Monteriggioni? So their cell phones couldn't be traced. But wouldn't the Templar's know this place well considering it was the former home base of a major assassin at one point anyway? And apparently the story is now taking place in Italy. No subtlety at all, and it destroys the 'In some place and time during our own era, this battle wages.' feeling the first gave it and the second continued. Why Ezio again? He hid a Piece of Eden and Desmond's team needs to find it. But did it really have to be Ezio? Couldn't another Assassin in another place and time have also hid a Piece of Eden? I wasn't a fan of Ezio in the last game and thought he was devoid of anything that makes a character interesting, but even without this dislike for him, Ubisoft has so much potential for new characters, yet they stay with Ezio. They could choose any place and time they want to but didn't. Ezio's story didn't leave off on a cliffhanger either. In fact, the ending of his story in Assassin's Creed II was one of the only things I enjoyed about it, but now that's ruined for an unneeded game about him. The plot itself is nonsensical. For some reason Ezio is convinced he needs to save Rome from a guy we're never really given a reason to hate. He's not shown to be a Templar or plotting specifically against the Assassin's, which is the plot of the series as a whole. Ezio's village is attacked, but this seems like filler and yet another excuse to continue his already ended story while making the main villain his direct enemy at the same time. There are a lot of jump cuts and cinematics to advance the plot which are poorly done, and almost no characters are interesting. There's also a betrayal plot which is so basic and secondary it doesn't even leave you guessing because there is nothing given to guess with. Like the first two games, the ending is surprisingly done well, but instead of the historical side shining, it lacks heavily and ends with two forced scenes of Ezio hiding the Piece of Eden. Desmond's story is the one to actually end nicely this time around despite blunt and strangely given dialogue.Gameplay is mostly the same as Assassin's Creed II. There's a decent amount of mission variety, but only a few are good. The city builder objective is back, but for no reason other than Ezio needing to rebuild Rome as he saves it. Why? To keep this aspect of the game from the second one, I would assume. As much as I loved it, it's not needed here and makes no sense, becoming another excuse. There are about as many side quests as the second game, but none fun or worth doing. View points and a new siege objective are here. The siege missions are about as fun as finding view points combined with the assassination missions from Assassin's Creed, but for some reason, all of them are constantly shown on the map despite the memory barrier blocking you from getting to them. This is a time waster and they should have only appeared as more of the map became accessible. This is something even Assassin's Creed got right. Combat is a mess this time. The blocking and countering has slightly improved and is more reminiscent of the fluid nature of the first game, but AI is terrible. They'll attack during predetermined actions, so you can't counter or block due to waiting for the strike or kill scene to finish. Somehow, guards can catch up to you, a supposedly skilled Assassin, while wearing full armor and strike you without fail, making getting away or catching up to someone an unneeded chore due to this false difficulty added. Crossbowmen can somehow shoot and hit with great accuracy the second they stand up from a fall or after climbing a building. Some missions are very glitchy, in that the game doesn't seem to know what to do. One specific example of this is when you have the Apple of Eden. The only action you have is to use the Apple, which manipulates guards. The objective is to kill specific guards by using others through manipulation. Several times during this mission the remaining guards were cowering on the ground and the objective stood still, making me wait several minutes before he finally died and the game realized it needed to move on. The camera is atrocious. Trees, buildings, and bushes will take up the entire screen at times, which is especially common is tight hallways/roads or anywhere with an overpass, and with the spinning nature of the camera back for a third time, this makes it even harder to get a good or even decent camera angle. But above all, the addition of mounted units makes combat a messy cluster of frustration. Mounted units need to be countered individually, and with a sword, so using the assassins blade is out. This is difficult because the same stiff locking mechanism is back from the second game and who you lock onto is entirely random. I can stare directly at a mounted unit and still end up locking on to a guy who's closer to me, but off to the side. Ubisoft clearly didn't learn from their mistakes in the second game, or follow a 'less is more' philosophy. Once again, they just hoped adding more stuff would improve their repetitive and slightly boring first game, but it had the opposite affect, by ruining what was actually good with the series to begin with.Platforming is the same as the previous two games. It's not even worth getting into how bad it is at this point, but it's actually semi-patched this time around. Certain problematic areas are now coated over like a magnet, pushing you away instead of letting Ezio do something you don't want him to. This is too little too late, however, and doesn't make up for the system itself. It needs far more than a few bandages. The free roam go anywhere do anything formula is unexpectedly gone with this entry. There are many steep cliffs and walls that prevent you from going certain ways, and instead of just climbing over your obstacles like in the first two games, you now need to go around them at some points. I often times wondered \"Can I make this? Would I be able to climb that? Is that really a ledge or just the graphics?\" Areas are much more restrictive because of this, and along with inconvenient memory walls, the mobility of Ezio is diminished to the point where I didn't even want to climb things, instead using the ground most times to get around. This is not something that should happen in a free roam game that boasts its flexibility for the player to go anywhere and do anything.Graphics and sound are terrible as well. Texture pop-ins are a constant thing, even with civilians and guards. Several times, while riding a horse, I ran into guards and civilians who appeared suddenly in front of me that weren't there a few seconds before. Trees, grass, flowers, bushes, rocks, buildings, people, and other objects will literally grow, bloom, and appear suddenly before your eyes as you walk closer to them. There was a constant sound of pigeons cooing for mission 6. Doors opening and closing, whispering, and certain other actions during cutscenes have no sound at all. Cicada's and other sounds of nature were very loud when they should have been background noise. During one of the earlier missions, a child is crying. This could be heard very far away from where he's actually located as if he were right next to me. Characters will shake and spasm violently at times. Many objects and scenery pieces look entirely flat and use bad illusions to seem otherwise. Weapons falling into water have the sound effect of falling on the ground. Ezio's hands go through people and objects, guards go through him and each other, etc. It goes on and on with how horrendous the sound and graphics were here, but ends up being some of the most comedic parts of the game.Like with the last two games, I have many minor gripes as well:- Beggars are back and follow you three at a time like in the first game. Shouldn't Ubisoft want to improve the series and not bring older problems back into the game?- Mission selection still misplaced, showing up after cutscenes and making you choose 'accept' when it's entirely unneeded.- Citizens are shocked you can climb something about three feet high, showing off even further how bad AI are.- AI will drop crates for simply ridding your horse near them.- Ezio and Desmond verbally tell the player they can now climb up again more easily if/when they fall after a ladder or pillar falls, making it so you don't need to start from the beginning of a platforming section again. This is very blunt to the point of breaking the third wall and unneeded as the action is seen clearly with the camera even focusing on it.- The game froze at a load screen twice.- Secluded scenes after major assassinations not needed in many cases this time. They feel like they're still here simply because they were in the first game.- There's a few second wait time after renovating buildings, similar to the wait time after saving civilians in Assassin's Creed.- Horses play a much more important role in the game, such as already mentioned mounted units, but still experience some of the stiffness and flaws they had since the first game.- Map still goes all the way out to show all of Italy despite having no need to do so.- Notoriety still goes up for no valid reason, such as assassinating/killing people when no one is around to see or hear.- Full synchronization challenges similar to PS1 era time and collection challenges, which even then were known to falsely make you feel like you're getting more content in your game.At best, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a rushed cash-in on the franchise, and at worst, it's becoming the Call of Duty of platformers. There was no genuine reason to continue Ezio's story, which is shown clearly by the excuses the game makes along with the many lackluster cinematics and missions, and the few good things I liked in the series are bogged down to the point of being ruined. Instead of improving the consistently flawed mechanics and gameplay, a few small patches, random secondary missions/objectives, and other additions are added to try and distract you from this. The series needed an overhaul since game one, and while Assassin's Creed II tried to fix a few problems, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood does nothing at all positive for the series. A few good missions and a pretty ending aren't enough to keep this series afloat anymore, and hoards of new problems make what was once a series of great potential and promise one that is undeserving of trust and continued support.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Death of the Assassins", "unixReviewTime": 1337385600, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2012"}
{"reviewerID": "A2I2VBKZQ3A413", "asin": "B003L8DXOI", "reviewerName": "Travis L. Chapman \"Anime Nerd\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Ah, Italy. There's just something about it. Ubisoft goes to such incredible lengths to painstakingly recreate 1500 Rome and other cities that one is often tempted to sit and watch for a moment. The teeming masses of people going about their daily business, the intricate labyrinth of the confined side streets that suddenly open up into courtyards where even more people congregate, etc. I'm harping on the atmosphere in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood because I've decided that the environment has become the primary appeal- for the same reason we all prefer certain Grand Theft Auto entries; it's our surroundings that draw us in. Of course, what lies beneath is a bigger and (in some ways) better version of last year's Assassin's Creed II, and that's sort of important. It may not take the same giant step forward as ACII did in comparison to the original title, but there's no doubt that if you loved ACII, you're gonna adore Brotherhood.For whatever reason, I note something different in the visual presentation. This one seems to harbor softer, more muted colors and - strangely enough - less overall detail. Now, because the screen-tearing issue that plagued the previous installments appears to have lessened (somewhat), I'm wondering if this minor overhaul was to combat said problem. Big fans may recognize the difference of which I speak but then again, maybe they won't. As I just mentioned, Ubisoft puts a ton of effort into producing a believable, immersive environment that is never devoid of life. Character detailing is still great, the backdrops are downright amazing, and the animations are a joy to behold. I keep thinking we're missing a bit of crispness and sharpness but that might be all in my head... The end result is yet another engrossing graphical depiction that beautifully captures almost every last facet of Renaissance Italy.Wonderful voiceover performances and a fantastic soundtrack once again bolster the sound category, which only seems to be hampered by occasional effect drop-outs. In other words, not every slice of your blade or grunt of a foe is spot-on; in fact, it may just drop out entirely. But considering the sheer number of times such effects are heard, we should bear in mind that it's still a 99% stable audio presentation. And once again, it's the myriad of ambient effects that helps bring the cities alive; we appreciate everything, from the cries of the shop owners to the random civilian conversations. I keep thinking that awesome soundtrack should swell to the forefront a bit more often but as it stands, one can't deny the music's professional quality. And really, the realistic lilt of the Mediterranean tongue is a pleasure to my ears and you can even select the Italian voices if you so choose. Honestly, I could listen to a woman speak Italian for...a long time.Here's the thing about the gameplay, and it's probably the most obvious observation a critic can make: it's really no different than ACII. I believe this may be the reason some sources have given scores well below what Brotherhood deserves (although I see 9s are still the norm). In truth, not all the additions really seem like big steps forward and as soon as you work past the opening sequence, it will feel very much like you're simply revisiting the game you played last year. Even the inclusion of your assassin friends don't represent a large advance or departure; for most of the game, they're little more than tools for Ezio. Plus, the storyline seems a bit more muddled. In ACII, it was an emotional, gripping plot that involved Ezio's family, a desire for revenge, and a mysterious secret of humanity worked in for good measure. Well, that secret is back and more mysterious than ever but the rest...eh, it seems a little erratic to me.But let's start at the start, shall we? Brotherhood picks up right where ACII left off and although Ezio opted to let his target escape, he has completed his mission and everything is right with the world. His sister, mother and uncle remain safe at the villa (the one you restored in the previous entry) and although the Borgia threaten everyone's way of life, Ezio and Co. are happy. But the slightly older hero barely has time for one of his patented rolls in the hay - with a beautiful and powerful woman who has a ridiculous amount of influence - before everything goes to hell. I won't give anything away but let's just say Ezio must re-embark on yet another quest and this time, the future isn't so clear. On top of it all, we're reminded that Desmond, the modern-day descendent of Ezio and Altair, is working with the descendents of the assassins. And now, Desmond is starting to take some cues from his ancestors...The free-running is back and if you mastered this flowing form of platforming in ACII, you'll still be quite competent. Nothing much has changed; it's still the same effective, efficient, and surprisingly accessible mechanic it was last year, although one should note this mechanic was greatly refined between the first title and ACII. But hey, I don't think it needs more refining. The combat is about the same as well: you can lock on to a foe with the L1 button, dodge with X, and hold R1 to defend and prepare yourself for a counterattack. Choosing weapons and items is as easy as holding down the R2 button to access the selection wheel; when you do this, by the way, the game pauses and I love that. You can still execute a counterkill by entering your R1 stance and hitting the Square button the instant an enemy goes into his attack animation. But here we get to one of the new battle additions that, while not a game-changer, remains a significant upgrade.You can string together counterkills by angling the left analog in the direction of another soon-to-be victim and pressing Square. The kill chain is flashy and great for taking down a large group of enemies fast, but you have to remember you're open to attack during the chaining process. On top of which, your opponents can now grab you from behind, which can halt your assault in its tracks. It can get pretty annoying but you only need to hold the L1 button and hit the Circle button rapidly to break free. This latter addition is one of those, \"eh, I suppose\" features that I'm not sure we needed. It's a great idea, to be sure, but as the game has to give you a chance to break free, the enemies just stand there and watch you being held. It just looks silly and seems to detract from the flow of battle. You can grab enemies, too, but that's not a big surprise and it can actually be effective.The other new stuff- a set of virtual training challenges in the Animus, which can be used to fine-tune your free-running, stealth, location and combat abilities (and you can try to top your friends' best tallies), the Borgia Towers, which - along with the death of the Captain of the territory - must be taken down to free a certain territory, the renovation of recently freed shops, the addition of banks, the factions and friendly assassins, the specific requirements for 100% full synch on certain missions (i.e., don't drop below one health square, kill the Borgia captain by throwing him into the scaffold, etc.), and oh yes, the multiplayer. I'm not the biggest fan of multiplayer action but when it comes to Brotherhood, one has to appreciate the different style. This is no shooter and carrying out assassination contracts is tougher than you might think. It can get a little repetitive and I don't think they did quite enough with the multiplayer option, but even so, it works out fine, and I only noticed a few minor online glitches.Perhaps one will view the inclusion of the Brotherhood as a little lackluster and not nearly as prominent as initially believed. This is understandable because in reality, as I said before, it doesn't have a huge impact on how you play the game. Having the option is nice, and doing some extra micromanagement - i.e., sending your loyal subjects off to gain some experience - is sort of entertaining, but it's really just another tool for Ezio. In this way, I suppose someone looking for more of a team-oriented approach would indeed be disappointed. But that's not how I'm looking at it. In my eyes, this series was built on the bad-ass lone-wolf philosophy and that's exactly how it has remained. You know what the biggest difference is between ACII and Brotherhood? Simple- there's just more to do in this one. How is that a bad thing? I could complain that a few of the additions don't vault AC to another stratosphere but in my eyes, it's plenty high enough as is so let's not quibble.There's just a ridiculous amount of stuff for the completionist. It's not just about feathers, flags and treasures; it's about getting 100% synch on every memory, it's about taking down every Borgia tower and renovating 100% of that particular area, it's about the multiplayer that offers something blessedly new, it's about even more tools and techniques for the main character, it's about completing all the intricate puzzles to learn \"The Secret.\" If you want to do absolutely everything, there are at least 30 hours of gameplay here, if not 40. And again, I must stress that the atmosphere and presentation puts the game at a lofty level; the meticulously designed environments have always amazed me, the Italian landscape and sonorous voices keep me entranced, the various missions (such a departure from the original title!) keep the experience fresh, and that continual strategic element - \"okay, how do I go about approaching this one...?\" - makes this game a gem.Assassin's Creed II built upon the foundation of the first game, while Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood doesn't necessarily continue to \"build,\" but simply expands. I suppose the best way to describe it is that if the original AC was the foundation of a house, ACII finished up the framing, while Brotherhood supplied the paint and furnishings. Oddly, I did notice a few small hiccups I don't remember in ACII, like Ezio not realizing there's a ledge right in front of him; he just leans over, thinking there's a drop. But then again, a fully completed house does come with a few new quirks. And I swear something is different about the graphics even if I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe all these games are taking their toll. But there's one thing I do know- I love Italy and I love Assassin's Creed.The Good: The liveliest, most satisfying environments you'll ever see. Attention paid to the smallest detail. Beautiful soundtrack and voices. Overall expansion adds to depth and longevity. Great variety. Large amount of historical information adds ambiance. Multiplayer is a refreshing plus.The Bad: Story seems lacking and a little muddled. Inclusion of allies isn't as pronounced as expected. Some lingering technical issues.The Ugly: When suspicious guards lose track of you and go to return to their position, they become superhuman...kinda comical.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Expanding on ACII and improving in almost every way.", "unixReviewTime": 1319068800, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2011"}

The controls are even better tuned than the last two installments in the series, making climbing and jumping around a breeze with very little frustration even for the less coordinated among us (of which I am one.)  It is a continuation of the story in Assassin's Creed II, so if you have not yet played that, I highly recommend picking it up first.  It's very much the same gameplay, and this continuation, as it were, assumes that you know what the story is thus far, and if the bizarre events outside the Animus aren't enough to get you scratching your head, that will add even more to it.  You'll get more out of the game knowing everything that's going on.That said, as a continuation, it's perfect.  The story is good, although I found myself wishing I could use my assassin crew more during the story events.  The game plays a lot like Assassin's Creed 2, but with more to do on the side(rebuilding an entire city, recruiting and leveling assassins, flag, treasure, and feather hunting, and tons of missions from the allied guilds).  For those who may have been frustrated by timed puzzles in the last installment, you'll be pleased to know there are very few time-sensitive missions in this one, with a bigger focus on \"Where the heck do I go next?\" when it comes to jumping/climbing, and stealth when it comes to assassinating.Most of the missions come with a \"100% Synchronization\" bonus for completing them a certain way, and many of them will provide an extra challenge for those who want to kick the game up a notch.  Your reward seems to be the unlocking of cheat codes for going back through the game to play with, although trophies and saved games are turned off when cheat codes are in use, so I didn't really understand the point of them and didn't bother going back if I happened to fail at the perfect synchronizations because of that.I haven't yet tried the multiplayer (I'm a little timid with the console multiplayer experience) but trophy-wise, it accounts for a fairly sizable portion of the game and, I'm told, provides a lot of replay value.  You can also go back after completing the story mode and continue playing Ezio in the Animus for as long as you like, using all of your old equipment.If I had to nitpick one thing, it would be the vehicle combat.  Very few games ever get it right, and it was easily the most frustrating part of the game, particularly the flying machine.  I feel like the mechanisms and controls were just a bit too cumbersome and didn't really fit in with the flow of the rest of the game.  I'm not sure why they decided to add them, whether it was just to spice up the game or if it was really a necessary part of the storytelling (it didn't feel that way to me) but it came off just awkward, and instructions for the use of the machines often coming later than it should, to the point where you're guaranteed to fail a few times before you've read it all and have the hang of it.However, overall, it was just a really great game.  The pacing was great, never getting sluggish but allowing you to take a breather if you wanted from the main plot to do things on the side and explore if you choose.  The controls for movement and combat were perfect; I wish more action games would take a page from this one.  It really makes the game accessible to anyone to complete without frustration while providing challenge through other means to those who can go above and beyond and really perfect the timing and execution of the moves.  The combat is simple enough that you could more or less button mash your way through it, but certain missions may require you to use certain moves for perfect synchronization, or are more time-sensitive when tailing a target and mindless button-mashing may not clear the area in time to move on.  All in all, it strikes a really great balance, and I can't wait to see what else the franchise has in store for us.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best of the series so far", "unixReviewTime": 1291420800, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2010"}

Before I bought this game, I checked out the videos on Youtube and looked through the whole walkthrough (because I play on my computer, and the PC version is released around half a year after the console versions are released). It looked great. The graphics is shocking, and the fighting system seems to have improved tremendously. I also like the crossbow, which allows a much stealthier gameplay. This game seems like the new star in the AC series. Unfortunate, I can't say when I play the game, because:1. A CASUAL-GAME LENGTHED STORYthe main story is pitifully short. Apart from all of the \"freeing Rome from Borgia Towers\" minigames, I spent no more than 20 hours finishing the game. Before anyone tells me this is not AC3 (as someone pointed out on Youtube), let me make my point clear: This is a CORE Game, NOT a CASUAL Game. As such, I expect it to be properly-lengthed (the main story alone, without the side ones, should be worth at least 1.5 days of gameplay).2. MEMORY REPLAY: 10 MINUTES EACHAC:B, unlike AC2, offers memory replay, where you get a chance to select and play through previous chapters again. And this is an excellent design! except that each chapter is chipped into small sections.For example, if I wanted to play through chapter 4, I would select chapter 4.1 and finish it in 10 minutes. Then, I would be sent back to the chapter-select scene (this is not optional) to select chapter 4.2. When I do this, I am thrown into a new game independent of my chapter 4.1 gameplay. There seldom exists a section worth more than 10 minutes of gameplay.3. FREE ROAM IN AN ENEMY-FREE WORLD!Upon finishing the game, your assassin literally frees the whole Rome from Templar control. You walk in a world deprived of all the fun guards and fights; I have never faced more than 5 guards at once after I finished the game. And, because of AC:B's fighting system, each guard fight ends in 1 minute. The only alternatives to wasting time in this boring world are to(1) replay the 10-minute sections, which is very boring, too, and(2) to start a new game (meaning you need to walk through all the boring introductions, trainings, and other missions you don't want to play through again; along with re-earning your hard-won money, weapons, armors, available areas, and trained assassin followers).Overall, without any replay value, this game is worth no more than the 20-hour first-time walkthrough and the multiplayer component, which I did not use. (This does not include the minigames such as guild missions and objectives, which are all very repetitive)***Note: I am not saying the graphics doesn't look very good, the fighting system is horrible, nor that the crossbow is useless. All I am saying is that you are left with little interesting things to do once you are finished with the main story, and it doesn't take long to reach that stage.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Low Replay Value On the Single Player Part", "unixReviewTime": 1312588800, "reviewTime": "08 6, 2011"}

The heart and soul of these games is acrobatic missions through beautifully rendered, historical cities. These are threaded together by story arcs, one for each game, and one that ties the games together. This includes a modern period metastory about Desmond, a descendant of assassins, who is recalling his ancestors' experiences through a machine called the Animus. Each game is about one of those ancestors. The first took place in Palestine and Syria during the period of the crusades. The second game and ACB follow a renaissance Italian assassin called Ezio.ACB takes place almost entirely in Rome during 1500-03. Ezio is engaged in a quest to recover an artifact held by the corrupt Borgia clan. As Ezio, you assinate and sneak your way through various missions on the road to the goal. You also have several side missions, including training other assassins. All the while, you periodically wake up from the Animus to do things as Desmond in the contemporary world.Pros:Amazing environments that put you in renaissance Rome, walking the streets, climbing buildings, visiting the famous sites, breathing it in. This is what really makes the game.In most scenarios (missions), the controls to Ezio/Desmond's movements are intuitive and follow a simple scheme using the keyboard and mouse.Interesting story, even if at this point (game 3) it is time to get some resolution.Cons:The metastory is very slow moving -- only a few days pass in a game. This means that it may take many, many more games before we really understand what Desmond's story is all about. Yes, this is about sales, and it is a bit too blatantly commercial. Is there, in fact, a full story? Or is this like the tv-show Lost?Some scenarios are clearly designed by different designers from the main game. This means the camera is suddenly fixed in place and the layout to Ezio's movements suddenly change. So the gameplay is interupted by silly mistakes due to changes in what keys move Ezio forward, backward, up, down, etc. and without warning.No saves. This means that if you leave a mission half-way through, you have to replay the whole thing.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice sequel to a great game", "unixReviewTime": 1301270400, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2011"}

The exception is of course story line and graphics.  You can climb just about any building,sometimes you have to go around the building finding hand holds, but getting down is fun, you do a leap of faith, jump off the building into a hay wagon or water.  The graphics are soooooo good your stomach will do a flip flop as you jump off the building.  Once you get parachutes, you can jump from any building or cliff and deploy your chute.  In this episode, you get the crossbow, which is helpful to eliminate the guards.  You can follow the story line or diverge a bit which is fun.  There are endless opportunities for income, guard killings AND you get your own team of assassins to assist you during hard kills.  If a mission is too hard, eliminate the Borgia tower before beginning and the mission is easier.I've completed the game, but keep going back to explore different possibilities and the extensive maps of early Italy.  My only complaint is the language, which is totally not necessary, but this series is one of the best and you will not be disappointed.  There are surprises all over that will keep the story line engaging,  can't wait for the next game in this series.BUY this game, you will LOVE IT!!!10/28/11I recently purchased the game guide book.  While it's mainly focused toward xbox and ps3, I play on the computer, it is still very helpful.  What is most helpful is subject 16's puzzles.  Some of the picture wheels don't match up and you have to toy a bit with them, but very useful.Also in the walkthrough is a map listing the location of Borgia flags, treasures and the lairs of Romulus.  The Borgia cape allowsyou to be invisible to guards all the time, however, you must get ALL of the flags to get the cape and that includes the flags in thelairs of Romulus.  Another cape does the same thing only you must rebuild Rome 100% to get that cape.  There are other helpful hints as well.  I've only played the single player game, but find new things to do each time.  I highly recommend this game, it is great.  Another bonus is that you can actually THROW the spears and hit the guards, just make sure a citizen is not in your way.  Need something else to do?

But this time you spent almost the whole game in Rome and its suburbs. Graphics are beautiful. It is awesome to run around the Coliseum, the Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, and the Castle D'Angelo. The building models for these had an authentic feel  and many little details that I remember from my trips to Rome. The designers did a good job trying to put us into Renaissance Rome. There are descriptions of the major sites which talk about how they would look at the time versus what we see now.The storyline is entertaining. I found it even better than the ones before. Challenging game play, but not impossible. Sections have tiered victory condition which allows you to continue even if don't make all the conditions. You can't save wherever you want, but the frequency of the saves seemed adequate. ACB had s similar system as the villa Monteriggioni where you invest in the city to make money.  There are new weapons in ACB. The Crossbow is lots of fun. Basically, a long range stealth weapon. I call it the sniper rifle. The addition of the Assassin's Guild where you recruit and get experience with your own assassins is really neat. You can send them on missions in and out of the city in addition to just calling them to help you. This adds a whole new dimension. Your options are practically limitless with all the side missions and achievements possible. My only complaint is I noticed that the sound and cut scenes are slightly out of synch. This might just be my computer. Regardless the cut scenes are well done.The multiplayer is fun too. There are different methods (everyone for themselves and co-op). You can't just kill anyone you have to find your selected target to get points. You also get points escaping your pursuers and a multitude of other challenges. The points you gain allow you to advance rank and gain other abilities. Multiplayer uses UBISoft's network and maintains your stats and progression.

They didn't remap to a PC's keyboard, all they did was change the code so you could fake being an XBox controller with a PC. Of course the keymaps are stupidly labeled. Like &#34;Eagle Vision&#34; is labeled &#34;Head&#34; and &#34;Run&#34; is labeled &#34;Legs&#34; Also, you have about 10 buttons doing 30 things, and it depends on where you are and what you're doing to determine what those buttons will do, if they decide to do anything, which often they don't. Or, you could be trying to jump to that ledge below, and oops, you just jumped clear past it for some unknown reason and either went splat on the ground of land in the middle of a bunch of bad guys who tear you limb from limb.Now, I think the game could be awesome, incredible, but these are game breaking bugs and a lot of them for me. I've had less frustration on hardened difficulty on COD, or high difficulty on Dragon Age facing dragons. Call this one a waste of 15 bucks and uninstalled.

The overarching story of the 'Assassin's Creed' franchise is those of a young man named Desmond Miles, who is reliving the genetic memories of his ancestors in order to discover how he and his cohorts in the present day can stop a dangerous group from taking over the world. As in 'Assassin's Creed 2', you play as Ezio Auditore, who in the second game sought vengeance against those who betrayed and murdered his family by becoming an Assassin, as his uncle and father were before him. Ezio's 20 year story is set against Renaissance Italy, and the gorgeous recreations of the cities and architecture draw the player in. In 'Brotherhood', we find Ezio, now roughly 40 years old, in Rome, after a surprise attack on his home by the notorious Cesare Borgia, the son of the reigning Pope. To discover why Cesare has targeted him, Ezio must sort out betrayals and kill those who stand in his way, while training a new order of assassins and rebuilding Rome.'Brotherhood' is an addicting experience, featuring platforming, hand to hand combat, and even a batch of puzzles to solve. Exploring is half the fun in this game, as the designers have rebuilt Renaissance Rome, allowing you to explore gorgeous buildings, hidden chambers, famous landmarks (the Vatican, St Peter's, even the Colosseum), all the while training your followers, hunting your targets and finding answers.It is a very fun game, the jumping and climbing puzzles are top notch, while the combat is vastly improved from the second game. If you have played 'Arkham Asylum', the combat is quite similar, with free flowing strikes and easy shifts from weapon to weapon. The story is not terribly complicated, though I will agree with the one-star reviewer who mentioned the absurd shift in tone towards the end of the game. Despite that, I found this game quite entertaining, addicting and filled with the kind of energy that I haven't seen in a game for quite some time. The voice acting is outstanding, and the music is stunning, my favorite track being the sinisterly whispering choir of children whenever a very intense scene is occurring.I should mention that if you were not a fan of the first two games in this franchise, odds are you won't like this one, and in my opinion it's more of an expansion to '2' as opposed to a brand new game.

{"reviewerID": "AWAGSXM9CNZCC", "asin": "B003L8HQ7S", "reviewerName": "An Android Fan", "helpful": [12, 13], "reviewText": "I've got mixed feelings about this game. Having played both of the main previous iterations (I passed over the handheld side games, however) I wasn't sure what to think of this one before I played it, especially considering that AC 2 only came out about a year or so ago. In the end, it does a pretty good job of what it set out to do, but it'd be a stretch to say it did a great job.One of the biggest improvements over AC2 is that, like in the first game, you can replay *every* mission, not just the side missions. Of course, this makes it all the more curious why Ubisoft STILL hasn't updated the second game to allow for replays. A great innovation in the mission structure is the \"full sync\" feature. This time, to get the maximum out of a mission, a certain sub-objective must be met, which can vary from taking no damage to remaining undetected to using a certain weapon to kill the target. This is definitely a great innovation, although the fact that failing this means restarting the ENTIRE mission is an automatic docking of one star. Even if the sub-objective is failed after the last checkpoint and you reload, it's still failed. I didn't let that slide with Grand Theft Auto 4 or Mirror's Edge, so it'd be hypocritical to ignore that flaw with this game. With one glaring exception, I did enjoy trying to get full sync with the Leonardo's weapons missions (anyone who's played the game most likely knows which mission I did not enjoy; rhymes with \"the bank mission.\") There is no reason why we should have to keep on retrying the same mission from scratch and having to completely redo everything that we have already successfully accomplished just to get to the one part that tests our ability to do the full sync requirement. The aforementioned mission is a prime example of this. Also, replaying a mission doesn't allow you to keep a treasure chest if you exit the replay. For some reason, you can keep a feather or a flag you collected, but not a treasure chest.Some other minor gripes include the fact that courtesans still automatically break off to distract guards, even when you need them around to distract another set of guards. Why Ubi couldn't be bothered to fix this problem is beyond me. And what I like to call the \"What the H are you DOING, Ezio?\" problem still plagues this game in full force. This usually manifests itself when you're trying to escape the guard, and instead of running through a doorway, Ezio instead runs up the side of the doorway, even though no path exists. Three games running, and this problem still crops up! Sometimes music will play for a mission, then restarting it means the music is gone.The story doesn't feel as inspired, either; it feels similar to an expansion pack's storyline as compared to the main game. This is at least partly due to the fact that early on in the game, a key ally is killed off, rather needlessly at that. A lot less dialogue this time around, too. It's almost as if Ubisoft decided that the minimalist approach to character development used in almost the entire middle and end game of AC2 was the best way to go with this game. Obviously, the whole concept that assassins are truly this noble, enlightened group of saviors meant to protect us from the evil Templars is just as ridiculous as the Da Vinci Code (search History Versus Da Vinci Code) and the hidden blade isn't based on any real weapon, but the story world is still interesting. It's just that the story itself in this game felt a little bland.But there's plenty to love about this installment. For one, the crossbow is a nice addition. As it makes killing unaware guards far easier, and because that was one major obstacle both games had to complete a mission undetected, I only have good things to say about this weapon. And if you don't like the crossbow, then don't use it. The game's not putting a gun to your head and forcing you to use this weapon, and there are plenty of other guard-killing items at your disposal. In fact, don't even buy it. You don't get it from the start of the game; you buy it at a weapon's shop. Poison can now be used as a projectile as well, so it's actually useful this time around. And while not necessary a must-have, Leonardo's final innovation does come in handy for missions where falling a great distance is a part of the mission, but to get full sync you must take no damage. And those who remember the end of the first game likely remember thinking \"Well, okay, so what happens now?\" The ending for this game will also instill that feeling, along with a healthy dose of \"What the hell did I just do?\" It's one of those things that you won't likely see coming until 10 seconds AFTER it's too late to do anything about it. Kind of the same feeling you get when playing Jade Empire and the major plot twist is about to happen, and all you can do is sit back and watch. Also, do Subject 16's puzzles; it's worth the time spent. Speaking of time spent, this is definitely a completionist's dream, as there is more than plenty to do in Rome, from renovating the city to hiring new assassin recruits, to helping out the friendly courtesans, to assassinating minor targets to collecting stuff; there's no reason to just stick with the main storyline. Although, another major disappointment in this area is that two unlockable capes, both of which are very difficult to come by, both do the exact same thing; lower notoriety to 0%. Why one couldn't be full notoriety and the other 0 notoriety is beyond me. I enjoyed having the Auditore cape in AC2 and retrying the side missions to see how much more of a challenge it'd be to have every guard notice me almost immediately.So this game is definitely for the fans of the series, although people who didn't like the second game for whatever the reason probably won't find much to like this time around either, as it does for the most part feel like an extension of the second game, whether that's a good or bad thing. It seems like that's largely what the developers were going for; to give us another dose of the series while the next iteration is being made, and to that end they do succeed. It's not perfect, but it does an admirable job of what it set out to do. The one and only thing that I do miss from the original game is that when a target was killed from the first Assassin's Creed, each kill had a true purpose. Like in the second game, this is more about just finding and killing the person. You don't take the time to learn more about the target before going in to make the kill, you simply find them and kill them. While I don't miss the STRUCTURE of how you gained information on your target in the first game, it wouldn't be a bad thing to have the concept put in. It should just be a lot less repetitive.In any case, the good outweighs the bad, hence the 3 stars. The full sync requirement loses one by itself, and the other complaints combine into another negative star, so 5 stars minus 2 equals 3.Addendum: Just finished the DLC package \"The Da Vinci Disappearance,\" and I can see why it got so many mediocre reviews. It's not that it's bad, it's just not very good. The gameplay is standard fare for the Assassin's Creed games, which in itself isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't tread new ground or have any big reveals save for the end, which history buffs will smack themselves in the head upon viewing. I get the whole higher powers leaving clues for man to find thing, but there is the slight logical problem that standardized longitude wouldn't be invented for almost another 400 years. Notice I used the word \"invented.\" Latitude of course was always standardized, given that the equator is always the same, but the same cannot be said for longitude. It wasn't until 1884 that the Prime Meridian was established, and that was subjective in itself - Greenwich was picked as the point of reference for 0 degrees longitude because it was the largest seaport yet used in its time. (And like many other things, it was determined by rich fat cats.) So if the course of historical events were different and the PM would have been instead established in, say, Rome, or if Spain never lost its major naval influence and the PM would have been selected for its port, for example, then the same coordinates would be in a whole different area.But the main problem I had with spending $10 on this DLC is the simple fact that the story was very threadbare. Also, the fact that the final mission's full sync requirement is to take no damage - unquestionably the single most frustrating requirement, and especially for this mission - didn't help. It bothers me all the more because I've seen just how engaging the story can be when the writers strive to make a good story, so this lackluster effort is all the more disappointing. Mediocrity is mediocrity whether the game is great or otherwise. But, Revelations is right around the corner, so I am cautiously optimistic that this will be the game that outshines the others.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Assassin's Creed 2.5", "unixReviewTime": 1298246400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2011"}

By that point in the game, I had grown really attached to the characters, the locations, and the story. To see it end so abruptly was disappointing; it just didn't seem like it was the ending Ezio deserved. I'm glad UbiSoft were thinking the same thing.AC: BROTHERHOOD picks up immediately after the ending of AC2, with Ezio Auditore da Firenze in control of the Piece of Eden and everything right with the world. It seems that its about time to settle down and, to his credit, Ezio certainly tries. But the Borgia family have other plans, and their armies destroy the Auditore Villa before Ezio can even get a good night's sleep. Afterward, he is thrust back into the world of Assassins and Templars to retrieve the Piece of Eden and exact revenge on the Borgias.Now, although this is a sequel to a game that only came out last year, don't think of this as a quick cash-in or a rushed product. Get that right out of your mind. This is as much a sequel to ASSASSIN'S CREED 2 as it is a true continuation of the topsy turvy story that ASSASSIN'S CREED 1 began. Of the three games, BROTHERHOOD is the biggest and the best: quality- and content-wise.The main storyline takes place primarily in Rome, where you will spend your time doing all you can to destabilize the Borgia regime. As with the last game, the attention to detail historically, architecturally, contextually...is just insane. Rome is beautiful and just plain fun to run around in. It is also in a state of disarray and has recently been stricken with widespread poverty. The task to rejuvenate it then falls to you.Across Rome, you'll find dozens of shops, monuments, structures and underground tunnels that will need to be rebuilt. Each shop you reopen and each monument you preserve will add to your overall income, which you can then use to do some more renovations, buy weapons and art, etc. This was a really addicting part of the game for me, and it's not as easy as rebuilding the Auditore Villa by any means. It will take you a while, and it's pretty satisfying to see the florins start rolling in and the overall mood of the citizens begin to turn around for the better.Aside from the modest task of rebuilding Rome, you will also find a plethora of sidequests to take part in, some of which will take the better part of an hour to complete, and you'll be rewarded every step of the way.Now, you could still make the argument that not much has changed. You'd be half-right. This isn't ASSASSIN'S CREED 3, it's a continuation with the same engine and gameplay. There are a ton of little improvements to the formula, and it's these changes that make the game. One very big change is the much acclaimed Brotherhood. As you begin to bring down the Borgias, you will be able to recruit assassins to join you in your fight. As long as they're not on cooldown, you can summon these assassins at any time while you're roaming the city. There is something very satisfying about seeing a guard suddenly get pulled off of a roof and out of sight, and then see your fellow assassin take off into anonymity.Back to the story, I really liked how the story's beginning to drive home the fact that Ezio and all of his companions are 500 years gone. It's easy to forget it, but then to see how Desmond perceives the \"ghost\" of Ezio in certain places and finds artifacts that used to belong to the Auditore family...it's pretty sad. A story that takes place across time isn't the easiest thing to pull off, but UbiSoft is pulling it off with flying colors.If the dozens of hours of gameplay in the singleplayer mode isn't enough for you, then there's always the multiplayer. I've gotta say, I was not expecting this to be good, or as addicting as it turned out to be. There aren't too many game modes or worthwhile unlockables to keep you going for TOO long, but I've had A LOT of fun with it so far. I was smiling and laughing and just plain stressed through each game. It's one of the more original multiplayer games I've played in a very long time, and I hope it continues to make an appearance in future iterations.There was only one thing I took issue with: Once again, it was the ending. Ezio gets to continue his story, but it just doesn't end on a high note and almost seems rushed. I still didn't feel a sense of closure or completion, as if there could still be yet another sequel to Ezio's story. That's to say nothing of the complete left field twist ending of Desmond's story arc, which just might make you angry that there's no ASSASSIN'S CREED 3 to jam into your console to keep the story going. I know that's what I'm feeling right now.Overall, this is more of a game than ASSASSIN'S CREED 2 was, and all the more evidence that this is one of the best and most creative video game series out there. Heck, I'd even go so far as to say that this is the best game I've played this year. I was originally so sure that this game would turn out to be a rushed product after only a year of waiting, but I was way wrong. In fact, I hope the next game is due to be released just as fast, because I'm really not sure how long I can wait.Requiescat In Pace.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Time Heals All Wounds", "unixReviewTime": 1290297600, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2010"}

Assassin's Creed was leaps and bounds ahead of the original, and the good news is that Brotherhood is a continuation of that winning formula. Coming out a year after the previous game might make this seem like a glorified expansion at first glance, but Brotherhood is anything but that.The story shifts back and forth between Ezio, returning home to find that war has broken out and his arch nemesis does some nasty things that warrants Ezio's motive for revenge and overthrowing him, and to Desmond in 2012 as he and the rogue scientists attempt to unravel the past in order to escape the murderous templars in the present. The plot is not overly engrossing, however it's the characters that bring everything to life and Brotherhood really excels in this area. Ezio is a compelling character a always, and the game is filled with a rich cast of colorful characters that are both new to the series and returning from the previous game. The difference in this game is that you are not supposed to run through the story on your own; you are expected to recruit assassin's to assist you througout the game and they are yours to summon whenever needed. Sadly, the AI is not spot-on and sometimes they are not as useful as you would hope, but they do come in handy when you are getting slaughtered in battle. A character in and of itself, the city of Rome is vibrant and bustling with interesting and sometimes amusing people. Beggars line the streets, prostitutes beckon you to hire them and groups of vigilantes gather in the public squares, all adding to a sense of realism that made the previous game so endearing. The bulk of the game is spent in Rome, which may feel like a step back from Assassin's Creed II, where you would travel between cities, but Rome is so vast and populous that you'll easily overlook this. The story missions are well paced and full of intense action, and the platforming segments in the shrines are fantastic as well.The gameplay is largely unchanged from Assassin's Creed II and the free-running mechanic works as well here as it did before, so anyone familiar with the game can dive right in. Rome is a huge city with plenty of rooftops, so it's sometimes fun to just run around and take in all the sights. In addition to the story missions, there are various things you can do around town to earn money. Like Assassin's Creed II, there is an economy system here in which you purchase shops and they add to your treasury balance, which is essential for upgrading your weapons and armour. A new addition that's a nice touch are the areas of the city that are under the tyrannical rule of Borgia and his armies, and you can liberate these areas by destroying their towers and killing the captains. This adds some of the most intense and exhilarating moments in the game, since these tasks ramp up in difficulty fast. Graphically, this game is a sight to behold and it is easily on par with Assassin's Creed II. The character animation, cutscene quality and design of the city are all well done and, despite some noticeable pop-in, it provides a wonderful sense of immersion.Like all video games, Brotherhood is not perfect and it does have it's share of flaws. The free-running mechanic is tight and responsive for the most part, but it is not always accurate. There have been several occasions where I meant to jump in one direction and I ended up going the other way, sometimes falling to my death or losing valuable seconds in some of the time-based objectives. This even happens when you are clearly facing a place where you can jump. Additionally, there is some glitchiness with your AI controlled assassins and even some of the friends you need to interact with. For example, they would get stuck in walls, stand there doing nothing or simply teleport to another area. It's not a huge problem, but it does pose some annoyances when you really need things to run smoothly. Thrown in to add a level of challenge, you can now achieve full synchronization by completing missions a certain way. For example, if you complete a mission in under a certain number of minutes, avoid losing health, or killing someone in a particular manner, you will achieve full synchronization and this will add up to achievement points/trophies. Unfortunately, some of the sequences are lengthy and it's disheartening to know that you've failed this so early into the missions. This does add some frustration, but it's hardly a deal-breaker and some might actually view this as a strength.The last thing I'll touch upon is the multiplayer, which is something very interesting and unique. You are thrown into a large area with other players, given a person to assassinate, and likewise someone is after you. The objective is to kill your target before you get killed, and the style in which you do it will determine how well you do. For example, if you run up and knife someone in the back, you've achieved your objective and move on. But if you do it with style and stealth, you earn more points. This is a refreshing change from all of these online shooters that mainly focus on kill streaks, so being a hardcore online player doesn't ensure that you'll do well here. It's definitely something different. On the other hand, the pace will definitely feel slower to those who prefer the breakneck pace of online shooters, so this is an acquired taste. If you don't like multiplayer, you don't lose out because the single player campaign is 20+ hours long and there is plenty to keep you busy.The speed at which this game was released certainly attracted some sceptics, however I am happy to say that Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is every bit as fun, challenging and beautifully done as the previous game. Those expecting an entirely new game with a new plot and cast of characters might be disappointed, but anyone who loved Assassin's Creed II is really missing the boat if they don't pick this up as well.

The game mechanics are similar to the previous installments but they have added more weapons.

Graphics just keep getting better with each release and the game designers always seem to do a great job of inserting \"in game\" facts to access when you pass a landmark. What I've enjoyed most so far was climbing the Coliseum ..... when you reach the top and begin running along the edge there is a great sense of height from above.Weapons have been stepped up, and by far my favorite weapon is the crossbow. It's just a blast to perch yourself up on a ledge and pick off unsuspecting guards at ground level ....... I have been getting a real kick out of doing that.I've always been a fan of Rockstar's GTA series and Red Dead Redemption, but these Assassin's Creed's games have all but taken over my XBox360 now.

Ezio has returned to Rome, and has to deal with the Borgias' corrupt regime. Some cool new characters are added in, and all the ones we know and love from 2 are brought back. The story is great, and the ending will leave you in awe. As the series is known for, the cutscenes, dialogue, and visuals are awesome. The gameplay is much more streamlined than 2, and it's been greatly improved upon. Many tools are available for you to use during combat, and many different strategies can be used. Renovating shops and famous landmarks increases the income of the city, which is deposited in a bank every 20 minutes. You can then collect this money however you please! It's kind of hard to get a lot of money in the beginning of the game, but after you renovate many shops and collect a lot of your income, money doesn't become an issue anymore! The gameplay is much more streamlined than 2, and it's been greatly improved upon. Many tools are available for you to use during combat, and many different strategies can be used. Rome is a big city to roam around in, and there's many things to see and do. These include: clearing out Borgia towers scattered throughout the city (allowing you to renovate buildings in that district), getting Assassination contracts, completing challenges for different guilds, recruiting your own Assassins, ranking them up and calling them during combat, flashback missions, etc. You'll spend a lot of time on this game if you're willing to, and the game does a good job of making sure that there's always something entertaining to do while playing.Although many great additions have been made to the game, it's still essentially the same gameplay from 2, only faster and more streamlined. I have to admit that 2 did some things better, such as the hidden hideout missions. The main missions in this game now have an optional objective, and it is required of you to complete all of them in order to achieve 100% sync. While some may see this as a positive, I don't really like the addition. If you're big con completing the game, it really restricts the open style of gameplay that we've grown to love in the series. It doesn't matter if you've spent 10 hours unlocking the best weapon in the game, you can't use it if you want to achieve full sync in some missions. Sure, they're completely optional, but it's still kind of annoying. You can replay memories if you want to go back and achieve full sync, however. Playing as Desmond was pretty entertaining in the game, although I've always found the story of his ancestors far more interesting. You only HAVE to play as him at the beginning and end of the game, it's completely optional otherwise.Overall, this an awesome game! It took a spectacular game, Assassin's Creed 2, and greatly improved upon it! While some may say that this is just a money grab by Ubisoft, I heartily disagree. You can tell that they worked hard on this game, especially with the visuals, gameplay, story, and atmosphere.

The gameplay is great, as always, although a bit easy at times. But the game balances out the easy combat with VERY challenging missions. The only negative about the story mode is that the story itself feels a little weak in comparison to AC2.The game mostly takes place in Rome, with the exception of a few flashback sequences and side missions, and a few segments as Desmond in the present which are easily the best sequences the series has offered yet. The overall story, not just Ezio's crusade for revenge...im talking about Desmond and the Templar's, and the ever approaching doomsday...is utterly mind blowing again, just as it was in AC2. Rome itself is easiest the single best environment ever created in a video game.

Assassin's Creed 2 completely sucked me in and made me absolutely love the game.  Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood brought a big smile to my face that completely satisfied every impulse, knee jerk reaction to what I wanted from the second one.It starts with a combination of two events.  1) Right after you defeat the Borgia pope you return to your Villa.  This, of course, is where you are lead to your training sequences for the new maneuvers of the game (which incidentally is much easier to use.  instead of going to your Villa to train you can simply hit Start and choose training).  2) You are taking part of the 2012 world of Desmond and your exploration of the Italy of that time, with its typical 21st century erosion on the old world.  Both are fantastic.  I couldn't help but love returning to the world of Ezio and exploring around.  Even more so was the absolutely huge world of Rome, noticed straight away as you pan around to the distances.  This is an absolutely different and way more majestic world than the world of Assassin's Creed 2.  You know that although you will not travel to as many cities you will certainly explore more just by the huge size of Rome.The graphics are amazing, touched up and refined from the last one.  The controls are almost identical, allowing you to jump in to the game with ease.  The added addition of the Brotherhood adds a lot despite the tendency to overuse your assassins and leave yourself vulnerable, when you would certainly want to use them.  Regardless, the overall game play has improved, despite the fighting mechanisms still feeling a bit droll and not to unique.Finally, after trying for awhile with little success I was able to get in and log on to the multiplayer server.  This seems like a problem straight away because it shouldn't take 5-10 minutes to log in to a server, and then the next time you log in a matter of seconds.  I found that after I waited for 5 minutes I had to cancel out and go back in in order to play.  The play itself is a joy.  You play anywhere from 6-10 people mixed in amidst a ton of \"civilians\" for about 10 minutes, stalking and hunting your prey or just straight up chasing them.  This multiplayer has a much different feel than the typical slugfest and bullet ridden multiplayers of other games, simply because you literally have to get up close and personal before you can make your kill.The campaign play is long and worth it, definitely not feeling like an add on and more so like a real stand alone game with its own merits.  The multiplayer is well worth it as well, although not sure if the replay ability will get old or die down, something of which only time will tell.  Add the two together and you have an absolute winner in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.  A definite recommend.5 stars.Update: A direct comparison would show the following.  AC2 has considerably more collectibles than ACB, but ACB's collectibles are much easier to find since maps are made available for any and all of them.  That being said, there are a lot more side quests/missions that you can go on in ACB.  When all is said and done I spent about 32 hours in AC2 and it took about 24 hours for ACB, athough there are still a lot of side quests to be completed (and clusters) and so it will take a bit more time.  With game complete and all feathers, flags and treasures found, I am only at 51% sync, which shows that there are a good amount of hours left to be played.  That being said I still haven't found all the feathers in AC2, and thus could still spend a lot more time there, so it is a wash.  AC2 had 5 cities, plus a visit to the Vatican at the very end.  ACB has just one large city, although you visit several other places on your missions.I found that there was only one aspect that I wish were done differently which would have made the game that much better.  You visit several villas when completing the quests to destroy DaVinci's war machines, as well as Firenze (sp?) and Viana Castle.  It would have been so simple to make these places that you could visit and explore after you completed your mission.  Viana Castle and its surrounding countryside, for example, would have been fantastic to explore and just run around.  Instead you only visit it briefly and you are running and fighting the whole time you don't get to see it.  Additionally, you don't get to climb up or explore around San Pietro.  You see it always in the distance, then at the end you get to go up to its gates and then nothing.  There is the Lair of Romulus that puts you in San Pietro but you are chasing a Cardinal at such a frantic pace you barely get to notice the huge and majestic building that would have been absolutely fantastic to just stop and hop from ledge to ledge.  A simple touch to allow us to explore it after the game is compelte would have made this game that much better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A fantastic follow up to AC2...", "unixReviewTime": 1289865600, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2010"}

This is a great sandbox game with a great story that is able to accomplish all this without drastically changing or innovating.I'm kind of a conspiracy junky myself.  I like good history conspiracy stories so my saying the story is great might be a touch biased.  Even so it is a decent story that sucks you in when it's moving forward.  Of course it's not always moving forward, but even when the story is moving there is plenty to do in this game.  Brotherhood really doesn't change much from AC2, but the climbing and freerunning seem a little more fluid and easy to get right.  There are still the occasions when Ezio shows his prowess by randomly grabbing a ledge two feet off the ground, but that's normally the players fault and is only an inspiration to maybe work harder on your parkour skills.  Which leads me to talk about the many new additions in the game.First is the Virtual Training which was a fantastic idea.  I personally have found that it has actually made me a little better at the game.  It's fun to get the medals, but actually helping is something superb.  The ability to leave the Animus is also a great idea.  I always wanted to see more of the Desmond story in AC2, but realize maybe it wasn't very prudent.  However, in Brotherhood the Desmond story is actually something that is somewhat dynamic and having the setting be at the Villa is just a nice touch.Now for the real deal.  I will go on record saying that this multiplayer is one of the greatest that I have ever seen.  I still like a good fragfest once in a while, but getting blown to pieces on Halo and COD just gets old after a while especially when the perks and customizations are weak.  AC:B took the multiplayer norm and threw it out the window and said \"Slow the hell down and let's actually think while we're playing.\"  The fact that the way you win in taking your time and being patient might frustrate some, but I find it brilliant.  When I only get 4 kills and beat a person with 20 kills is amazing.  This is a tense, edge-of-your-seat, multiplayer experience.  This isn't a passive game and you really have to try and pay attention.  The learning curve is gentle and doesn't just let you get annihilated when you first start.  With patience and a great strategy, you'll win without even trying.The gameplay overall is basically the same as AC2, but the small additions like being able to jump off a huge tower directly to your horse and throwing heavy weapons is something that still satiates the thirst for something new.  The new gadgets also help throw a twist in some of the strategies that you attempt by giving you the ability to poison from a distance and parachute from building to building.  The way that you can build and renovate Rome is fun, but lacks some things.  Getting to the point where you're getting 50,000 florins every time you're withdrawing from the bank is great and the different items that some shops have is fun.  However, renovating Rome falls short.  I haven't finished the game yet, but when I buy a shop and it makes itself look nice, I expected to buy the Colosseum and see it at least clean itself up.  It's nice to see a decrease in the guard presence as you start rebuilding Rome, but I wanted to truly REBUILD Rome.  It's still fun, but I do have a gripe with that.I won't go into much more, but I'll finish by saying that this game is a must buy for the people who want a sandbox game that doesn't include health increases by banging a hooker and hunting wild animals in the wilderness.  The story delivers and I can't wait to see how the whole thing comes together, and I love building Rome while planning out my assassinations and building up my assassin's guild.  I wish they would have added maybe a few more gameplay additions and maybe does some design upgrades, but it still is a great experience.

He is older, wiser and more temperamental, but at the same time it is more sensitive to the situations at hand. I enjoyed playing all 3 deliveries of these game.The story line of this game took me slightly less than the other two because you are freer to complete the story without so much exploration of the world  you are in. For the most part it is in Rome, so travelling from one city to another like you have to do in the previous games would not be a factor to spend time. There are some memories that you will have to re-live outside of the city limits. They're special ones, although only one of them is mandatory for the storyline to continue developing. The rest are to destroy Leonardo's inventions. I won't spoil the reasons or the tasks at hand, but be prepare to innovate as you go :)I found the fighting more challenging than the previous 2 games, and at the same time more exciting. Ezio is older (is what I kept telling to myself), but as he knows more tricks, there are other things that you can do to almost always beat everyone without loosing life.I haven't played the multiplayer platform yet. It looks really interesting though. I am enjoying the exploration part now. Visiting the castles, ruins and secret lairs. I might play with the on-line multiplayer later on. At this point, I am still enjoying the missions left and the discovery.

This is the only game in recent memory that can take a game series improve it and not screw up what was originally great about it. This game took me about a month to beat about 30 hrs in total and I didn't even do everything when I beat it. This game in my opinion only is much larger than its previous installments and they have improved and added a ton of content while still keeping the feeling of the original assassin's creed that made it so great. this game starts off after assassin's creed 2 and continues the story once again with Ezio from Italy. My favorite improvement of this game has to be the kill streak combo's you can perform while being attacked by multiple foes. when you get skilled enough you can kill a group of 8-10 people in a matter of moments. another great feature is the new ability to recruit, train, and use other assassins in your missions they can come in very handy and its just amusing to watch them go to work while you sit in the dark undetected (which you have to be in some missions). This game series has to be played in order to fully get the most out of this game.

He gives it five stars for fun and two stars overall? WTF?\" Well, here's the deal. Assassin's Creed is indeed a fun sandbox adventure with all kinds of things to do. You play Desmond in the modern era, who is, in turn, reliving the life of master assassin Ezio in Renaissance Era Rome. As Ezio, you must start a rebellion against cruel oppressors, the Borgia, and you do this by renovating the city (also making sure that the various businesses and vendors kick some money back to you), destroying their fortresses, and breaking up sinister cults. There are also story missions which tend to be a bit more complicated than those other tasks and can be more challenging. It's great fun, whether you're running about and callously battering bystanders aside, stealing from folks, climbing up walls like a crazy man, or slaughtering guards simply because you can.Then it just might all come crashing to a halt. See, the problem is that like me, you may encounter a game-breaking bug or two in your journey. Myself, I got this strange bug where Desmond kept getting bounced out of the Animus (this is the device that allows Desmond to relive his ancestor's past--it's complicated). There was literally nothing I could do. Without the ability to use the Animus, I could not progress any further in the game. And apparently, based on the research I've done, that's not the only game-breaking bug. Supposedly, late in the game, there's a mission where Ezio relives some experiences he had with someone he loved, and if you try to do that mission you're pretty much done for.It's freaking baffling. Ubisoft had a battalion of beta testers working on this thing. How did they miss these bugs? Anyway, the positive reviews are largely right about the game, but I for one cannot forgive the sloppy coding that denied me the chance to finish this game. Ubisoft may patch these issues at some point, but whatever the case may be, it was too late before I just gave up on this thing.Oh, and Ubisoft?

I only had a couple issues with it, which I believe to be great considering some of the games that come out these days. Fighting guards is incredibly easy. It seems like it has never really been difficult in these games but there is really no pressure to stay undetected on missions that do not require it. The missions that do require it though, are nice as well. also even though it is not necessary in some missions there is the 100% synch for completeing the mission with a bonus condition. You can either just do the mission and complete it or you can do it perfectly to acquire the 100%. One thing that bothered me only slightly was that at a certain point you get a string of missions you cannot decline which leads to the end of the game. I believe this enter set only took me about an hour or so to complete so it's not like it took a huge chunk of time or anything. Even the conditions of the missions I do not see as that bad, although slightly different. I have seen people say that after this it is impossible to complete a certain quest. I do not know what the quest is because I did not do it, but that is a little bothersome for those that do not want to or do not have the time for a second playthrough. Personally I am not too put off since I believe the game is worth the second playthrough. During the story there seems to be a decent amount of repetitive activites in order to complete certain faction things or collect all the items. I find this to be a little depressing but since there is so many different things to collect or complete in a way it's not as bad, since you can shift from doing one thing to another. I don't know if that makes any sense to anyone else but that's how it feels to me.The factions you could control (to a point) were quite astounding. There are the Assassins, Mercenaries, Courtesans, and Thieves. The quests to complete these along with other collection things were the repetitive things I mentioned earlier. Like I said while repetitive, their was enough to do that it did not feel as numbing. Leveling up the assassins was quite interesting. You could have them execute missions and gain money or even items sometimes. Each place has a chalk board with challenges on it to complete and they all have missions. Doing Leonardos missions were quite fun as well. You got to take control of the inventions he made at some point in the mission and wreack havoc on the enemy. Not to mention he makes a few neat things for you. Especially the last thing you get for completing all his missions, which at first I didn't think I would use much... but I really, really do.The actual story is quite neat as well. They left off with an interesting cliffhanger as I think we should come to expect now from this series. There isn't much I can say that wouldn't really spoil it so I am going to leave it at that, but I am looking forward to the next game in order to see what happens. I enjoyed the multiplayer for the time that I played it. I really wanted to complete the story so I haven't put as much time into it as I liked but my first impressesions are quite good. Unless they add some more game types or some type of diversity I can see it as being great, but not as entangling as some other games out there. I havent found any flaws in the system that I do not like, but I may find some later on. It is a very solid system which I think could hold peoples attention for a decent amount of time. I don't think it will be as popular as some of the first person shooters out there and I would definitly not buy this solely for the multiplayer.Overall I think this is an incredibly well made and solid game. It is an absolutely beautiful world and inside of it I have little complaints, which like I said earlier compared to some other games out now I think is amazing. The little qualms I have do not justify a lower rating as I still had amazing amounts of fun exploring and remodeling every rooftop and alleyway of the world.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pretty spectacular game", "unixReviewTime": 1294272000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2011"}

So I reasoned I could save $50 by beating the game as a rental.  I should have bought it when it came out.  Instead I paid for the rental, and even though I beat the game in 5 days, I ended up having to buy it shortly afterwards because it was so addicting.AC3 adding the ability to have a team of assassins to attack guards while you are doing missions and side quests completely changed the game mechanics of the franchise.  Climbing a building on my way to a side mission, I spot an archer...hmmm...what the heck, I command you to die.  Shortly afterwards a couple assassins show up behind him and dispatch him.  Or I am walking through the outskirts of town and see a guard riding on his horse.  Why not, assassins, get him!  so I see one of my assassins running across a house that is parallel to the road, leaps behind the guard, pulls him off his horse, ends him, then rides off on the guy's horse.  I could not get enough of watching my assassins knock people off.  I could spend hours aimlessly walking around the city getting rid of guards.Re-building Rome through purchasing stores, stalls, and stables; as well as rebuilding historic sites versus building a table town with upgrades is another big plus in my book.Another big plus is the challenges they added to sequences and side missions.  If I am to assassinate a major player, I can do it anyway I want, but I can try to do it with an extra challenge of not being seen, not touching water, killing the person while sitting on a bench, or throwing them into a scaffold.  It brought an extra dimension to the hunt whereas AC1 & 2 was mostly hide/blend-in, jump kill, the run like heck.The Leonardo quests were awesome.  Gatling gun on a moving buggy, medieval tank through castles, renaissance flying contraption dropping fire bombs on the bad guys.  AWESOME!!!!Perches to open the map was given an extra level of difficulty by having to assassinate the local Guard Captain.  They completely enhanced the AC franchise to make this a must have game.  Very addicting and very fun to play over and over again.I agree with the negative reviews on the ending.  The ending although somewhat cool was very frustrating.  Platforming on the last sequence also seemed a little buggy in my opinion. I do have to admit that the story is starting to remind me of a Lost episode with a story line that seems to have more questions than answers.

Knapp \"ViperMan\"", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "I'm confronted by an unusual moment in my history of reviewing video games...On November 28th, 2009, I commented that Assassin's Creed II would have fared much better had it been a bit more like Batman: Arkham Asylum.  I felt that the strategies regarding stealth as well as fluid combat which B:AA deployed so well would have fit excellently in the AC Universe.I swear it's like they freakin' heard me.Enter the Killstreak!  A new flick-the-stick-and-hit-the-button tactic in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood that lets you wipe out a field-full of baddies in a few seconds flat.  I'll admit getting the hang of it took me considerably longer than I had hoped, but never-the-less, I got it.  Now I can drop on an unsuspecting group of guards and be surrounded by dead bodies in just 10 gloriously satisfying seconds.  It REALLY IS fun - and for that change ALONE I give this game a higher score than it's predecessor.Assassin's Creed also resuses some ideas of it's earlier games - even the first title - with the inclusion of the Borgio towers.  It's very similar to the \"Templars\" which had to be killed in the first title, but this time there's actually a reason to do so, and you're able to apply more tactics in the process.  No more running up to a guy and trying to kill him before you get your butt kicked - now you can slink across a roof top, watch his motion patterns, weed out his guards, and make the kill.It's hard to comment much else on AC:B because it's still a lot of what we've seen before.  Do missions, unlock weapons, upgrade your character, upgrade the town - there isn't a TON of new content here.  But slowly they're making Assassin's Creed a better game to play, and as long as no major glitches show up, I'll actually finally find myself looking FORWARD to the next title release.And don't listen to your neighborhood Gamestop employee as I did: the guy who told me that AC:B is mostly a multiplayer game and that there isn't much content to the single-player campaign.  I've been playing the main story now for probably close to 20 hours and still have a looooooooong ways to go.I've heard that the multiplayer aspect is complex and rather thrilling, but I haven't gotten there yet, so I won't comment.  I bought the title however with the intent of trying it out with my brother in Nevada, so we'll see how that goes.In the end, I'm satisfied with the direction Assassin's Creed is taking.  Let's hope they keep it up (and that EA doesn't get involved - can I have an AMEN?!)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "They're starting to get the hang of this...", "unixReviewTime": 1291075200, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2010"}

The new aspects: cruising around performing guild missions, taking out towers and training Assassins was also lots of fun.The problem that I had with the single player campaign was the inordinate amount of 'do not be detected' missions. I remember having fun in AC2 where there was a mission to infiltrate a military compound, kill the chest bearer, steal his clothes and assume his identity. There were some tricks to that mission and it took a number of times to get it right; but, ultimately rewarding and still reasonable on the PITA factor. In AC Brotherhood, take that mission and multiply the PITA factor by 20x. There are dozens of main missions where going undetected turns a fun playground into a tedious exercise in repetitive, buzz killing desyncronizations (not to mention the reload times). It is about as much fun as memorizing random phone numbers. You have to try 20 different things until one of them works, make your way to the next bit of cover and go through it all again. To add insult to injury, is it even feasible that dressed as an Assassin you can go into a Cathedral, crash a closed Mass and hide in plain sight by blending with a bunch of bishops?!

{"reviewerID": "A3V6Z4RCDGRC44", "asin": "B003L8HQ7S", "reviewerName": "Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "A game that can be described as \"Assassin's Creed 2.5\", Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes the basic gameplay, graphics, and setting of AC2 and adds a bunch of new features and content for a whole new city.Brotherhood picks up exactly where AC2 left off. Players once again control Ezio, an assassin in Renaissance Italy, as well as Desmond, his modern counterpart who's reliving his life through genetic memory. Most of the game is the same as Assassin's Creed 2 - if you liked it, you'll like Brotherhood. In fact, I'd say a good 90% of the game is recycled. Therefore, it's more important to talk about the new parts of the game.The combat has been retooled slightly. The weapons are the same for the most part, with a few changes. One change is that some weapons are now automatically paired with a ranged weapon - the main weapon connects to Ezio's hidden pistol, while the sub-weapon connects to throwing knives. This allows for smoother combos, and means that you can use a weapon without having to specifically switch to the ranged weapon. Enemies are a bit smarter, too, and will grab at you more frequently (though they still attack one at a time and are easily dispatched by counter-kills).In AC2, the player had the opportunity to invest money into their home villa to make it more profitable and prosperous. AC:B takes place entirely in the city of Rome, and thus the entire city can be renovated and upgraded. This primarily takes two forms: the first is clearing out enemy strongholds, and the second is fixing up shops, banks, and landmarks. One issue I had with the latter aspect was that the only real \"benefit\" of it was to get you more money (which also happened with the first game), and the only real use of money besides upgrades is to upgrade your property, which gets you more money and so on.One thing I did appreciate is the increased number of missions that are actually about \"sneaking\" and \"assassination\", including the previously-mentioned enemy strongholds. There's actually a lot of missions where there's an incentive to remain undetected, find creative ways to approach a situation, and so on. It wasn't perfect, but it was a pretty neat attempt all things considered. A lot of the game's best moments are a result of these missions - almost failing, but then shooting the sentry with a crossbow before he discovers you, and so on.The titular \"Brotherhood\" refers to the brotherhood of Assassins, who Ezio takes command of roughly halfway through the game. Assassins are recruited from the rank of discontented citizens (the maximum number is based on how much of the city you control), and they serve two purposes. The first is to help you in the game world, either by assassinating a target for you (if you select a target and call for help when not in combat) or helping Ezio fight enemies (if you call for help while in combat). The second is sending them off on missions to get experience and monetary rewards.The upgrade system for the Assassins is unpleasantly simplistic: as Assassins become more experienced, the player can assign points to attack or defense. The problem arises because all assassins end up in the same place (there's 9 levels and only 4 points of attack and defense each). Assassins can be differentiated by their names, facial appearance, and selectable colors; unfortunately, when they hit maximum level their new costume means that they lose those selectable colors, which makes them all basically the same.The Assassins felt sort of unbalanced, too. The combat system is pretty easy, so for the most part calling your allies in felt like overkill. It was neat in some sequences, but it always felt more like \"I don't feel like bothering anymore, you guys come take care of this\". The only time I had assassins die was early on, when my low-level recruits blundered into a giant group of guards and refused to run away. Still, despite these issues, they still seem pretty cool: it's fun to chase a guy, almost lose him, and then sic one of your apprentices on him at the last second.Brotherhood also has a multiplayer mode, based on blending into a giant crowd of NPCs while trying to assassinate (and avoid being assassinated by) other players. While it's certainly innovative and entertaining, it also seemed a bit oddly-paced. It felt like a deathmatch, but with more gaps between kills. It was kind of fun, but just sort of simplistic. Once you'd figured out the gameplay, it just felt like doing the same thing over and over - there weren't a lot of evolving strategies or clever ploys to carry out.My main problem with this game is that a lot of the content feels sort of overdone. The new stuff is fun, but the thing that actually named the game (the assassin recruits) is really underdeveloped. Most of the content is just stuff from AC2 over again - your new hideout, the new flags to collect, the new feathers to collect, the new secret lairs to explore, etcetera. The new levels and side-missions really make up for it, but a lot of the content just felt like a slog that I didn't want to bother going through again. Still, if you enjoyed AC2, you'll definitely want to give Brotherhood a shot.Rating: 7/10.We purchased this game with our own funds.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Picks Up where AC2 Left Off", "unixReviewTime": 1293753600, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2010"}

BUT there was a major glich THAT MADE ME HAVE TO START ALL OVER! In Sequnce 8 I was supposed to trail a guy into the Colleseum I failed and then restarted but my target wasnt there. I restarted over and over But I coulndn't. This is because after the 1st mission YOU CANT FIX ARMOR, BUY NEW WEAPONS, OR DO ANYTHING ELSE. My advice is to do every thing before this sequence and get the special armor that never breaks. Anyway I trudged through and did much better than my 1st time around. This is an amazing game and you should definetly buy this game!

I didn't play the first AC.There are definite improvements in ACB. As usual, you get a variety of weapons, armor upgrades, and costume variations. Combat and movement seem about the same (though there are times when your character doesn't quite go the way you want, resulting in falling after a difficult ascent, or getting mobbed in combat). Building up factions, esp the Assassin's Guild, is fun and advantageous. The graphics are at least as lush and detailed, and some great views can be had by climbing tall buildings and looking around.Some folks have complained about the lack of locations; almost all of the game play takes place in the city of Rome. No more traveling between cities. Really, though, the presentation of Rome is vast and varied enough to be interesting. There are crowded city streets, large open plazas, rural areas, and some water to cross/swim. The city also has enough shops scattered about to keep you well stocked. There are places to upgrade, and loot to gather. Like AC2, there are special levels to get the special armor, and another bunch of Subject 16 puzzles to solve. I found some of the puzzles to be a little too obtuse.The main problem with ACB is that there's a little too much of it. I admit that sound ridiculous, but the end of the game is a real slog to get through, and falls into that unfortunate trap of feeling like work. One of the final levels, leading to the big confrontation, feels sloppy, rushed, and thrown together. Worse, you can only choose to ACCEPT these missions. It's like the game is trying to force you through this mediocre chapter. There are lots of great missions and chapters, though, and plenty of optional ones related to factions.MULTIPLAYER: The on-line multiplayer is just like a game in highschool or college I've played, called ASSASSIN. Everyone in the game has a contract to \"kill\" someone, but no one knows who is coming after them, so it's a game of stalk and hide. It's a great idea for a video game. Sadly, it has two major flaws. The first, common in mp games, is there are way too many players who are ranked much higher than you, and have advantages. I understand the idea of leveling up and unlocking items/talents, but it's not fun to be a noob and constantly die. There are supposedly ranked matches, but I've never been able to join one. Secondly, the games are 10 minutes long, and you cannot enter mid-game, so there's a lot of sitting around waiting for a lobby, and there don't seem to be many lobbies. It's too bad, becauase it CAN be really fun.All in all it's a good game, but I think AC2 is better, and I've had enough of Assassin's Creed for a while.

It takes place right after the first second title. You go on to stop the Borgia family by recruiting Assassin's and recapturing the piece of Eden. If you play either of the last two titles, the near end gets pretty crazy as well. The game is pretty decent link since a big part of the game is the added multiplayer they put into the game.Before I get to that, the single player game isn't as long but it offers a lot of stuff to do. This time around you don't improve your own place, you improve all of Rome by opening up weapon, medicine, and other shops to use and to add funds that you will receive by opening up banks as well. You do this by taking over the influence of a stronghold held by the Borgia Family. To accomplish this you kill a leader of that area and burn its tower. This starts off as a main objective and becomes somewhat of a side thing to in order to make their influence less threatening to your presence. As you further progress you will gain the ability to recruit Assassins. You can you use them as you fight to call in as a new gameplay element but beforehand you can send them on smaller easier missions to gain experience to be better equipped to fight.The online portion is pretty creative and unique. There are various modes to play in. There is one where you have to be sneaky to attack your target. While your on the prowl someone else is also hunting you. You don't want to give yourself away too easy so gain experience by assassinating quietly and you keep yourself getting noticed. There is also another were you are in groups. You will be the hunted one round and the next round you will be the predator. Its pretty clever. You have perks and abilities you can use throughout as you get more experienced. You start of with a disguise but work your way up to smoke bombs, firecrackers, a gun, and such that aid you as your trying to attack or evade.I highly recommend this game.

{"reviewerID": "APF9SSKW6U3AW", "asin": "B003L8HQ7S", "reviewerName": "Morgan C. S.", "helpful": [4, 6], "reviewText": "When I heard that Assassin's Creed was going multiplayer I knew it would be a huge mistake.  Nothing in the Assassin's Creed series speaks to me as multiplayer, ESPECIALLY a versus multiplayer.  In single player I had endless troubles catching people running all over rooftops and platforming.  I could just imagine how ridiculous it would be with internet lag and intelligent players thrown into the equation.  Honestly, Brotherhood is a very good attempt at making A. Creed multiplayer, but it just doesn't cut it for me.First of all, the multiplayer does not play like Assassin's Creed games at all.  It is only a mini game.  There is no sword fighting (or any tactical combat at all), only assassination and various tools to help you do so.  One of my favorite parts about Assassin's Creed 1 that hooked me was the depth and fluidity of the sword fighting.  It was sorely missed.  It is understandable that they did not allow multiplayer sword fighting, as that would be impossible to keep fluid with internet lag.  However, it is just ridiculous that assassins are hunting you and you can't defend yourself with a sword (which all good assassins should carry, like Altair and Ezio).  Inconsistencies like these damaged the game's immersion, making me feel like I was restricted from the full experience by these arbitrary rules.  Another inconsistency is that, while in most modes you can assassinate others, you can not assassinate the assassins that are hunting you.  You may only \"stun\" them by knocking them out for a moment so that you may escape.  Really?  I have a blade that I am VERY capable with and I can't kill the number one threat to myself - assassins who are hunting me?  That is... well, I'm sorry, but retarded.  My favorite part about A. Creed 1 was the intense immersion.  This just feels like I'm playing a silly game of tag.A major problem for me was just how much most of the multiplayer modes are dependent on sheer luck or idiotic risks.  In two of the multiplayer modes you are both hunting players and are being hunted by players.  Yea.  Good luck with that.  Inevitably when you go to make your move you will be giving away your position to the assassins hunting you.  It is a complete contradiction.  You want to be stealthy because you are being hunted, but you are forced to break stealth to hunt your target.  Because of this most games are reduced to a mere causal chain of pure chance.  One person kills another, then that killer is killed, and that killer is killed, and so on until everyone is dead except for one lucky remainder.  Rinse and repeat.  Luck of assassin targets and spawn locations are also a big problem.  In Free For All (Wanted) I'm often killed by the same assassin many consecutive times.  Out of pure chance one person keeps getting me as a target AND I keep spawning in his general area.  Fun.  Also, often your target will be snatched before you can reach them, in which case you've probably already given your location away.  This is pure luck depending on the location of your competing assassins and the choices of the target.  For example, if the target is walking away from me and towards a competing assassin, then getting that kill will be doubly difficult - I have to reach the target faster and not compromise my stealth.  This is rather impossible.  And, as it is impossible to know the location of competition, you leave yourself entirely to luck in your pursuit of your target.Aside from all these theoretical problems with Brotherhood, there are very real issues with the multiplayer.  Lag and bugs are serious business in Brotherhood.  It is not rare to see someone \"teleporting\" and miraculously killing you.  Why, just hours ago my friend claimed someone appeared to teleport through an entire wall and assassinate him.  The same lag-induced oddities have happened to myself.  As for bugs, I have seen players (in Manhunt mode) who cannot be killed by any means or stunned with Smoke Bombs, yet they walk around and \"stun\" every assassin who approaches them.On top of all these issues, multiplayer is barely explained in a VERY simple tutorial.  This leaves so many parts of the multiplayer unexplained and players must seek the very small third-party information or simply make uninformed assumptions for themselves.  I have often assumed incorrectly about multiplayer game mechanics, due in part to new players being restricted by the \"leveling\" system.  It makes the mutliplayer infinitely more difficult to learn, as you must reconstruct your strategy as you gain more tools.  Nothing makes sense in the beginning UNTIL you do get your tools.  Then it makes half-sense, but still feels clunky and unresponsive.Oh yes, did I mention that it is insanely difficult to get a game going?  I have waited for games longer than 10 minutes many times, eventually saying screw it around the 15 minute mark.  And don't even try to play with friends.  The wacko system will separate your friends the first chance it gets to fill another game.  There is no integrated support for Xbox Parties to keep your party together.AS FOR THE SINGLE PLAYER...  It is the same quality one could expect from Assassin's Creed 2: thrilling gameplay, decent but iffy story, and annoying platforming exercises.  If you appreciated AC2, I assure you you'll enjoy Brotherhood's single player campaign.  I, myself, am an Assassin's Creed 1 fan.  The open world gave me the feeling of an assassin's freedom, the espionage drove the story with thrilling anticipation, and the realistic characters made Altair's experience infinitely more memorable than the overtly linear story driven Ezio.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Multiplayer is an expected flop", "unixReviewTime": 1294963200, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2011"}

After ACII was released last year I spent hours and hours playing it last Christmas season until I beat it and believe me I had a lot of fun with it. I also beat the first one when it came out in 2007 (around holidays too) and when I knew that they were going to release another one as a sequel of ACII I was really excited but I never imagine that they would improve what it was already great with ACII. I bought the game last friday and as soon as I got home my nephew and I spent 3 hours and a half playing it (we put it away around midnight) Then, Saturday afternoon after I came from work we p{ayed it for about 5 hours and on Sunday we played it for another 7 hours so, if you add up the hours you'll see that we spent around 16 hours playing it last weekend and you know why? because the game is so addictive in any way you see it. If you are already an AC fan there's no point of telling you what you know but if you want to approach this game for the very first time... don't rent it... BUY IT!!! you won't regret it. The story line continues exactly where ACII finished and the way the creators make you feel involved in the game is so amazing. I must recall the scene when the Village of Mario Auditore is being attacked by cannons (one of the best stages ever in a videogame to play with).The reviewers were right when they said that besides the main story you can do A LOT of things too and what is interesting here is that you never feel that those tasks are not related with the game, I mean, you never feel that the extra activities to do are useless or pointless because you notice that everything is so well related with the whole story in general. The graphics are beautiful and you also learn a little bit about Rome and the places that exist there as well as the people you run into the game (you should know that the Borgia family really existed and that the one that was a pope it turned out to be one of the meanest guys ever). The movements from Ezio are pretty much similar to ACII maybe a little bit faster but that's hard to tell.

And really, it's all been said before, so I will keep this VERY short.1) It's glitchy, camera and controls. To the point that you will be aiming at the main bad guy, lock on him, but low-and-behold, it will somehow automatically switch to another character (and sometimes, it will switch to an innocent bystandard). Three games, and this is issue is still present. This caused me a lot of frustration as it makes it more luck than a good set-up and kill.2) The same glitchy aiming, but into movements and performing the usual parkour maneuvers. Again, you try to run down stairs, or jump off a cliff into a pile of hey (which I still don't know how a pile of hey will actually brace a fall from the Roman Coliseum, but oh well), but you will either run aimlessly up an adjacent wall, doorway, or when going for a pile of hay, you will fly off in a completely hay-free zone. I think this can be attributed to a twitchy camera as it will switch on you in annoying manner, where it will be where you don't want it (in a Mirror's Edge manner (which killed my enjoyment of that game as well)).3) Minor gripe, but one that does cause some pretty serious frustration, and that's the extra-circular 100% Sync additions. Some of these are down-right impossible. Like I said, it's a minor one as you may try, and try, and try, and you MIGHT finally get 100% sync, but odds are you wouldn't (take a couple of the damn-near impossible Leonardo Weapon missions as examples). But in actuality, I'd really wish Ubisoft just decided to just let you play the game the way YOU would want to play it (like AC 1 and AC 2), and not have it so that you would have to do the impossible to get 100% in the game.I can't comment on the online play, as I want to first beat the single-player game. But as much fun that the 2nd AC is, this game just seems to be more of a drag...To the point that it looses some of it's fun. I'd just wished that Ubisoft didn't decide to pull this 100% sync stuff, or made sure that the controls/cameras were tight enough to avoid some serious frustration in trying to play through the game.So, I'm going to give it a 3.5 star rating. And to anyone thinking about getting this game. I HOPE that you have a ton of patience, cause you are going to need it to keep yourself from throwing down your controller in frustration, or rage-quitting because of these issues that I've brought up.Good game, probably would be more adept as an add-on, but as a stand-alone, it just was lacking.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "3.5...

There aren't just great aspects to this game, but truly a great game in general.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is the followup to Assassin's Creed II, where you control the secret assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Ezio is part of the secret Brotherhood of Assassin's, which have fought a secret war through the ages against the Templars to ensure that humanity has free will, which the Templars sought to control. The Templars have infiltrated many aspects of power, and thus are intertwined with an oppressive regime bent on ruling Italy (and eventually, the known world).The controls are essentially the same from Assassin's Creed II, and while not perfect (sometimes its overly intuitive where you wind up running up the wrong walls, for example), it adds just enough minor frustration to really make you vested into the game; parts where you are chasing, or timed, you are forced to also slow down and get it right, not just free-run and have everything done for you.The graphics are again, fantastic. Beautiful scenery, high detail without extravagant load times.The storyline is excellent, as far as videogames go, this is one of the most compelling stories told; not just for the main storyline, but the mini story-lines themselves are cheap gimmicks to extend the game, and are themselves incredibly fascinating to experience.If there's any complaint I have of this game, it would be that I miss traveling to different locations like you did in ACII, rather than having it all in one large sand-box area.In summary, this is really a must-play/must-own videogame, with plenty of original content, excellent voice acting, beautiful graphics, and the final polishing which many games lack.

The story continues to follow Ezio and practically everyone who did not die in assassin's creed 2.  With the addition of things like mounted combat, a personal cadre of trained assasins, plenty of sidequests, aggresive attacks, multiple continuous kills, and an engaging storyline I feel safe to say that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood single player will keep you entertained and immersed for many hours.I bought the game mainly for the online multiplayer.  I am not a fan of shooter games and so I'm not sure that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood will cater to fans of shooters, but if stealth, quick reactions, and good strategy are your thing, or if you just want to escape the already saturated shooters norm, then you have a winner here.How would you feel to be hunting a particular person in a large crowd of people when you know that they know someone is targeting them, while simultaniously being hunted by someone you know wants to stick all sorts of interesting peices of metal in your body?  Would it make you feel better to know that your target can disguise themselves as someone else, have counterattack manuevers, and that you don't know what your pursuer looks like?  He could be anywhere in the crowd right behind you, on the roof above you, or casually walking by your side.  Now imagine that there were two, perhaps three such pursuers out for your blood... Welcome to Assassins Creed Brotherhood multiplayer!The multiplayer features 4 game types (ranked or non-ranked), 10+ characters, several maps, your choice of abilities, and a lot of adrenaline pumping action.  Your objective is to hunt down your contract while being pursued by 0-4 assassins (usually 1-2).  Your contract may also have 1-4 assassins following him (usually 1-2).  Who you are targeting and who targets you as well as how many changes throughout the game.  As you assassinate targets, escape from or stun pursuers you rack up points and are able to level up.  Leveling up allows you to unlock new abilities, equipment, colors, and characters. Points are not based on the quantity of the kills, but the quality of them.  One stealthy kill can easliy earn you the points equivalent to 4-6 noisy, chase-type kills.Like any game, ACB has a few glitches.  The multiplayer seems to take an unreasonable amount of time to actually join a session. Times range from a few minutes to over an hour (the upwards of 15 minutes being less likely).  There are some minor glitches too, such as not recieving a contract target, or not being matched well against other players.  Ubisoft has been contacted and are working to resolve the problems.Despite the minor glitches, ACB delivers in single and multiplayer modes and is a great addition to anyone's entertainment collection.  Also a good chance of future DLC.Update:  I changed my internet provider to Qwest, and I can get into games in seconds now.  Plenty of awesome DLC is now provided.

You do not need to play AC 2 to enjoy this game, but you will enjoy it more if you do.High Concept: 10/10Take a character like Batman, make him an assassin, drop him into Renaissance Italy, and surround him with corrupt government and church officials that need to be exterminated for the good of mankind!  Allow this character to become a millionaire and renovate Rome while building a guild of Assassins.Story: 10/10Assassin's Creed Brotherhood has a story within a story. On the outside, you play Desmond, the ancestor of Altair and Ezio, who's hooked up to the animus (a virtual reality simulator) in order to uncover clues from the past to stop a diabolical secret organization by recovering a powerful magical artifact known as the \"Apple of Eden.\"In the Virtual World you are Ezio, an aristocrat who gets swept up in the political turmoil of 15th Century Italy.  A change in the government makes you a fugitive, so you use your assassination skills to tip the balance of power and rescue Rome.  You get your weaponry and gear from none other than Leonardo Da Vinci and you form the Brotherhood of Assassins with Niccolo Machiavelli.Ezio is up against a megalomaniac named Cesare Borgia who wants to rule Rome.  Under his influence, Rome begins to crumble.  It's up to Ezio to cleanse Rome of his foul stench. Through the story, you meet many fascinating European historical figures with their own dark pasts. Similar to the Da Vinci Code, the story may have you questioning your beliefs, researching historical figures, or wanting to take a more active role in the world around you. It's rare that a video game story actually makes you want to rethink history.Gameplay: 9/10The combat is similar to Assassin's Creed 2, but the animations and gameplay are more fluid this time around.  You can kill enemies with daggers, swords, hammers, maces, poison darts, crossbow bolts, throwing knives, a pistol, hired thugs, summoned assassins, and stun them with smoke bombs.  The combat is also very easy.  As you kill one enemy, you can insta-kill others by pointing the analog stick at them and pressing the X button.  You can easily kill 12 guys in 20 seconds and you do feel like an assassin while doing it.Although, the free running is good, it's not perfect. At times, Ezio may jump in the wrong direction and fall to his death. This is extremely rare, but when it happens, it sucks.The Open World:  10/10The problem with most Open World Games is that moving through the world to your next objective feels like a waste of time.  You often spend 2-7 minutes just traveling.  Well, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood has created some interesting ways to mitigate this.This time around, it is a lot easier to get from one place to another in Rome.  The overall land mass is a bit smaller than Assassin's Creed 2 and Ezio runs faster.  You can also go about 25% faster by pressing the Y button to summon a horse, or horse-jack someone.  Assassin's Creed Brotherhood also uses underground sewer entrances as \"Fast Travel\" Spots.  Enter them, pick where you want to go on the map, and you teleport there.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood also rewards you just for playing, so there is NO Downtime between missions.  The main objective of the game is to expunge the Borgia influence from Rome.  You do this by assassinating the magistrates and burning down their watchtowers.  As you destroy the tower, you are free to renovate shops, blacksmiths, and landmarks in the area.  Improving Rome also pays you in dividends.  Every structure that you renovate adds to Ezio's bank account every 20 minutes.  You get paid for playing!Another way to profit from downtime is the use of the Assassin's Guild.  Halfway through the campaign, you get to recruit rebellious townsfolk to your cause.  By using messenger pigeons, you can send your recruits on missions to gain more money for Ezio and XP for the recruit.  It works similar to a Facebook Game.  You scroll through a list of missions with a difficulty rating of 1-5.  You choose which assassin(s) will perform the mission.  The game gives you their % of success and the time it will take to complete the mission.  You press a button to send them on their way.  If they succeed, you get rewarded.  If they fail, they die.  As the recruits gain XP, you can upgrade their weapons and armor.  This makes them more powerful when you summon them in game.  So, as you are running through the world, you get text updates that say:  Mission:  Assassinate a Herald Complete.  When the mission has been completed, you are free to upgrade them and send them on more missions.  This is a really innovative idea with only one drawback.  You have to believe that an assassin can travel from Rome to Constantinople, kill a guy, and return to Rome in 6 minutes.  It's best not to think about it and just count your gold.Missions:  6/10The only flaw in this game that prevents it from being a true masterpiece is a handful of mission designs.  Every Mission in the game has an objective, \"Kill the Magistrate\" with a condition \"Avoid Detection\" and an optional condition \"Kill him with your hidden blade.\"  The optional condition makes the game more challenging and gives you a 100% synchronization bonus.  If you were to kill the magistrate with your crossbow, you only get a 50% rating for completing the mission.  The synchronization bonus isn't really used for anything though, it just makes the game more interesting.Some Missions are amazingly great and drive the story, while others are just plain bad.Here are some tips for Mission Designers:- If the Player can Fail a Mission within 1 second of starting it, while they are reading the objective, it is a bad mission.- If you need checkpoints every 10 meters with a paragraph explaining what to do, it's a bad mission.- If there is only 1 way to complete the mission and 142 ways to fail it, it's a bad mission.- If the Player can fail a Mission because an arbitrary clock on the HUD hit zero, but Ezio still has a chance of completing the mission in the world (he's standing right next to the target with no guards around) it breaks game fiction and is a bad mission.- If the Player can fail a Mission because an arbitrary distance counter on the HUD said you were too far from your target, even though you are in a locked room with the guy, it breaks game fiction and it is a bad mission.- If the whole purpose of the game is to upgrade your weapons and gear and you have missions that forbid the player from using their weapons and gear that they have spent 15 hours upgrading it is a bad mission.  (Especially when there are six in a row.)- If the rules of the mission are inconsistent with 99% of the rest of the game, it is a bad mission.Your mission designs should never get in the way of the Player feeling like an assassin.Note:  The game is broken into 9 Sequences.  After you complete Sequence 7, the game becomes a linear string of missions that you cannot decline until you complete the game.  If you want to do optional missions or upgrade your guilds, do this before you finish Sequence 7 or after you complete the main campaign!!!Multiplayer:  6/10Assassin's Creed Brotherhood features an interesting Multiplayer Mode where you are in a room of 200 clones.  6-8 of the people in the room are players.  Some are trying to assassinate you while you are trying to assassinate someone else.  There is no combat, you just press X to kill them for the most part.  You are awarded \"Style Points\" for your kills.  It is an interesting gameplay mode, but it lacks depth.  As you gain XP, you can upgrade your character and unlock more gear like smoke bombs, disguises, throwing knives, and poison.  The gear is designed to give you a better chance at killing your target or escaping from your pursuers.  If an assassin is about to take you out and you see them coming, a B button icon appears above their head.  If you press B you have a chance at punching them in the face, and stunning them to escape.  There is a problem though.  Pressing the B button doesn't aways work.  I'm not sure if it is a latency issue or what, but it just seems odd that the game tells me to Press B to escape, I press B, and die.  The game should give the player a 1.5 second invulnerability window to press B and escape.  60% of the time that I press B, I die.  Games should never kill the player if they do exactly what they are supposed to do.There are also some team modes where you work in groups to take out another team and they try to take out your team.There are a few major drawbacks to the Multiplayer Modes.  The wait times to actually join a game can be from 1 to 40 minutes long.  To make matters worse, you can't do anything while you are waiting to join.  You can't organize your gear, set your preferences, study the map, research the complex scoring system, choose the map that you want to play on... nothing.  You just stare at a static progress screen.  There are also a few problems with assigning targets.  This is a major problem because the only way to score points is to escape assassins or assassinate other players.  I've had 3 minute stretches of a 10 minute match where I wasn't assigned a target and nobody was sent after me.  I could only wander around the level and watch everyone else outscore me.If you can actually get into a game, the Multiplayer is pretty fun, but you can tell it's very rough.  It's very simple and rewards you for playing, but it lacks the depth needed to keep people hooked for months.Graphics: 10/10One of the best looking open world games of all time, in terms of art direction and quality. The environments, characters, effects, and animations are all phenomenal. The highly detailed buildings, clothing, and props all realistically fit the world. The characters look and animate great right down to their facial expressions. It actually feels like you were transported into 15th Century Italy!!!Sound: 10/10The sound track and sound effects are amazing. The music is appropriate for the setting and gives a sense of action, mystery, and danger. The sound effects put you right into the action or they'll make you want to seek comfort in the shadows as you stealthily plan your next assassination. The soundtrack is also available on itunes!!!Replay Value: 7/10Assassin's Creed II offers 12-24 hours of gameplay, which is especially impressive in this day and age where most action games are 7 hours long. After you finish the game, you have the option to keep everything that you've earned and continue playing to collect items, finish side quests, or unlock achievements. However, there's no reason to start the game over from the beginning. Even with limited replay value, you're still going to get your money's worth.  There is also a multiplayer mode where you assassinate other players and gain XP to upgrade your characters.Overall: 8.5/10When the concept, story, art, and music are all amazing, you have a very immersive world. The criticisms about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood are that it doesn't offer much of a challenge, and 10% of the missions are unfun.Buy it if you liked Assassin's Creed 2 or Prince of Persia.Buy it if you like fun and easy games that constantly reward you.Buy it if you want a thinking man's Action RPG.Rent it if you want to try it out and have about 15 free hours.Avoid it if you like a challenge or hated everything about the original Assassin's Creed.Avoid it if you are EXTREMELY Catholic. The portrayal of the Vatican may upset you.Avoid it if you don't like the idea of being a dude, who's playing a dude, who's playing another dude.And there you have it. If you can't trust a guy whose name is Poisoned Blade and dresses like an assassin (seriously look at my profile pic) then who can you trust?", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Brotherhood is Hella Good!", "unixReviewTime": 1293840000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2011"}

Brotherhood will answer that. Note, this is NOT Assassins Creed III. This is still Assassin's Creed II and it leads up to what happen after AC 2. Now i was really shocked on how addicting and the quality of the game came out to be. This is my honest review on Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.Plot + SettingThe setting takes place in 2012 (playing as Desmond) and 1503 in Roma (playing as Ezio Audtiore). Brotherhood takes place right after Ezio exits out of the vault. After meeting a familiar face, he returns to the villa to relax  but something happens to Ezio once again and after years of fighting for punishing the people who killed his family in AC II, he is force to hunt down his enemies. The game also includes repress memories (Ever wanted to know how Cristina (Ezio ex-love) and Ezio ever met up?)Gameplay + MechanicsThe gameplay has greatly improved. You can now combine attacks to kill your enemy. For instance, Ezio will have his longsword out and have his hidden gun in his other hand. If your a little rusted on your combat skills, Brotherhood has a virtual training game where you can brush up your skills if needed. Also whats a great add on to this game is that you can now relive events that you already did during the story (As the samething occurs in the first assassins creed). During the course of the game, you can have other assassins with you during the game. This is a great add-on and keeps the game going. You can have up to 13 assassins with you. Now whats great about this is that the assassins will come in handy during situations. If your on a mission where you cannot be detected and you see guards all over the place. You can call the assassins to kill the guards for you. You can also send them on missions to level up and get better equipment. Now as for the big update, this game has multiplayer. Great add on and highly addictive. There are three modes. Wanted (Free for all), Manhunt (2 teams. One hides and the other teams hunts. There are two rounds so the opposite team can hide/hunt.), Alliance (three teams.) The great thing about the muliplayer is that when your hunting someone, there's sometimes people one or even four people hunting you. For example, your playing a round of wanted. You have four other players who are trying to find you while you have to kill your target ( There will always be a picture on the top right of your target so you can know what he or she looks like). You see your target and you run up to him and kill him. Little as you know, there's a person waiting for you to kill your target so he/she can kill you. You will always be on your toes when playing this game and it will get very repetitive. Either way, you will have a good time when playing this game. Note: for muliplayer, you cannot splitscreen.One of the best features in the game is that Ubisoft release three DLC's which two of them is free. The two that are free contain new maps and new modes. The last one which is called Da Vinci Disappearance is 800 microsoft points. The overall DLC is about Da Vinci suddenly getting kidnapped by a mysterious cult. It's up to Ezio to find Leorando by searching for clues all over Rome. Including the DLC is an upgrade for the multiplayer which is a nice little treat. The map comes with two new maps, three new characters to play and one new mode. All for 800 points? Sounds great to me!The only downfall of this game is that this felt like a DLC. The single player campaign has 20+ hours into it and it almost didnt feel like a whole game. I felt like Ubisoft should of add-on this to Assassins Creed II.Overall+ Great Storyline! Highly addictitive, rich and detailed.+ Muliplayer+ Recruit Assassins+ Top-notch combat+ In depth characters emotions+ Replay value high- Feels like a DLC.- No splitscreen in Muliplayer", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Assassins Creed Brotherhood", "unixReviewTime": 1293840000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2011"}

They all test my powers of eloquence, and all the verbal embellishment probably isn't necessary to communicate the simply point that this game is absolutely, staggeringly, phenomenal.All the narratives in my head end up something like this in structure: \"First was good, second was great, third is absolutely dazzling, and here's how & why.\" Instead of writing a novella about spoilers (others have taken care of this) I will instead, simply, relate a few relatively discontinuous thoughts & observations:- It's bigger & better, more detailed and more involved than AC-II, by far. Storyline, open world, texture qualities and effects, cinematics. And as mentioned above, AC-II was already \"great\" in my book - top-5 game of all time. This one slides in to an easy #1 spot for me.- There are more types of side-missions involving more types of secondary characters.- It has better fighting dynamics, better moves, and generally speaking, superior (and more gleefully enjoyable) @$$-kicking.- The artwork, in terms of realism, detail, variety, and sheer staggering scale, is to my knowledge unprecedented in gaming. This map is so big and so detailed it literally could (and I would argue, SHOULD) provide a virtual world for use in other games - like leasing a hosting platform, they could realistically license this virtual world as a commodity and allow other studios to create new stories, themes, etc, in this world. I would love to see / do more in this world.This game really takes everything that was already great in the second game and makes it even better, more elaborate, and immersive. You definitely don't need to have played the first or second one to enjoy this game; really, it may just make some parts of the story line being continuous and making a little more sense right out of the box. And obviously, playing the earlier games will help you enjoy the 'saga' of the storyline. However, within a couple of minutes, you get the hang of everything anyway, and a couple of minutes after that you're just totally immersed in this game anyway.Buy it.

You are Desmond trying to escape the modern day Templars. You find a new location to setup the Animous and continue going through Ezio's memories. Ezio starts off where he ended in ACII trying to escape the guards. You take on the Templars and their allies the Borgia. The story continues in Rome.Gameplay: Similar to ACII, you take on missions that advance the plot, and various side missions, such as viewpoints, setting up guilds, finding flags and treasures, rescuing citizens, taking down Borgia towers, etc. The difference in this game is that after you destroy 15 Borgia towers, you can then recruit and train new assassins. You can level them up by sending them on time-based missions throughout Europe. You don't actually see the missions, but you find out the results. The success rate is determined by a percentage you are given based on the number of assassins you send, and the difficulty of the mission. You can reach 100% success if you send enough assassins. Some missions require max level assassins to complete. You can use them in real time by calling on them to assassinate and aid in combat. Like in ACII in the city of Monteriggioni, you can invest in Rome, buying and renovating buildings, shops, adding paintings, etc. and collect the extra amount of income earned from the upgrades at any of the banks around the city. Leonardo is back to help you again with inventions and upgrades. Some of the new weapons include poison darts, a crossbow, and the ability to pick up and use heavy weapons after an upgrade is purchased. You can now ride horses in the city and initiate horse-based assassinations. Stealth still has a role in this game, though not to the extend of AC or ACII. You can still use groups, benches, haystacks, etc. to hide in but unless your wanted level is high, the need to blend in is minimal. The ability to move throughout the city has never been easier with quick access to roof tops using merchandise lifts or using a tunnel system to get from one point of the city to another instantly.Multiplayer: AC:Brotherhood is the first game in the series to feature a multiplayer mode. The players are Templars in training at the Abstergo facility. They use the animi seen at the beginning of ACII to access memories of old Templars and to acquire their skills using the \"bleeding effect\". Eight game modes total; Wanted, Alliance, Manhunt, Chest Capture, Advanced Wanted, Advanced Alliance, Escort and Assassinate. The different maps include the areas from ACII and brotherhood like Florence, Rome, Castel Gandolfo, Siena and Mont Saint-Michel. Stealth is a major part of multiplayer. You must hunt down targets while being hunted yourself. You earn points by performing assassinations, defending yourself, getting bonuses or completing certain objectives. You can level up in multiplayer which allows you to unlock rewards by earning experience points during the matches and gaining new levels. You can unlock abilities, perks and streaks. Abilities can be used again only after a cool down time, perks can be equipped before the match and they are active all the time, while streaks are bonuses awarded for reaching certain number of successful or failed contracts.Conclusion: Controls are fluid and easier than ever to use. Both the story of Ezio and the story of Desmond advance in this game. I look forward to the conclusion of Ezio's story in next installment, called Revelations. Multiplayer is shockingly good and well thought out. The AC series is one of my favorite and I would recommend this to anyone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Definitely worth the purchase", "unixReviewTime": 1298419200, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2011"}

ACII Brotherhood is probably the most amazing example of this, as, had I reviewed it a day before yesterday, I would have been raving about the most amazing game of the year and showering it with praise.Sadly it's not that and there's specific reasons for this which I will get to.Before I do though, I guarantee that my review will get lots of '0 out 100 people find this useful' type votes from folks who simply disagree with my thoughts, or have yet to experience the last two sequences. And well I'm prepared to take it as I feel this game could and should have a been a five star game across the board but it isn't and I think information is key so let me get to it...I reviewed both AC1 and AC2 sometime back and loved them both; AC1 for what a new franchise that brought a lot to the table and AC2 for taking the budding seeds of the first and building a majestic tree out of it. With Brotherhood things start off so well with Ezio continuing where AC2 left off in Rome and yet the game manages to cram a whole bunch of new stuff to find and do. And boy is there a lot of terrain to explore and things to collect - an area many times bigger than the biggest of AC2. Plus, since you can now purchase and upgrade buildings you're literally changing the face of your environment. This is especially true when you begin to repair the aqueducts which in turn will allow you to get to areas that are physically unreachable even though they're in your current 'memory sequence'. There's more though - you have a horse at your disposal which you can call at anytime and, most impressively, you have a crew of trainable assassins ready to aid you in your quests. The upgrade system for both yourself and your cohorts works beautifully; when they're out on missions they're unavailable but when they return they're stronger and more powerful thanks to distribution points you can spend on them. Not only that you can select them to go any missions which will specifically reward you with items which can be traded for treasure maps and so on. But there's even more, shops can but upgraded and fast travel points can be opened, and you can even buy landmarks all of which will increase your income allowing for even heftier purchases. It's all so smooth and simple yet so addictive. If you loved all the stuff you could do in AC2 then you'll be in heaven with AC2:BH.So, I was gutted when I reached sequence 8.I'm not going to spoil the plot for you but I will spoil the game. Once you reach Sequence 8 all logic is thrown out of the window. Everything you have done up to this point was... pointless. For the most part, your only weapon is a silly sci-fi piece of nonsense totally out of keeping with what has happened up to that point and it actually takes away your health to use it. This makes it kind of tricky to do the missions where you can't lose health, by the way. Oh and your health now magically recharges even though it hasn't before in Brotherhood. It gets worse, much worse. Your Assassins, which you may have spent hours getting to Level 10 cannot help you at all for no apparent reason, you cannot use ANY of your weapons or your health vials, your poison, your skills or indeed be able to free roam.I'm not kidding.And then the killer - Sequence 8's missions dictatorially flow from one to the next. There's no option not to take the next mission, just hit (A) to accept. And it goes on and on and on. When playing these sequences I desperately wanted to just be thrown back into Rome so I could complete some of the earlier quests but you don't get that option until you complete the game in what is now a linear frustrating pile of junk. Gone are the wonders of Rome and its amazing free expansive experience, only to be replaced with silly cutscenes and very limited time missions which were very unpleasant to play. It feels rushed, like the devs had run out of time and that's exactly what happened. But you continue to the end just so you can go back and do the missions and collect the items that you missed. But what's the point of doing that when you know it ultimately boils down to the last two god-awful sequences?To add salt into the wound, since you can no longer leave the animus once the game is complete you will miss a vital collection quest in the current time which is not returnable to. So unless you do that optional quest before entering the final phase of the game, you actually would have to start a new game just to get 100% completion and reap the achievement.So with AC2:BH you need to think of it much like the tastiest pie you've eaten, but unfortunately about 80% into it you suddenly realise it was full of bugs and was rushed to bake in a dirty oven. When that happens you don't remember how good the pie was up until then... you think 'urgh that pie was awful and I wouldn't eat it again'.I don't give out 1 stars lightly, especially on a deservedly lauded franchise like AC. Clearly massive amounts of time was spent making the world of AC2:BH amazing to romp around in and enjoy.But I cannot forgive the ending sequences and I doubt you will be able to either.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "1 star - surely some mistake?", "unixReviewTime": 1290643200, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2010"}

In the game you travel to different missions and have to do things like cross a falling bridge, dive down into the ocean and unlock a porthole, duck under bridges while jumping over holes - there really is a lot to do in this game!  There are 24 themed activities (jungle, western, underwater, snowy, and more) to complete and explore.First you choose your journey and amount of players you want.  My favorite is the Treasure Adventure, which stars you as a treasure hunter who has to accomplish tasks to open up new lands to find treasure on.  You also talk to villagers and learn tips and secrets!  Next there is Free Play, which is where you pick from the 24 games, set the difficulty, number of players and then try to get the highest record in the game!  Free Play is great if you just have a few moments to play and want to release some energy, or want to compete against a friend in a quick match!  Party Mode is the next journey and you can play with up to 8 players in 20 rounds.  You can choose a Quick Game or a longer game - you do obviously have to take turns with 8 players!  The Treasure Room is where you can try on new outfits, check your medals and times, and more.  Finally there is Treasure Trials, which you select your skill on and choose which Trial to conquer.  This journey has different games that you have to complete in a certain order to become a master hunter and unlock new content.The first time I played this game I was so out of breathe and couldn't believe how much of a workout I was getting from a game!  Most of the movements are walking in place, running in place, jumping, and tapping certain arrows with you hit or hands.  Yes you do use your hands!  For example, one of the activities has you running through a island and you have to run, jump, and use your hands to touch the top arrows on the mat to simulate ducking!  Now what is really nice is each activity has a quick description on what buttons you use, how to play, and the difficulty rating.Overall I really like this game and can't wait to play it with more players!  It is also as easy or hard as you want it to be.  For example, I set up the game where you have to run in place and cross the falling bridge and my son and the 4-year-old neighbor had a blast running on the mat.  It really gets you and your family up and moving, and all in some healthy competition!  I also read that you can use the mat with a few other games right now including XX.  If you already have the mat, you can also buy this game separate.  Active Life Explorer is such a fun and different game that is definitely different than just using the Wii Balance Board since you have more movements you can do and that you can have two players on the mat at once!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very fun and gets you moving!", "unixReviewTime": 1292803200, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2010"}

The game was a collection of 15 fun activities, and the game came with its own proprietary mat which had a clever layout of four buttons in blue and four buttons in orange, which could be used by one player or by two players standing next to each other. It was a well-designed and highly successful game.In 2009, they followed it up with the less successful Active Life Extreme Challenge. This was not a great follow-up to the original. The graphics were subpar to the original, and the activities seemed uninspired.So the question became: after a sophomore slump, would Namco return the series to its former glory with Active Life Explorer, its third installment?The answer is a resounding YES.Active Life Explorer is a game which captures the fun and whimsy of the original, while also introducing enough improvements and innovations to breathe fresh new life into the series.The game has an \"Indiana Jones\" theme. All of the activities center around an adventurer as he goes around the world looking for treasure. What I like about this game is that the developers didn't just use this theme as a mere backdrop--they very thoughtfully designed each game so it captured all the drama and excitement of the adventure. Here are just a few examples:Runaway Train: This is a load of fun. Your mission is to stop a train travelling at breakneck speeds towards a cliff. You start by running as fast as you can on top of the train (running in place on the mat) , ducking (bending down and putting your hands on the mat) as the train goes under obstacles, and jumping to get from car to car. When you get to the front car, you need to move your feet as fast as you can to pull the brake lever and shut the train down. There's real drama as the frantic music plays in the background and you see the speeding train on the tracks heading towards its doom!Mummy's Tomb: This is one of the more clever games that incorporates both running and video game skill. Your mission is to run away from mummies while lugging all your treasure out of the tomb. After running a while you'll encounter some gates, which you'll need to close (by alternating your feet) and lock (by pressing the correct button sequence shown on the screen). While all this is going on, the mummies encroach. You then come to a locked gate, which you'll need to unlock by pressing the correct buttons in a spinning roulette.Jungle Vine Ruins: Remember that old arcade game \"Jungle Hunt\" where your character would have to swing from vine to vine, like Tarzan? This is the same idea, except you're seeing things from the character's point of view! Run as fast as you can by alternating your feet, jump off a cliff to reach a vine, and then time it so that you jump to the next vine. This one is a blast.I don't have the space here to review the other 21 games, but suffice it to say the vast majority of them provide both great fun and great exercise. You'll experience everything from trying to stay ahead of a collapsing bridge, leading a dog pack in the snow, and avoiding attacks in shark-infested waters.Here are some of the things I liked most about this game:1) There are 24 different games on the disc. On the Wii this is ordinarily a warning sign, as many Wii game publishers who do this end up pushing \"shovelware\" to the public. Not so with Active Life Explorer. What is impressive about this title is that every single one of the games seems well thought-out and well-designed. There is not a dud in the bunch.2) The controls are all extremely intuitive from game to game. A clear tutorial is provided for you before you start each game, but in most cases you'll pick up on what you need to do quickly. This is critical for a game that kids will be playing.3) Overall, I found the accuracy of the controls to be improved over Active Life Outdoor and Extreme Challenges. And get this--you can actually jump on the mat! (This is a pet peeve of mine with the Wii Balance Board).4) This is a fantastic family game where multiple people can play together. Some of the games have \"co-op\" mode where two players have to work together to accomplish a goal. In other games, anywhere from 2 to 4 players can compete head-to-head (they each take a different side or corner of the mat).5) It really is great exercise. After I played through all 24 games I was out of breath. I can only imagine when families and friends play together and the competition gets intense, that families will get exercise without even realizing it.6) The graphics are beautiful. It's still a Wii, so the graphics are still cartoony. But the game developers did a great job of design, from the bright red molten metal in Mine Cart Mayhem to the beautiful colors of the coral reef you scuba dive through in Pirate's Treasure.7) Most importantly, the activities are FUN. Clearly a lot of thought was put into designing these games. If you enjoyed the \"Obstacle Course\" in Wii Fit but found it much too short or too easy, you should find many of the activities in this game rival that.8) There's a \"Treasure Adventure\" mode which combines all the various activities together in the form of a story. As you play through this you experience increasingly challenging activities and earn different \"treasures\". Makes for a fun and interesting exercise regimen.I honestly don't have many negative things to say. The only things I would think to improve are:1) The game only supports use of one mat. With four players sharing one mat it becomes pretty crowded. It would have been nice for them to support at least two mats.2) Some of the activities are quite short. I would have liked to see some \"extended\" versions of the activities for those who want to have longer exercise time.3) After each event you earn \"Exercise Points\". It's unclear to me what this means. I think a simple calorie count would have been best.Overall, I am very impressed with Active Life Explorer. It is currently the king of the hill as far as fun and effective titles where the whole family can play together and maybe get a little exercise in the process.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Active Life Series is Back", "unixReviewTime": 1287532800, "reviewTime": "10 20, 2010"}

After playing Mario Party 8 and Wii Party for months, I was looking for a change. This game looked great but I was very surprised at the amount of \"exploration\" that is required to get from game to game. It is often necessary to spend a lot of time traversing the map to get from one location to the next to get to the next minigame/event, which sounds fine but after awhile, becomes very tedious. You end up spending less time playing the games and most of the time traveling, which in my opinion is a waste of time. On top of this, the visuals are very average by today's standards; there is significant pixelation and character models are not impressive at all.All in all, I can only give this game 3 stars. Those of you who liked this game should really check out Wii Party or Mario Party which are far superior in entertainment value.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Disappointing at best", "unixReviewTime": 1330387200, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2012"}

Carroll \"cyrus_zuo\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "We've played through nearly 200 Wii games (seriously), and this game fits in the category of some of the most enjoyed multiplayer gaming at our house. I have six children ages 3-12 and they all enjoy playing the game, which is a rare thing only a few other games have accomplished. The best thing is that they can all play together, which when you have a big family like mine is a great thing.The amount of content in Go Vacation is amazing. There are 4 different areas, Beach, Mountain, City, and Snow, each of which feels like a complete game itself with a variety of things to do. The kids have piled up over 20 hours in just a few weeks (we closely monitor playtime, so 20 hours in that period of time means they've spent essentially 100% of their game time playing it). They are still going strong and I expect they will be for weeks to come. There is a ton to do, and with the added customizations to your villa, hidden things to find, and outfits to change between, the entertainment value for the cost of the game is Fantastic!The games themselves I personally find are hit and miss, though notably the kids love them. I find that they are better than most other 3rd party games. For example, I think the controls are much better than just about anything in the Sonic & Mario at the Olympics series (which perhaps oddly seems like the most comparable game I can think of).The one minus point (4/5 stars) comes from my personal take. I've played the game a bit and find the frame rate drops below levels I enjoy when we play 4 people at once (the game is mostly split screen). That drop in frame rate can make the game a bit nauseating for me at times. As well the controls are not up to the level of Nintendo's first party offerings like Wii Sports Resort. So as a game for me, it's in the good category, but not quite up to 'great' status. The kids would give it 5 stars I'm certain!Overall it is a really fun game that is perfect for a wintry day of video game fun. If you have a family with kids I STRONGLY recommend it!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Rare game the family loves", "unixReviewTime": 1323648000, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2011"}

It's been great fun, and so I thought I would add to the mix of games by trying out Pac-Man Party.This game is a weird mix between Monopoly and Mario Party. The currency in \"Pac-Man Party\" is cookies, and you earn cookies by moving around the game board and claiming bits of land and building castles on that land with your colors. Like Monopoly, each time you make a lap around the game board, you earn more cookies, except in \"Oac-Man Party\", your cookie value goes up based on how many castles you own. When you land on someone else's castle, you battle them for ownership by playing a mini-game. The other players compete as well, but they play for bonus cookies.I have to admit, it took us a few laps around the board before we figured out what we were doing or what the game was about, but it was still great fun. The mini-games are easy to pick up, and vary enough so that different players will find different games they excel at and everyone gets a chance at winning. (beware: no practice mode on any of the mini-games, so the first time playing is sort of confusing as you figure it out.)For the price, this is a *GREAT* game. It's colorful and relatively easy to pick up. It's perfect for families, parties, or young children. I will say that I can't imagine two 12-year-olds sitting down with this game and doing serious battle- it's very lighthearted.If you love Wii Party and Mario Party and are looking for another Wii \"board game\" to add to your collection, you'll love this.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "GREAT value - lots of fun for families", "unixReviewTime": 1333843200, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2012"}

The gameplay is practically EXACTLY the same, and a lot of the minigames look like they were lifted directly from Mario Party 8 and given Pac-Man characters.For starters, the characters look NOTHING like their classical selves...at least the Mario characters bear SOME resemblance to their 8-bit counterparts!! For one thing, Pac-Man has legs and arms...uhhh....and all of the ghosts have weird hairstyles and they range from fat to impossibly skinny.Some of the courses bear a lot of resemblance to the Mario Party courses, such as the haunted course in this game being almost exactly the same as Boo's Mansion in Mario Party 8. Even a lot of the minigames are lifted directly from Mario Party 8 and given a Pac-Man twist. One example is the one where you have to shake the soda bottle as hard as you can to see how high up you fly. This is an exact ripoff of the one in Mario Party 8 where you shake the soda CAN to see how high the soda blasts up. R-I-P-O-F-F. Each round also starts with a \"miniminigame\" to decide how many spots you move during that round and overall these games are very tedious and kind of a waste of time. Each course also has a \"boss\" so to speak and they appear after you pass a certain spot a certain number of times. These \"bosses\" have nothing to do with the main adventure at all and ultimately seem like a waste of time - the battles last almost 5 minutes for practically no reward. Oh and the time it takes to play one board is around 60-90 minutes whereas in a Mario Party game one board takes 30-45 minutes. 60-90 minutes per board is way too long.The graphics for this game are okay...they're not all that great but I've seen worse. We recently upgraded to the Wii U, and typically Wii games look slightly upscaled in quality when played on the Wii U but SOMEHOW this game manages to look WORSE when played on the Wii U. The music is really cheap and mostly comprises of a 10- to 15-second loop repeating over and over again, getting really annoying. There is only one song for minigames and you won't believe how annoying it got.All in all, Pac-Man Party is a more confusing, more boring, and a cheap knockoff of Mario Party 8.

So I must sadly state that Pac-Man Party does not represent ol' munchmouth at his best.  Now, to be fair I've only played the single player game so I'm admititly missing out on the party aspect of the game. And the game itself plays fine, some of the minigames being greatly entertaining. But it just doesn't feel like Pac-Man. No chases, no mazes, no power pellets. Pac-Man and the ghosts are now all chummy-chummy, pac dots have been renamed \"cookies\" (!?) and don't even get me started on the ghosts new looks. I don't know if the upcoming Ghostly Adventures TV show is to blame or if this game inspired the look of the show, but either way the lovable ghost monsters Pac's been eating and being eaten by for decades have never looked doofier. Inky and Blinkie have idiot hair-do's, Clyde's now sporting an xx-large ghost sheet (no wonder he's \"pokey\"!) and poor Pinky looks like a demented bobble head!

In this mode you will go through the entire Dragon Ball Z story from the arrival of Goku's brother Raditz to the defeat of Majin Buu. You will spend plenty of time in the over-world map guiding your fighter to certain destinations and encountering various foes. Despite it's similarities to Shin Budokai Another World's over-world map, Tenkaichi Tag Team manages to make it bearable enough and even sometimes fun. Who doesn't like to see their favorite Dragon Ball Z characters brought down to size with huge bobble heads? A frequent problem with Another Road was repetition. You would have to battle the same enemy numerous times consecutively, even if he isn't your primary target. This can grow tiresome even to the most die-hard Dragon Ball Z fan. This is still an issue in Tenkaichi Tag, and sometimes it's downright horrendous. Enemies are spaced out much further and are easier to avoid. It's really rather simple to make your way straight to your primary target without worrying about bumping into a random enemy and wasting time on a needless fight. The developers decided to be nice this time and give you a chance to avoid a random battle even if an enemy is right on your tail. For example, if you are using Goku, you can press the square button to use Solar Flare to temporarily blind any nearby enemies. You can then make your escape.However, for those of you looking to obtain every unlockable item, you should probably reconsider playing the story mode, and opt to download the sav file instead. That is, of course, unless you feel you're up to the repetitiveness that Dragon Walker will offer. To unlock just one item, sometimes you will have to complete various objectives. Everything from full-filling a task for a non-playable character, facing a special adversary, to defeating each and every enemy on the map. Artificial longevity is what I would call this. It isn't fun and can prove to be downright frustrating. Not because it's too hard, not at all. If anything Dragon Walker is too easy. What's frustrating is that there are so many sets of enemies, so not only will completing this one task take a while, sometimes you may not be able to complete it at all. That's because the enemies are spaced out too far, and some even navigate the map which makes them harder to find. I can count at least two occurrences where I thought I had defeated every enemy, only to find out after finishing the chapter that I missed one despite spending 10 -15 minutes scouring the map in search of any others.Despite it's short-comings, Dragon Walker is an ok re-telling of the classic Dragon Ball Z tale for the die-hard fan who already knows the story, but less than stellar for anyone who may not be familiar with Dragon Ball. The story-telling is choppy for one and don't be surprised if you find a typo or two.In Tenkaichi Tag Team's Free Battle mode you can choose to relive classic fights from the series or create your own.Want Future Trunks to duke it out with his kid self from the Buu arc? You can do that and pretty much any other fight you can imagine. The action is identical to that of previous installments in the Tenkaichi series (that's right, all the biggest and baddest moves from Tenkaichi 3 are still here) with some control revisions due to the PSP's lack of secondary shoulder buttons and dual analog nubs. It's mostly the same so Tenkaichi veterans shouldn't take too long to become accustomed to the new control configurations. New-comers will find the controls comfortable and easy to learn. You can also make use of the training mode to get the hang of the game's unusual third person perspective and to develop your skills for use against the CPU or friends in the Multiplayer mode.Now to what the game is all about, two on two matches. Playing two on two on the hardest difficulty can prove to be a frantic and fast paced experience. It is the game's primary gimmick and for the most part, it delivers it well. The fights are fun but can be problematic at times. Sometimes when you're concentrating on one thing, your enemy's ally will blast you from out of nowhere, but that can be forgiven since it isn't that much of a detriment to the overall two-on-two experience. It's always fun to pair unlikely allies together and see what snide comments they make prior to a match's commencement. Things get rough in the last portions of Battle 100 though. On the last stages of the final group of battles, you pick a team of two characters to battle the computer controlled teams. The frustrating thing about this is that both teammates of the opposing team will primarily focus on you, the player, while mostly ignoring your partner. So instead of 'tag', these will be more like handicap matches. If that isn't enough, their attack and defensive abilities are so high, that you will be near death within seconds if you're not careful.Sound: DBZ Tenkaichi Tag Team is full of awesome sound effects that give that extra oomph to your matches. The background music is mostly generic with only a couple of standout themes. The voice overs are great as always, though there are some notable voice changes. Stephanie Nadolny (Gohan) and Linda Young (Freeza) have been replaced by the folks who voice these characters for Dragon Ball Z Kai. Although I prefer Linda and Stephanie Nadolny, these new voice actors certainly voiced their parts well.Graphics: The graphics are definitely a step down from the console versions, though that's to be expected. The venues and character models can at times look blurry but that's hardly a deterrent considering the game has great game-play and replayability.Pros:Decent Story Mode: Not perfect and downright ridiculous at times but it gets the job doneOver 70 Characters to choose from (counting transformed states). For example, Goku (Super Saiyan 1) and Goku (Super Saiyan 3) both count as separate characters.Deeper In-game transformations. You can choose Goku's base form then transform into Super Saiyan, and then to Super Saiyan 2 and 3. You can also transform into Super Saiyan 2 or 3 straight from base form by using the analog nub while pressing the select button. You can also undo a transformation. For example, if you're in Super Saiyan 2 mode, you can quickly return to base mode by pressing Down + Select.Great Fighting Mechanics: If you loved the Tenkaichi series on the Playstation 2 and on the Wii, you will love it here. Tenkaichi Tag Team is identical in nearly every way with the only major difference being it's portability.Cons:Difficulty: The only thing that prevents this game from surpassing or being as good as previous installments in the Tenkaichi franchise is the game's difficulty. It is far too easy. While it is suspected that the general difficulty may have been decreased to accommodate the new two on two feature, it leaves the one on one experience lacking in excitement. To ramp up the difficulty you should consider using default characters against fully customized characters. Give yourself 2 senzus and give the CPU 4 senzu beans. It's cheap but it sure beats playing against the regular AI.Repetitiveness: Having to kill 10 sets of the same enemies on one map, really?Despite these flaws, I highly recommend this game to all Dragon Ball Z fanatics. It is very well worth the $39.99 price tag. After all, it is a portable version of Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 with two on two features, what more could you possibly want? Except for a harder difficulty of course. :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Tag Team Review", "unixReviewTime": 1287705600, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2010"}

I've played the PS2 games, and this version on the PSP has simpler controls than the PS2 versions I played, which is very nice.  The way you pull off moves from character to character are fairly identical, so once you've got one character down the rest are easy to learn.If you're familiar to the Dragon Ball Z story, then there's nothing new here, and you may get bored with the story telling.  If you're not familiar with Dragon Ball Z, then it does fairly adequate in the storytelling, but you may get lost in spots.The game play is what I like the most. The fights are fast and flashy, which is why I'm a fan dragon ball Z anyway.  The addition of 2v2 really adds to the excitement. Its fun to be fighting one guy and see your team mate blasting an energy wave at another guy in the distance. And rushing to the aid of your teammate, or visa versa.The other two PSP DBZ fighting games were ok, but the limited in game transformations were very disappointing. In dragon ball z tenkaichi tag team they allow you to transform into all the forms in-game, and even power down from them, which is a big winner for me on the PSP.As a fan of dragon ball z tenkaichi games, this review is a bit biased. If you're not a fan of the dragon ball z tenkaichi series, then you may not enjoy this game as much as i do.

The only things I dislike, in regards to the way it feels, are the shoulder buttons.-Connecting to the receiver is easy and instant, and the controller turns itself off after a period of inactivity to save battery power, so you don't have to worry about it.-Three AAA batteries last for quite a while.The NOT SO GREAT:-The shoulder buttons are very sticky out-of-package, but a quick dissection to add some 3-in-1 oil to the sliders fixes this issue. The shoulder buttons still feel awful in comparison to the original GC, but they do not stick, and that's all that matters.-The controller is apparently very cheaply manufactured; when I opened one of them to oil the shoulder button sliders, I was very careful with the wiring and one of the battery compartment wires still came undone. It turns out that the wiring was hardly soldered on at all and I had to re-solder it myself.The AWFUL:-I ordered two of these, and planned to order more, but I will no longer be doing so because when more than one is in use, they interfere with each other and the controllers' communication with the receivers cuts out as they try to reconnect. It is a frequent, although not constant, issue that is simply unacceptable when playing competitive games such as Mario Kart and Smash Brothers. Even placing the receivers in the first and fourth slots, so that they are as far away as possible, slightly improves but does not prevent the issue.I have mixed feelings about recommending these controllers. If you only need one, buy it, hands down. If you want more than one, be prepared to run into occasional, but not completely crippling, issues. I can only speculate that using more than two at a time will result it horrendous interference. I will still give 4 stars because, although the interference is very distressing, I still love the controller and, as always, there are a couple of terrible reviews from people who are \"logically impaired\" and/or entirely too critical.P.S. Amazon goofed and I cannot change the \"fun\" rating from 5 stars to 4 stars, but let it be known that the \"fun\" factor is slightly diminished after encountering the interference issue.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good buy, BUT", "unixReviewTime": 1324166400, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2011"}

I prefer this type of HOG where you actually do something with some of the objects you collect. The mini puzzles are pretty interesting and not impossible to figure out and solve. A puzzle involving stained glass patterns is unique and there's a slide puzzle with striking graphics involving masks.Again there is more of a creep than a scare factor to this game.

The puzzles themselves are pretty easy once you find the missing item if they need one; you can also skip them. The fatal flaw with this game, IMO, is that there are only hints in the hidden object rooms--there is no way for me to get a hint on where I am to go from here, and 15 minutes of trying to continue game play is about it for me!

Multiple weapons are available in a first person perspective to combat a variety of mutated creatures, soldiers, and bad guys.  The game ran without a stutter, on a dual core Centrino + Nvidia GS9800M video.  The graphics, all on, were detailed enough.  There was plenty to enjoy, including moving back and forth through two time periods, the variety of weapons, and the overall difficulty during combat.  Puzzles, mostly easily resolved, added to the fun.  Combat took some effort in a couple of sequences to discover new strategies with the weapons available.  Once you have your \"TMD\" weapon things start to get much more interesting.  Depending on how you use it, time can be controlled, items aged or rejunenated, melee skills increase, time bubbles created, and rifts opened.  TMD effects on living things varied, sometimes causing aging or mutation.  All of this took a little getting used to with standard keyboard control, but is mostly intuitive.  It is a short play, consuming a couple of hours, and once you see the four alternative endings it is done.On the positive side?  A nice variety of weapons with different abilities and capabilities.  The usual combat rifle and shotgun, along with a rail gun, machine cannon, time slowing sniper, pistol, and grenade launcher.  A rocket launcher, and a rifle that provided ammo that you could guide in slow motion added to the arsenal.  The TMD made for a great concept weapon, and near the end you find yourself enjoying its capabilities more and more.  Shooting a time bubble was certainly a very enjoyable aspect of the TMD, allowing a pseudo shield or to stop things in their tracks.  Graphics, especially in certain kills, were pretty cool.  Much of these ideas have been used in many other games, but some just never get old.  Battles were challenging; and one was epic with unusual movements adding to an illusion of being high above on a collapsing rail bridge.  I liked a number of sequences where time was important, whether it was saving your ally or running out of air.The things that were less enjoyable?  The reward curve could have been enhanced earlier in the game with more E99 (currency) and weapon tech boxes to upgrade abilities and weapons.  As it was, things really did not get super interesting until 3/4 of the way through the game, and then the game is over.  A larger backpack for carrying 3-4 weapons would have been nice.  Holding at 2 weapons, and then being required to either find weapons to pick up, or switching at a weapons locker was inconvenient -- especially when much of the fun was seeing what each gun would do.  The weapons locker itself did not carry the rocket launcher or the guided ammo rifle, and you were forced to find these weapons as you could, then you could not hold on to them.  As soon as you switched away from them, you carried your original two choices.  On the first major boss battle, I was reminded too much of Doom, with the periodic laughing from the boss taking me back to Doom 3....but also annoying me (maybe I was just annoyed it took me a while to figure out what to do!).  There was little sandbox quality to this game.  You could not fall off of ledges, jump just anywhere (even if it looked like you could) or do much outside of the line you were supposed to follow.Worth full retail price?  Nah.

MacMahon", "helpful": [16, 17], "reviewText": "This review might read a little strange because I am going to list a lot of things wrong with the game, then tell you to buy it anyway.  The long and short of it is that Raven Software, a group of developers who have been making FPS games for almost two decades, really liked Bioshock.  A lot.While Raven's previous titles from recent years were very old-school, Quake 4 even still having floating weapon pick-ups, Singularity plays much more like a modern console FPS game.  Singularity is slow-paced, has various sections that concentrate more on light puzzle-solving than shooting and even long stretches just added for atmosphere.  Speaking of atmosphere, the game has it in spades... great environments, cool effects, audio and written logs, films, music, the works.  The game uses the Unreal Engine 3 as well, though it has brighter colors and more vibrant environments than many games that use the same engine.  Does it sound like Bioshock yet?  Okay, how about this: you get special powers that you upgrade and add new abilities to by spending an in-game currency.  Warm yet?  How about: the game is mostly linear, but has some side paths you can travel for more pick-ups.What I am driving home here is that Raven might as well of called this Bioshock 3.  The UE3 engine, the vibrant colors, the pick-ups, the powers, the slower pace, the light puzzles... everything is influenced by Irrational Games' underwater masterpiece.  This makes it a very easy game to review though, because basically if you want another Bioshock then get this game.  It is polished and does the Bioshock style well, and the storyline and location... a Russian experimental weapons base you visit long after a disaster of epic proportions, ruined, dark and wet just like Bioshock's Rapture... are well presented.The negatives of the game lie mostly in the port to PC.  Though Raven were a PC-focused developer all the way through Quake 4 a few years ago, Wolfenstein and now Singularity are both console ports.  The FOV is limited, making you feel a bit claustrophobic, and the interface and control methods are all designed with consoles first in mind.  One particular annoyance is that the \"use\" command and the \"reload\" command are both tied to the same key, meaning if you have a preferred command setup something is likely not going to be where you want, and of course hitting \"use\" off-target will reload your weapon when you don't want to.  Instead of using a different key for each power like a PC game would the game puts all your powers on a few inputs, making you press a key for one thing, hold it for another, or similar things.  There is even an auto-aim option in the menu that is on by default!None of those console port issues are game-breaking by any means, just minor annoyances, but the console port nature of this title DOES ruin the multiplayer.  No text chat, no dedicated servers and a low player count... what is there might be decent, but with actual PC multiplayer games on the market why would you play it?  The answer is: you won't.And yet despite all the stolen inspiration, despite all the console port issues, despite the useless multiplayer, I am going to give this game a 4 out of 5.  Why?  Simply because it is a very fun and impressive looking shooter!  That is what you would buy the game for I assume, and that is what Singularity is.  At high resolutions and with AA forced through your video card's control panel the game looks very, very good, and the mouse control is smooth and polished.  The action is very well done, the guns feel and work great, the powers are fun, the difficulty is just right...

I hope they fix all the problems for number 2If you like Bioshock, Wolfenstine or any game like that, you will love this game.And like those games you upgrade weapons and powers to make you super powerful and making the game pretty darn easy by the end.A few problems though, it is way to short, but it didn't feel to repetitive because of it.The levels felt very boxed in and very linear with so many invisible walls, although it appears when looking around these beautiful levels, as if you could walk, run and jump all over the place, you can not. It's got an old school feel and that's ok with me.The guns feel crappy, lite and flimsy, I want weight to my guns, and unique sounds, these have your generic reload and shoot sounds.Now don't get me wrong, the guns are cool, like the seeker, if you have played it, you know what I mean. Or that grenade gun thing with the balls, it's awesome .Your TMD (time manipulation device) in the game feels like plasmids, but that's ok, because it works very well.And speaking of the TMD you can't use it on everything, (which is weird) only things that light up your TMD crosshair.There are \"lite\" puzzles, they're really not hard to figure out, as a game becomes more difficult so should the puzzles in that game, this is not like that in this game at all.It's like they took all the best Sci-Fi survival horror games and took a bunch of the best parts and gimmicks, rolled them all together and made a burritos out of it. It's a delicious game. All the negatives can be over looked, by how much fun you will have playing it.I'm on my second playthrough now on hard and I think it's more fun that way too.Oh and it sucks no one is online for multiplayer......... how am I suppose to get those trophies when no one is online?", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "4 stars because I want a good sequel", "unixReviewTime": 1279584000, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2010"}

However does it stand strong or did the \"singularity\" devour the gameplay as well as time itself?Gameplay: As I mentioned earlier,  Singularity has a nice old school feel to it at times.  It reminded me when shooters were just simply shooters. Run through a level fighting enemies, not overloading you with graphic awe.  I attempted Singularity on \"HARD\" and was actually a little disappointed by this.  Hard really wasn't hard.  It felt like \"easy\" w/ enemies that did ungodly amount of damage to you. It did make me use strategy though instead of hulking through areas like I have super armor or something.  The gameplay mechanics are a nice blend of well polished FPS mechanics, with a very nifty time manipulation element that lets you influence certain objects in  your environment(E99 infused stuff) and then pulls various mechanics from other games.  The \"chrono-step\" is my favorite. Similar to Dead Space's objective tracking system, but this looks into the future to find out where you are going to goSound/Story:  Very creative storyline that has multiple endings (3 to be exact).  The game keeps you guessing as to who is the good guy and who is the bad guy.  Hidden messages in time, mysterious warnings, the more time changes the more confusing things get.  Essentially you are a US soldier sent to an Island outside of Russia to investigate a radiation burst.  Next thing you know, time changed and things have gone to hell; you must embark on your quest to try and repair time.  Sound is really good.  The weapons sound crisp and clean, with the voice overs being decent.** This game lacks Subtitles,  which is a bit of a downer especially for the hearing-impaired or someone like me who just enjoys having em on **Graphics/Presentation: Graphics are very good, not ground breaking or jaw-dropping but they are crisp and do a good job setting a creepy environment.  I was actually more impressed with enemy animations.  Very realistic.  It was nice to shoot an enemy and it wasn't an insta-kill shot , you can see them on the floor trying to crawl away or get back up. I had a rare time where an enemy even faked it on me and shot me from behind.**Presentation is where this game honestly loses a star and why I am going into a little detail with it.  The game is short, but falls in line with the 'norm' these days it seems. On HARD I beat it in about 7hrs  which means on Easy  it probably is a 4-5hr play through.  Check points save your progress but once in a while they seem spaced fairly far apart.  While the puzzles and gameplay were lots of fun, the game starts to rely heavily on the same puzzle but not to the point where it makes the game annoying.  As the game starts to approach the end it just feels squished together.  The pacing is off and I started to find myself rushing through areas simply to get to more action  --- In other words  the game probably could of used just a tiny bit more polishing towards the last hour of gameplayLength/Replay: As said above, the game is about 4-5hrs on easy,  7ish on Hard.  3 different endings  make for good replay value however, if you simply select \"continue\" after you beat the game you can literally Re-beat the game and get a different ending thus taking away the replay value of the campaign(I still will play through it again though, try to find stuff I missed)  The game has Multi-player included but it really doesn't hold up well compared to other MP shooter gamesOverall Score: 83%Singularity is a fun game.  Worth a $60 purchase, ehhh probably not.  However $30 would be a great deal for the game.  It has a very polished shooting element with a decent storyline.  The game is a lot of fun and it is nice to be able to use the power of TIME itself to influence your enemies and environment.  What really held this game back was a lack of polish to the pacing and constant recycling of the same puzzle element; plus a very generic, almost pointless tacked on MP(that has almost the same number of achievements/trophies than the game itself?!)  Still, Singularity is definitely worth adding to your collection.  It is one of those games that you can return to after a few months and have just as much fun as when you first got it** Seeker Rifle should be mandatory for all future FPS games ****Bonus: The included Graphic Novel.  Honestly, don't pay extra just to get the novel.  The novel itself is well put together and uses color images but really doesn't add much to the game.  It essentially details the discovering of E99 in 1940.  Really serves no purpose since the discovery of E99 isn't a shocking revelation as the game tells you this 10minutes in.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The great shooter that could have been...", "unixReviewTime": 1291161600, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2010"}

Another writer compared it to the plasmids of Bioshock and that sums it up pretty well.  If you just run and shoot, you will get through the game pretty quickly, but if you like to take your time and explore, like I do, you can stretch it out to 8-9 hours.  You could almost call Singularity a poor man's Bioshock and by saying that if you liked Bioshock, you will like Singularity.  Their multiplayer has really gotten some poor ratings, but the problem is not with the gameplay, but the sorry servers.  It's like Raven didn't really think that too many people were going to play online so they shortchanged us on the servers.  The multiplayer games are really very fun, to me, if you can get in a game.  Each game consists of two rounds.  You get to play as soldiers and as the monsters which is very cool.

At first I was hesitant to purchase Singularity, but I'm glad I did!The gameplay is your standard FPS fare, nothing new or boundary pushing in Singularity.  The story is interesting, I like the sci-fi elements.  There are too many \"war\" FPS games out there so Singularity fills the void nicely.Over the course of the game, you receive a Time Manipulation Device, or TMD.  As you play, your TMD is upgraded with powers such as slowing down time, reverting enemies into creatures that go on a rampage, picking up and throwing objects around the environment, and using TMD power as a thruster to knock back and harm enemies and objects.I like the variety of enemies in this game.  You have Russian troops coming after you as well as different types of mutated humans as a result of the explosion and E99.  Enemies use a variety of weapons and the mutants can throw exploding barrels at you.The graphics in the game are average, similar to the \"war\" type FPS games where objects and textures appear somewhat blurry/pixelated when you stand next to them.  It's nothing serious and it didn't affect my enjoyment of the game at all.There are a number of different weapons, your standard rifle and shotgun, pistol, grenade launcher (with a remote controlled rolling bomb secondary attack), sniper rifle, and more, I don't want to give away everything.  Each weapon's clip capacity, reload speed, and damage can be upgraded twice using weapon kits you find in various places around the levels.  First level upgrades require one kit, 2nd require 2.Scattered everywhere in the game is E99, an element used in everything in this alternate reality.  You collect various containers of it and it's used as a currency to purchase different upgrades such as carrying more health packs, using health faster, longer sprint, more oxygen for swimming, extra weapon precision, and what not.  These different upgrades must be found on blueprints around the levels.  They are generally easy to spot but there are a few that you may pass by.Overall Singularity is an extremely underrated game.  I'm sad that it hasn't sold more copies because Raven is a good developer.  I thought that by sharing my opinions of the game, I can sway people to check it out.  I've put about 8 hours into the game and I'm not finished yet.  I still have another chapter and a half or so.

I've played other shooters and this is one of my favorites.The story sets in Katorga 12, an island where you'll be playing in the present and past fighting soldiers and monsters, where scientifics have been messing up with E99, an element with special properties that has lead to experiments and the later fall of the island. I must say, though, that for me it's not the story what got me hooked, it's all the weapons, all the things you can do with your TMD and how well implemented all the mechanics are. All the level design, what's happening and what comes next is just very well planned and comes smoothly in a solid game.In some games we find attempts for really bright ideas, but the implementation brings it down to a nice try. That, in my opinion, is not the case for Singularity. It is true that it uses some previous ideas, as I find it pretty similar to Bioshock at some points (like the flashback scenes, the \"telekinesis\" thing that we saw in Bioshock, the Pulse) but, as I said, it implements them pretty well and in creative ways. It also adds more stuff to it, as you'll have this device (the TMD) that will be able to make a lot of things like making a slow-motion-bubble where everything inside or touching it will almost not move; reverting soldiers which basically turns the soldiers into puking monsters (doesn't it sound cool?); aging or return to the past some objects & bad guys, which will be basic at some points in the game; and the ones mentioned before.The weapons are a blast aswell, it has the standard ones like revolver, shotgun, machine gun, sniper & gatling-like gun. Along with those it hase some pretty original ones that put that cherry on top, like the Seeker. It's a powerful rifle that will get rid of the enemies in one shot, but the coolest thing is that you drive the bullet. You move it in the direction you want with the right stick from a view behind the bullet, by the time everything is slowed down and you watch the soldiers being eliminated when you hit them. So you just get cover and have some fun. The other one is the Desthex Launcher, which lets you drop a round grenade to the floor which you can control, so you don't even have to see your enemies, you just roll that metroid-like ball over the floor until you hear the soldiers scream \"granada\" and release the button for a sweet elimination!The graphics are very well done. Of course it has some blurry textures here and there (which game doesn't?) but overall it has a neat look with a lot of details, in that post-apocalyptic fashion some games use nowadays. When the game looks specially good is in the rainy scenes because with the Unreal Engine they got a cool effect that looks like the water is running down from the objects, and of course, because of the light reflection the wet scenes look better than others.Last but not least, the multiplayer is awesome!! It only has two modes, but it doesn't need more. The first one is Extermination where you have two teams, one is the soldiers and the other is the monsters. The monsters defend the current base while soldiers try to get to it. This will be harder or easier according to the team's abilities and coordination. The monsters don't have weapons but you can choose from 4 flavors, each having their special abilities: the Zek (basically melee attackers who can turn \"invisible\"), the Reverts (slow ones that puke and throw mines), the ticks (small bugs that can walk on walls and control humans by jumping on their faces), and the radions (big armored spiders that shoot some sort of lasers). There are also 4 types of soldiers, with different abilities: healing, teletransporting, pulsing (throwing enemies back and hurting them) and shielding. Overall it is pretty fun and entertaining, very well thought and executed. The other mode is Soldiers vs. Monsters, which I haven't played yet but I find the name pretty self-explanatory.Oh yes, and the comic book that comes with this edition is pretty cool, good quality & drawings. haven't read it all yet but it's good.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the best shooters I've played", "unixReviewTime": 1296691200, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2011"}

I am not much into the kind of zombie FPS games they have out there but this one had that twist. The ability to manipulate time etc. It turned out to be a great game to me. I enjoyed the plot even though near the end it kinda got a bit confusing as well as I didn't like what you had to do (if you played the game to the end you know what im talking about) kinda makes it seem like there wont be a way for a sequel but maybe.It was a generic shooter until you got the time device. The game creators kinda wrote themselves into a corner with only being able to manipulate things that have been hit by that type of radiation or whatever. However, they probably did it on purpose so that way they wouldn't have had to make it so you could manipulate EVERYTHING cause then that would mean making everything age etc which means more work and they probably didn't want to do that. I was slightly bumbed there wasn't as much going on like more people around in certain parts but that also would have required more work. The weapons such as the guns are generic kinds but once you start getting upgrades to your time device it become much more fun ie the time bubble. It was a bit challenging at times though a lot of fun. I enjoyed the plot and going back and forth through time.One thing that got me a bit annoyed was they should have forgotten about multiplayer (which was boring anyways) and spent that time polishing the game more it could have been even better I feel. Just concentrating on a single player game could have allowed them to make it longer or make it more interactive or even just cleaning up the area a bit more making it look better. That is kinda why I went down a star cause they wasted their time on multiplayer instead of making single player even better. I enjoyed the game so much I already want a sequel but it seems like the company wont make one cause of its poor sales. I really don't see why this game didn't sell well.

(the sniper rifle uses this)- shoot-the-weak-glowing-point boss battles of dozens of modern shooters, such as Lost Planet- recycled bogeyman enemy (the russians are gonna get ya...oooohhhhh i'm so scared)...- a moral choice at the end that doesn't really affect anything...lotta games doing this now...Does this game have anything original whatsoever? Not that I could tell.CONS:- delayed or non texture loading- jaggies, jaggies, jaggies- many ugly muddy textures- some slightly annoying checkpoints (will bother you on Hard)- this game is difficult on Hard and many upgrades you only get toward the very very end of the game. wtf is the point of that?- the game is too hard (on Hard) in the beginning and a breeze at the end...i would think there should be a better balance (it gets harder as it goes, but the upgrades help you keep up)...overall, the game is a 2.5/5 for me...", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "greatest hits of other games...derivative...", "unixReviewTime": 1279756800, "reviewTime": "07 22, 2010"}
{"reviewerID": "A1AISPOIIHTHXX", "asin": "B003M2V2KA", "reviewerName": "Cloud \"...\"", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "Ever play a game, watch a movie or listen to a song that was pretty enjoyable the first experience yet it feels slightly forgettable afterwards? That's kind of what Singularity feels like: a game that has the makings of a good shooter but there's nothing that really stands out in it, whether it's the story, the shooting, the characters or the concept, it feels like it's been done before and probably better. The vibe that will immediately hit you is a kind of Bioshock or even Half-Life 2 where it's not so much about high-octane shooting such as a Call of Duty or Killzone title would have but rather it's more about exploration with the occasional big gunfight. It's not so much that Singularity is outright bad and a waste of money but rather it feels like the experience of it doesn't equal the full asking price and the multiplayer feels half-baked (not tacked on, just...unfinished) so it's a solid rental but anything more feels like you're missing something.Story: On the island of Katorga-12 back in 1955, experiments had been taking place involving \"Element 99\" and its usage in time though a huge explosion, dubbed a \"singularity\", resulted in the destruction of the facility. Back in 2010, you play as Renko, Black Ops soldier sent in to investigate strange radiation emissions when your helicopter is brought down. As you travel through the island, you uncover more details about what happened to the island, a device known as the \"TMD\" and the strange creatures that have been sighted.Graphics: The game looks...decent, yeah, I think that's the best way to describe it. It doesn't really excel in the graphics but it doesn't look bad either. The gore is nicely handled, the different usages of time whether it's your powers, using the TMD to restore bridges, trains and whatnot look cool and creature designs look alright but it's slightly generic too. For a game reportedly 4 years in development, it's strange how better other games look made in half the time.Sound/Music: Sound-wise the game is really great at immersing you in the environment as running through a decaying and abandoned (or is it? dun dun dun) facility really makes you feel like the game is going for atmosphere than out and out loudness on your ears. Voice acting is, well it's okay and perennial favorite Nolan North returns but NOT as the main character, you know, because silent protagonists are better but everyone either has questionable Russian accents or a babe with a good British accent so not much to choose from.Gameplay: If you've played games like the Darkness, or Bioshock and Half-Life 2 then Singularity's tone will be similar. Well there's more bigger setpieces, it's not like the larger, epic firefights one after another that are found in other shooters. It's going for exploration, audio logs, finding hidden messages and exploring a lonely place with the occasional enemy encounter until a bigger encounter later on. There's the occasional puzzle to solve and they're generally pretty easy though on occasion I felt some were slightly vague and I'd be wondering after a few minutes like \"wait, how do you?...oh, nevermind\" and the puzzles never feel like big brain benders that you have to think about but most of the time you just sort of stumble across the answer.The main mechanic found in the game is the TMD, or Time Manipulation Device, as with it, you can do various things to influence the environment or the enemies themselves. Examples like sending out a shockwave which replaces your knife melee is cool, as well as restoring old item boxes to life (probably the most overused one) but my favorite is the time bubble. Holding the right stick and firing it will have a bubble show up and anything inside it will be slowed down temporarily. This can act like crowd control so you can halt one group while you work on another but my favorite use was grabbing exploding barrels a la HL2's Gravity Gun and firing it inside the bubble. It doesn't quite detonate yet so you shoot other enemies only for the bubble to dissipate, the barrel explodes and everything inside it goes boom. Quite neat.The weapons are kind of stock such as an assault rifle, shotgun, magnum and minigun though there is a couple of cool ones. The sniper rifle has a Far Eye-esque function (from Resistance games) where you can slow down time to get the perfect headshot, the Spikeshot acts like the Torque Bow from Gears of War, one weapon has you controlling the bullet in what made me recall Heavenly Sword's aftertouch mechanic and there's a weird grenade launcher where you can for lack of a better word \"drive\" the grenade into enemies. You can upgrade them, naturally, for better reload time or bigger clip and you can gain perks such as refilling TMD energy at the same time as ammo or gain more energy with every kill.Then there's the multiplayer which to me instantly reminded me of ones for Fear 2, Timeshift, Wolfenstein, the Riddick games and the like: it's fine, it works but it's nothing special and you can both A) tell the community won't be thriving for awhile, prompting boosting matches and B) you're not going to be playing it that much. It's kind of well-designed but when I mentioned it felt unfinished before, it kind of does. There's only 2 gametypes, a Team Deathmatch and a Capture and Hold type match and what sets it apart from other MP's is you can control soldiers and creatures that have different abilities. One enemy takes over another character's body so it's always nice to make him shoot his own teammate in the face and yes, there is indeed an enemy that pukes and heals team members but there's not a whole lot of maps and really, the whole thing doesn't feel like Raven Software did whatever and called it a multiplayer but it feels like you're not getting all they wanted to offer.Here's my \"Too long, didn't read\" opinion about Singularity: if you never play it, you won't feel like you're missing out on anything as the shooting felt slightly clumsy to me, the story and characters are largely forgettable and the multiplayer felt kind of drab. But if you do play it, you won't feel like you've wasted your time as it has a kind-of enjoyable single player and at least the multiplayer is different to every realistic military shooter online that's out there but this is the game you pick up further down the road or you rent if there's nothing out there to play.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "3.5; Nothing terrible yet nothing special", "unixReviewTime": 1279411200, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2010"}

The sounds are eerie, and the enemies are varied and amusing.  While I haven't beaten the game yet, I have enjoyed the TMD device (the time manipulater thingy) and the other weapons.

{"reviewerID": "A14A2UV4I4VJ76", "asin": "B003M2V2KA", "reviewerName": "Kevin L. Williams \"K Skate\"", "helpful": [5, 8], "reviewText": "If you are reading this review, then I take it you are thinking of purchasing this game because it looks cool, but at the same time, you are kinda iffy about it due to the fact that you probably haven't heard that much about it.  I bought this game today, and have only played up to the point where you aquire the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) in other words the star of the show.  From what I have seen so far (about 30-45 minutes in the game) the game is awesome in my opinion!!  I gave it 4 stars \"SO FAR\" because I like what I see about the game so far.  Within minutes of the game starting, FPS veterans will immediately notice aspects of COD4 and Bioshock.  Although this game is neither of the two by a long shot, but it does try and throw tactical situations at you in the first mission.  I mention Bioshock because of the fact that the game does a good job of placing the player in an enviroment that was very much alive back in the 50s.  The player will experience flashbacks similiar to those you experienced if you played bioshock to give you the visual of what happened in the past.  I think the game uses this instead of actual cutscenes, but I am unsure.  Also, there are audio logs littered througout the enviroment to give you more of an insight as to what is going on similar to those found in Bioshock and also various notes and letters too.  The graphics are really nice, but again nothing you havent seen before in previous FPSs.  The controls, thank heavens are really tight, but the combat could be a lot better, but nothing to complain about.  This brings me to the TMD..the star of the show.  I think this is what seperates Singularity from other FPSs.  The TMD feels a lot like the Plasmids in Bioshock.  You can use this device to control time, the condition of certain objects in the game world....for example..let's say a monster destroyed a switch needed to open a door to proceed foward..well, you can use the device to bring the switch back to its original state so you can use it to gain access through the door.  On the flip side, you can also age the switch to where its broken again so no one else can use it.  I am unsure if you will actually be in that specific situation late on in the game, but you can age objects just as you can bring them to a \"new\" state.  Singularity sort of blends the Cold War with new age technology, so the weapons that I have aquired in the game so far (revolver, shotgun, assult rifle, and sniper rifle) have a sort of futureistic look and feel to them.  The voiceovers are done very well so far and the frame rate seems to be on point as well.  I haven't gotten into the multiplayer aspect of the game as of yet, but Game Informer said that it was pretty sick!  I am sure that the TMD will have plenty of possibilities to bring a diffferent form of strategy in deathmatches though.  Like I said I have only got about 30-45 minutes in the game so far, so this review is based on a sort of \"is it worth 60 bucks\" type a deal..I think it is, but this may not be the game for everyone.  Even though I mentioned Bioshock and COD 4, this game IS NOT either, but does use some of the same bread and butter that made those games great.  The story seems interesting and in my opinion, this can easily become 5 stars by the end of the game just because it brings something just a little bit different.  This review is based on the Xbox 360 version of the game.

Its controls are very tight, and an FPS game is more or less defined by this standard.  It's an interesting game from start to finish despite there being many drawbacks to the game in general.  Most people have complained about the archaic graphics in this game, but I didn't really mind that at all.  The graphics in this game are definitely not breaking any ground - even for a game that came out two years ago it would still look dated - but the action is so well staged it doesn't matter.  The voice acting is absolutely terrible, and the story is as washed up as humanly possible, but who cares.  As long as you get to blast monsters into limbo that should be enough to keep any gamer interested.  However, there are several things about the game that needed some major polish before being released, but in the end, Singularity is a good time.The developers of Singularity understood that the fundamental reason why people play a first person shooter game is to shoot enemies in the face, and you get plenty of opportunity to do that in this game.  There are some great weapons to use throughout the game such as the \"Seeker\" where you can control bullets to go around corners that finally, when they meet their destination, tear the unlucky victim to shreds.  As morbid as this sounds, the violence in Singularity can be very satisfying.  There are lots of slo-mo's, close-ups, and limbs flying around, and it can get pretty chaotic.  To me, that is the sign of a great FPS.  Action needs to be the main focal point, and this game rarely disappoints in that aspect.The sound is great in this game as well.  Some levels have a very high level of detail, and you can hear grunts and screams coming at you from all sides.  It really helps build a tense atmosphere during some of the levels, and because the graphics are pretty average, the sound makes up for it in spades.I've seen comparisons of this game to Bioshock and Half-Life, and those observations are not unwarranted.  The dark atmosphere and 50's vibe are reminiscent of Bioshock, as are the randomly placed voice recorders that you find as you venture through the game.  Hearing the distant and disturbed voices on the recorders is pretty much a straight lift from Bioshock, but it didn't distract me from the story at all.  There is also a gravity gun which is more or less a take from Half-Life.  Not a big deal, but it still shows that the Singularity developers were more interested in action than originality.  Which brings me to my list of complaints.First of all, the AI in Singularity is the worst I have seen in a game in years.  It's really really bad.  There was an instance where a bad guy was standing right in front of me, took a shot at me, stood there, looked at me, turned the other direction, and calmly waited for me to blow his head off.  This kind of thing happens throughout the game.  There is absolutely nothing difficult about this game whatsoever.  Sure the action is great and you get to blow apart the baddies, but after a while you need at least a little bit of challenge.  Another annoying thing about the AI is that the Russians you're about to kill will stand there and scream at you, repeating the same expressions over and over and over again.  If the AI is going to bellow at you and completely blow their cover in order for you to adequately kill them, at LEAST give them more dialogue.When I mentioned before that the violence is satisfying in Singularity, it can also be shabbily detailed and out and out lazy.  For instance, when you shoot an enemy in the left arm, his left arm will fly off.  Stands to reason.  However, his head and his legs will also go catapulting into the air.  If you shoot a guy in the left arm, why would his right leg and head pop off?  I know, I know, this is a silly video game to begin with, but what I'm trying to say is that each time you kill someone, the exact same dying animation will show with each and every kill.  Short on ideas, I say.Another area where the developers really failed was with the time manipulation idea.  This concept is always awesome in theory, but Singularity proves that it's yet another lame attempt at an ancient gimmick.  The only time you get to manipulate time is to turn old boxes and staircases into their former selves, turn new locks into future dust, and occasionally go back in time to shoot a few bad guys for a few minutes before rushing back to the future.  The time travel idea was more of a distraction than an engaging plot point.Something else that was laughable about the game was the all English voice acting.  I realize that this is a game produced by English speaking individuals, but when you have a tribe of Russians who are dedicating their very souls to bringing down the evil Western influences, and speaking English while they do it, it takes a considerable amount of believability and authenticity away from the story.  There is an unintentionally funny scene in the game where you view a Russian propaganda film about the evil of the West being spoken entirely in English.  Err, really?  Why even bother trying to integrate a story when stuff like this is going on?  I would have had more respect for the game if it just glossed over aspects like this and given us a few more hours of blowing stuff up.  It's pointless to add scenes like this when it adds absolutely nothing to the big picture.  This really is the fundamental problem of the game: it can't decide whether it wants tell a story, or just be a kick-a** shooter.  If it had dedicated itself to one or the other it would have been a much stronger experience.The biggest disappointment with this game is its length.  I finished this game in under 7 total hours on my first play through.  While that's not a crime in video game circles, it certainly doesn't warrant a purchase price of 60 dollars.  If ever you were to rent a game, Singularity would be it.There is definitely more wrong with Singularity than there is right.  Raven has been developing this game for over two years, so to see such a mediocre result is genuinely surprising.  I read a few reviews from fellow Amazon customers citing a laundry list of negatives concerning this game, yet still awarding it five stars.  Five stars represents a perfect game.  How can one hand out a five star review to a game that has so many clear flaws?  Singularity has many problems, and any conscientious reviewer would be irresponsible to give it five stars.That doesn't mean Singularity doesn't have great moments as well.  As a weekend rental, I would highly recommend this game.  It has enough tight gameplay, cool weapons, and over the top violence to satiate any fan of the FPS genre.  Just don't expect to still be interested once that weekend is over.  I realize that rating a game for length can be a touchy subject, but I feel that paying 60 dollars for a game that only lasts a few hours is extremely excessive.  Moreover, if you're going to blatantly borrow from games like Bioshock, you better come correct and at least do your best to match one single aspect of the game you're emulating.  Otherwise, you're just another imitator trying to cash in on a somewhat tired idea.What Singularity lacks in originality it makes up for in exuberance and a love for old school game play.

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"", "helpful": [6, 11], "reviewText": "Either you weren't paying attention, or you have never played Bioshock if you don't see the similarities between these two games. And while Singularity is a solid first person shooter, it didn't even touch Bioshock. This is not to say that Singularity doesn't have its own spice it adds to the mix, but really all that the game has going for it is the technology specific to the game (I.E. the ability to age an enemy into dust, hurl them backwards, pick up and throw objects, and use those properties to solve fairly straightforward puzzles). Other than this one thing though, the game really doesn't have anything going for it. Playing the game, I was never really immersed in it because I felt like everything I was seeing had been done before (and better) in previous games (Bioshock, Fallout).Singularity didn't bring much new to the table, and maybe what I really want in a game, more than anything, is a good story. Maybe that's too much to ask for in a shooter, and maybe it's the reason why I am only giving it three stars. But for me, good graphics and a solid shooter experience just doesn't cut it for me. The combat is pretty well done. There are things that could have been better, a cover system for instance, so you don't end up getting shot to hell all the time, but otherwise it's pretty good. I did notice quite a bit of difficulty (I played on Normal) at the beginning of the game, before you acquire the TMD device that allows all of the time/spatial manipulation), and I was afraid the game was just going to be difficult the whole time, but things balanced out pretty well once you get the TMD.The voice acting itself is pretty good, which is always a plus for a game, however, the script isn't very good. Full of action one-liners at the beginning of the game like \"Let's get to the radio tower so we can get out of this circle-jerk.\" Wah wahhhhh. It's not even that big of a deal, but things played out like a soap opera. The characters speak as if they are revealing some plot twist, when the story continues playing out in so clich&eacute;d a way that you know what is going to happen before they say it (or it just happens), so then their dramatization seems very silly.Another thing I am growing tired of is playing a faceless and voiceless character. At the beginning, after your chopper goes down, the squad leader repeatedly asks over the radio if anyone else is out there. To which your character responds nothing. Really? Usually in games where your character has no voice, the persons speaking to you just TELL you things, they don't ask things. So when someone asks repeatedly \"Did anyone else f***ing make it?!\" you expect your character to acknowledge in some way. It was just some of the things that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.Speaking of things not making sense, the back-story in the game, as in, the intro, is told is a quick two minute montage. It runs through the basics of what is going on so fast you kind of feel overwhelmed. And at the end of the game I was left wondering why they bothered giving the game a story at all. They should have just given you all the technology and weapons and let you duke it out across various levels. It would have spared us all the cheesy dialogue and the redundant time-travel plot. So when you get your first breath of what's to come, it's inside a sort of introduction center to new arrivals coming to the island. There are notes strewn about you can read, and even a propaganda film that speaks of how the \"Good, strong, good, heroic, and good\" Russian people must resist the evil western influences. But...the film is narrated IN ENGLISH. Seriously, WAT. Now I then thought that maybe your character speaks Russian, so the game just wants you to assume that you are hearing through the ears of your character, and he is translating for you. But I don't really think so, I think the developers just didn't realize it. It would have been more immersive for the film to be narrated in Russian with English subtitles so you understood what was going on. Same thing with the notes you can read in the game. Half of the notes are written on what I suppose is graph paper, making them really difficult to read sometimes (Eventually I just gave up reading the ones on the graph paper).So the game takes place in 2010, but there are flashbacks to and time traveling back to 1955ish. However, one thing that bothered me was that you can interact with the phones in the present day, but not in the past, when they really would have been working. WAT. Same thing with the typewriters. Why are any of them interactable? When you interact with a typewriter all you hear is a DING sound, and with a phone all you get is a dial tone. Speaking of which, we're to assume that after dozens of huge EMP bursts over the years that there are ANY electronic devices still working? WAT.So I dunno, I'm not a scientist or anything, I just like what I like, and I didn't really like this game. It has its good points. It has good action, interesting and upgradeable weapons, boss battles, weird monsters and a whole lot of killing...but it really didn't bring anything new to the table, and for me that's what was really wrong with it. When you've played enough games (or seen enough Hollywood action movies) that things become clich&eacute;d, you don't want what could have been a really good game to turn out like this. I will probably be in the minority for kind of disliking this game, and straight shooters (plot and annoyances aside) have their niche, but this game just didn't speak to me. Definitely not worth $60. Good thing the pre-order came with a $20 video game rebate.So I guess in summary, if you like things that go boom, and bloody violence all plot and cheesiness aside (and believe me, I can handle some cheese, but not when the game doesn't realize it's being cheesy, that's just sad), then this game might definitely be something that you would like.

Specifically Alan Wake and Bioshock 2 got a royal roasting from me for tedious, repetitive gameplay and very limited direction which your character can explore. So when I began Singularity it was pretty disappointing to see it fell into that same category of game. Now don't get me wrong, occasionally when done right I like a good corridor FPS - Gears of War, Max Payne, Doom 3 and others all dictated to you where you could go but the most important ingredient was that those games were fun!Thankfully Singularity is another one that I loved - it's flipping awesome. The basic premise is you need to find a time-travel device called the TMD which will allow you to jump multiple times between 2010 and 1955 and therefore save the world, or something along those lines. The story is worth mentioning because, without giving anything away, it's utterly brilliant and the ending immediately made me start a new game to see if the events that are recapped in the final scene really did happen. And it's rare that I go through a game twice. Frankly, I might even give this one a third run through - it's that amazing.Gameplay borrows a lot from recent games such as Bioshock with the tape recorders and plasmid-type upgrades and it also reminded me a lot of Half Life 2 in the style of the graphics and some of the enemies you face. The most similar element to Half Life is the TMD which amongst many of its features allows you to grab objects from a distance and throw them at bad guys or to trigger some physics puzzle you'll face. The TMD can also age selected objects which causes them to usually diminish in size to also aid you and generally while these parts are simplistic in nature they are fun to solve. The Bioshock/System Shock tape recordings are also worth mentioning in Singularity because if you start to play one then walk away the sound gets quieter. So what you ask? Well in Bioshock they're played 'in your head' and ruin any tension as the game lowers the main game audio during the massive amounts of tape playback. It's so much nicer to have the sound come from an actual in game object - are you listing Remedy?As the game progresses you dart between 2010 and 1955 at the game's discretion - you cannot do this any anytime you choose sadly. I also felt the difference visually between the two centuries just wasn't radical enough to remind me which time I was in. Soldiers in 1955 seemed to have pretty much the same tech as 2010 and bad guys were also the same regardless. I would've like to have some some game mechanic to distinguish the two eras - even to the point of maybe de-saturating the color of '55 a little or something. But if that's my biggest gripe then we have a winner here folks!The game continues throughout the lengthy campaign to keep things interesting with varied weapons, upgrades, puzzles, new areas (and a lot of great retreading of areas between timelines) and enemies. It constantly entertains even during the few boss battles which I normally loath. And Singularity also balances the metaphorical shades of black and white here too; for example there's one point where you have to pass by some blind enemies who can only detect you if they hear you. Sure you can go in guns blazing (but there's a very good chance you'll die very quickly) or you can choose to tip-toe past them. It was an incredibly tense few minutes slowly walking past these 'reverts' and I haven't been that on edge in a game in very long time. Bravo.I did not play multi-player so can't comment on that but in terms of SP this sleeper should be in your collection right now. The devs should be commended for, ahem, borrowing elements from other successes and radically improving on them resulting in a very, very good game.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Wow - unexpected excellence!", "unixReviewTime": 1280793600, "reviewTime": "08 3, 2010"}

This game, which got surprisingly little press, is actually pretty decent... personally I was expecting a little more after the major delay but hey at least they didn't scrap it.The graphics are nice but nothing spectacular.The sound is better than average... makes for a very creepy atmosphere.The story is pretty solid except for a few tiny plot holes that won't spoil it for you unless you're just that nit picky. There is a twist at the end, that is revealed half an hour into the game and if you don't make the connection as soon as it happens I just don;t know what to say to you.Gameplay mechanics are simple enough you're not going to give yourself a migraine trying to figure out what to do. Though if an enemy is flying towards you and you empty a shotgun into them midflight they will still damage you. And at some points the environment is easy to get caught up on.Honestly my biggest gripe about this game is the lack of character development... it's one thing to play \"you\" in a game, to make the decisions you want to make and act like you. It's another to have a created main character that has \"0\" personality and does not interact with anyone. The character has no dialogue in the game, no choices to make, he's a mute military \"go-for\". It is Dead Space's Isaac Clark all over again... I cannot relate with this character at all because it's like trying to relate to a brick.Replay value for the campaign is pretty low unless you missed out on some achievements/trophies because there is no mission select... you got to start all over from the beginning. You may notice a few little background things you missed in the first run through but nothing that's going to make you wet your pants.I'll admit I did not play the multiplayer... there's some games that can use a multiplayer and others that do not, the time manipulation mechanics put this one in the \"maybe\" catagory, I'll leave that up for the individual to decide for themselves, but frankly I'm tired of every game now trying to cash in on multiplayer where they can put that effort into tweaking and bettering the actual game.Bottom line it's a decent game with a good story that will draw you in, give you plenty of alternate time-line weapons to kill maim & murder sci-fi/communist enemies with, tosses in a few pop-culture references for those who are paying attention (LOST & Metroid or half-life I'm not specifically sure, for starters) and keep you entertained.

A lot of people have complained that the board game gameplay and rules have been warped or abandoned altogether for this video game. Well...that IS because it's a video game. How exactly would you expect to play the literal Twister on your PS3? Obviously they had to reinterpret them.Hasbro Family Game Night 3 uses a theme park as the general menu when it comes to selecting what games you want. It's a nice way to present them, but little is done with this idea. Your character can be customized, but there are few options. And in order to get the most out of this game you'll need to play with 4 players, which is best done with 4 controllers. But really...how many PS3 owners will own 4? It can be played online, but it's a wasteland with very few players.In order to be fair and unbiased I will review each game and its remix separately.Yahtzee Hands Down:A poker-type game played with cards. Can be really slow and generally takes ages for things to happen. When playing alone the game seems deliberately programmed to never let you win. Also has the hardest trophies of the entire game.Remix:Best played with 4 players to maintain the hectic feel. Otherwise it's even slower.Clue:Pretty good game. The 4 player gameplay is a little clumsy (involves 3 players not looking at the screen every other turn) but still quite good. The transitions between 2D and 3D boards is quite annoying and pointless though.Remix:Horrible. Badly programmed (the board is reset virtually every turn, which itself takes 30 seconds). Very slow.Game of Life:The best game, and can be really good with 4 players. Very much an interpretation of the board game come alive. The most immersive of the 5.Remix:Largely the same, only a bit faster and streamlined. Still quite good.Twister:A game very much in the style of Dance Dance Revolution. The most fast-paced game of the five and one of the most enjoyable. Nothing at all like the real game, but a nice re-imagining of the theme.Remix:I honestly didn't notice much of a difference between this and Twister.Mouse Trap:A very, very slow game with lots of pointless camera pans and zooms and cut-scenes involving the trap being constructed/operated. Camera doesn't even cover the trap mechanisms properly leaving you wondering how exactly it is supposed to work. With 4 players you can be waiting a long time in between shots. Certainly the most repetitive and boring game of the bunch.Remix:Largely incomprehensible. The playing area is an eyesore are the rules are poorly laid out. Feels not so much a remix as it feels like some kid has ripped apart the original game and put it back in a nonsensical order.The entire package has its ups and downs but is still worth playing if you want a relatively easy Platinum (save for a couple of nightmare trophies).

McKenzie", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "If you know what this package is going in, you have a better chance of liking it.  A lot of people have (understandably) trashed \"Hasbro Family Game Night 3\" simply because the 5 games they included aren't the original games we grew up with.I won't sugarcoat it: There are some seriously puzzling decisions going on here.  I think this collection of party games is okay, but not great.  There's some fun to be had, but nothing to guarantee a satisfying purchase.NOTE - Every game has a Regular Mode and a Remix ModeTWISTERLet's get the elephant in the room out of the way, both Modes for this game suck.  It's like \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Dance Dance Revolution\", and doesn't even remotely resemble a game of Twister.  All you do is press the controller buttons to match the screen, and it's all done to a short selection of cheesy music that lasts about 30-60 seconds tops per session.  Honestly, Twister on this disc just sucks.MOUSE TRAPThe Regular Mode is perhaps the most faithful to the board game from this PS3 disc.  Instead of building the Mouse Trap machine itself, you play a short minigame to determine how many pieces get built at a time.  The videogame does a better job of building the machine, obviously.  Let's face it --- the real thing was a pain in the butt.  On the other hand, rather than watching a real-life marble contraption, you watch a video game do it for you, which isn't as much fun if you ask me.The Remix Mode is a neat change of pace.  You basically roll the dice to maneuver a figure-8 style board, collect cheese, and construct mini-traps that hurt both you AND the other players.  Nothing special, but it's still fun for a few playthroughs.I like Mouse Trap the board game, but I don't love it.  So, the videogame gets the same recommendation from me.YAHTZEE HANDS DOWNThis game probably has the most replay value in the back.  Instead of rolling dice to win Yahtzee combinations, players are dealt playing cards to try to match the combination in the middle of the board.  Players can swap out cards, hoping their next turn will reveal better results.  The game itself is pretty solid, but the AI will occasionally give up cards that could've helped their own hands.  Other than that, it's a good one.THE GAME OF LIFENow, this is more like it!  I don't remember the board game very well, but with the Regular Mode, the basic concepts of choosing Career-vs-College, raising a family, spinning the wheel to move, and trying to make the most money are in tact.  There are a few silly variations, like playing simple minigames instead of choosing cards from a deck.  Most of these minigames are fun, but it sucks that the Getting Married space always makes you do this stupid dance minigame like Twister.The Remix Mode is basically the same game, except you get rewarded and penalized with move spaces, and there's no money involved.  First player to reach the end wins the game.  Simple, but a decent alternative to those who don't enjoy the money management.I'm also disappointed that you can't look at the whole game board very clearly.  But I still had fun, and have played several times alone and with my wife.  We both find The Game of Life to be a fun diversion.CLUE/CLUEDOOddly enough, this is very faithful to original board game, and its changes are solid choices for a videogame adaptation.  Instead of just doing the traditional checklist of murder clues, you have to earn the right to narrow your search by landing on spaces that give you Rumor Points.  Play any of a few minigames, fill up your Rumor Point meter, and investigate away.  The videogame does a poor job of explaining the intricacies, but once you get the hang of it, it works very well.The Remix Mode is also a lot of fun.  Before rolling your dice, there's an Event Die that changes things up.  A pool party resets the players & suspects around the game board, while other rolls will eliminate possible rooms & suspects.  I prefer the slower-paced Regular Mode, but my wife and I both loved the craziness from Remix ModeClue/Cluedo is my easily favorite of the pack.OVERALLMy Reactions:+ Twister sucks.+ Mouse Trap is decent.+ Yahtzee Hands Down is quite good.+ The Game of Life is worth playing again and again.+ Clue/Cluedo is easily the best of the bunch.My wife pretty much agrees with me, except she prefers The Game of Life over Clue.  We both loved playing those two games the most.It's very simple: The board games are better than what this videogame disc provides for you, and this disc doesn't do a good job explaining how to play these games (except for the embarrassing Twister).  Twister is a huge letdown.  Mouse Trap is perhaps too faithful to the board game, but it's decent.  Yahtzee Hands Down is its own style, but still very fun.  Thankfully, Clue/Cluedo and The Game of Life are solid adaptations of the classic games, with acceptable/forgivable changes.There are some unlockables, but the game does a terrible job of explaining where they are with even those!  And even though I love PS3 Trophies, they never make or break the quality of a game.I suggest you just find some buddies and play the old-school board games, or go online and find some way of playing games more faithful to the original versions.  But if you're really desperately looking for a PS3 disc that people can play these games on --- and understand that they're very different versions --- then pay 20 dollars at the most.If you have friends to play with (online or offline), then \"Hasbro Family Game Night 3\" is a fun way to kill a few hours here and there.

Honeslty the games in the second Family Game didn't appeal to me, but Family Game Night 3 is right up my alley.  It includes the Game of Life, Clue, Twister, Mouse Trap and Yahtzee.  All of them are my absolute favorites, especially Clue!  With two little kids, we don't really get the chance to break out a board game too much these days, but it is much easier to turn on our Wii, play, and save it.Each game has a classic and a remixed version which gives extra ways to play so you don't get bored!  I will warn you though the Game of Life takes awhile to finisih if you play it 4-player (we had two computer players.)  Twister is nothing at all like you'd expect, it is a game where you have to watch beats on the screen and hit the corresponding buttons that it shows, easy but it gets challenging!  Mouse Trap is a game I hadn't played since a kid and I don't really remember, in the Wii game you play a mini-game to set up the trap and then you spend the end of the game rolling to see who gets trapped - a little slow but fun.  Yahtzee is another favorite of mine and although this game is a little different than the traditional dice game, it is fun and addicting!Overall, I really like Family Game Night 3 and think it is a great way to play old board game favorites on the Wii.

I was, in fact, very intrigued and excited when it was announced that they were doing a game about Twister. It is essentially a boring version of DDR. If Twister was human, it would be suing for name defamation. 1 star out of 5.Yahtzee Hands Down: It takes awhile to get the hang of this, and it's not the worth the time in the end. Not very fun. 1 star out of 5.Mousetrap: The fun thing about playing Mousetrap as a kid was building the contraption. Now that it's done electronically, this game isn't much more fun than an electronic version of Chutes & Ladders. 3 stars out of 5.Clue: I was most excited about this, and consequently most disappointed by it. In the original board game, you can take a \"guess\" whenever you enter a room. In this version, you start a \"rumor\" every time you earn 6 rumor points. You get rumor points by walking around the board, landing on spaces that have rumor points within the tiles. So essentially you're mindlessly wandering around, looking for rumor tiles, and when you do this enough times, you'll find out who the killer is by rule of elimination. The original was fun because you could use reverse psychology on others to trick them into thinking they know who actually dunnit, but this game takes all those aspects away. 2 stars out of 5.Game of Life: Very, very slow pace. This is the best part of the entire game, and is \"Family Game Night 3\"'s best attempt at redemption. It's nice that you don't have to add and do the math, but this game is actually quite different than the original (can't buy insurance for your car or house, and there is no real variety to the spaces). 3 stars out of 5.I thought this game would be great, if not for any innovative features, then at least for the fact I wouldn't have to buy Clue, The Game of Life, and Mousetrap separately as board games.

In fact, I wanted to play THIS flying game, and I wanted it to be fun.  I ignored all the negative reviews and bought it.  I'm an easy gamer - I can be amused by nearly any game, although my twitch-reflexes aren't what they used to be as I approach the fifth decade of life.Still, I saw this had an extended single player story mode, and I wanted to fly a lot of different aircraft and participate in missions, and no way did I want to get online and fight 12 year olds, so I bought a copy last week and have been playing it.I have to say I'm annoyed.  Ubisoft came really close with this game.  There's a lot of great stuff in it.  I love the music - especially the load screen/menu panel music.  And the first 5 or 10 missions are actually really fun - well crafted, full of detail, realistic aircraft, UAVs and so on with different characteristics to explore.  Marking buildings and ships for later destruction using a Predator-type UAV interface - lots of fun.  Night landing on a carrier after a bomb run in an F-35 - spectacular.  Handling a bulky A-10 Warthog as it gets peppered by flak and bombs entrenched ground positions - great.But then there's a certain mission.  The first screen for it has three spelling mistakes: \"rein\" for \"reign\" and two instances of the word \"seperatist.\"  And that is your alert that, basically, you are done with the fun part of the game and are going to get into some hastily done, shoddily crafted missions.  Really, Tom Clancy?  Russia invades Norway to capture an oil derrick to replace their own that got blown up by some terrorist nuke?  I might have believed that in the 80's - shades of SSI's North Atlantic '86, actually.  But come on.I actually played the game most of the way through until a final dogfight on 'standard' difficulty mode, where I discovered that the strategy was this:  Turn at full bank on afterburner always, or be hit by a missile.  While turning on afterburner, try to get the 'boss' plane in your sights.  Your missiles won't lock on him - he's the boss, after all.  So, after several hours and countless restarts, rack up 100 hits on him with your machine gun without dying - one at a time, each separated by minutes - and then do the same for the other two planes that accompany the boss.I gave up.  It was boring and annoying - supremely so - and it was the climax of a series of missions that were just more boring and more annoying.  It felt like good programmers wrote 5 or 6 good missions and then they brought in the B team to churn out another 20 crappy ones.In addition, attention to little details is poor.  There is one point where cutscenes play after a long mission for 15 minutes in a row.  They're not pausable and not replayable, so if you need to use the restroom, you will miss some.  After you complete a mission, you get a progress screen.  Your progress is saved, right?  No.  Enter the next mission and start the next cutscene; only then is your progress saved.  Manual save?  No way.Also, I hated this: if your plane is pointed the wrong way when a cutscene starts, sometimes your plane will crash into the ground while the cutscene is playing, killing you.  Now you have to restart that mission.  The cutscene audio fights with the 'you're dead' audio, then just cuts off and you are booted to the 'you're dead' menu.  Any warning when the cutscene is going to start?  No.  Any way of interrupting the cutscene?  No.  Do the plane controls work during the cutscene?  No.  It's just an insta-death, well into a mission, with no save point anywhere nearby.  Feels like a software bug, really.  Good game designers know better.The game locked up my PS3 3 times so far during play, by the way, requiring restart.  (When you're made to install the required software update, be aware you'll be waiting with the progress bar stuck at 17% for about 10 minutes.  That's apparently intended behavior, not one of the hard freezes I'm talking about.)There's some neat stuff in the game.  The early cutscenes are tight and exciting, the planes are photorealistic and have a variety of weaponry, modes, and handling traits, the voice actors are really good.  Controls are so so and made my hands sore after about an hour, but they can be customized.  Free flight mode is a lot of fun - almost worth the price of admission - but come on, give us something to shoot at.  And for pete's sake, do not make me 'unlock' the planes.  I will never do that.  Just let me fly 'em.Plenty of female characters too, including pilots, which is good; unfortunately, every piece of dialog directed at a female character in the entire game includes one of the following phrases: \"Calm down,\" \"settle down,\" \"simmer down.\"  Sexism at its worst - got a comment from my wife.  I hate this because it makes the entire video game industry look bad and reduces my chance of retaining a video-game-compatible wife, so companies should take notice and quit doing it.On balance, it got me off deck, flying, and shooting missiles, which gains it 3 stars.  The best parts of this game are better than Dropship: United Peace Force, a 2-star game with some 4-star flying missions.  There's gotta be a 5 star flying game out there - I like Afterburner Climax, even though it's a port of an 80's game - but I haven't found the real 5 star flying game yet.Hawx 2 ain't it.

Plot, graphics & animations, computer controlled enemies and allies, and game play are seriously hindered, lacking, or not thought out at all.  Please, do not purchase this game or pay full price, you will be wasting hard earned money.The plot, oh the plot.  They ripped off sections of popular games such as the AC-130 gunning, attempted to do the \"multiple story lines that converge\" method of plot, and clearly did not put much effort in telling a coherent story.  As with most Clancy games, there is an overall story line that spans from EndWar to Ghost Recon.  This game I guess is taking place in an alternative reality that ignored what happened in the previous game and all other games in this universe. Not to mention complete disregard for logic, in several parts of the game your fighter is not armed with missiles for no discernible reason, aircraft carriers double as landing craft, and its an acceptable choice to sink oil tankers. So, if story isn't such an issue for you, there are more reasons to not like this.The graphics of this game are definitely lack luster and not on par for its generation of games.  In cut scenes the lips of the characters don't sync up with speech, a really, really, dumb failure.  This sort of characterizes the game, it just seemed like the design group didn't care.  The maps are big but the models still look like they came out of a game years ago, small details I know but when you keep crashing into fuzzy poles, it gets annoying. The use of real maps is overhyped and a gimmick at best. The scales never seem right and I'm pretty sure they just threw the models in at random. But wait, there's more!Your computer allies clearly take the \"if I stay away from danger, someone else will deal with it\" approach to combat.  In HAWX 1, you could tell your wingmen to cover you or go out and engage.  In this game, you are almost always a wingman and the only times you are a lead is when you are by yourself.  So, don't count on your allies to watch out for you or help complete objectives or support craft to fire at anything.  The enemies though take full advantage of the good old lazy programmer approach of infinite ammo.  You will have portions of the game where you will endless circle, trying to lock on with the guns because missiles are ineffective against what seems to be flare infused fuel in your target's engine.  The game's story was clearly balanced for multiplay with three of your friends (Assuming you have three friends with this game) being able to handle the vast number of enemies being thrown at you.  This brings me to the last part of shortcomings.You have no alternative control layouts, ability to change sensitives, or choice of aircraft.  The game was meant to be played with a joystick.  Like the mech game that required a giant $100 controller to play it properly, this game was designed for those of you who play lots of flight games and have put down the cash for a joystick.  For the rest of us, deal with it.  You will find yourself just flying in random loops, dodging endless missiles, and being thrown off by the very jumpy controls.  Push the stick a little too hard and before you know it you are hugging a tree, hard.  Then another \"If it worked in the first game we shouldn't do it\" moment was with the no choice of planes and loadouts.  I can understand from a story point of view that Russians won't field US planes or when expecting flying CAS you won't have bombs.  But by denying players the option of choosing to forgo the radar guided missiles (Good luck keeping those on target) for multi-AA missiles you just frustrate everyone. Oh and the landing/takeoff/mid-air-refuel stuff, it got old after the first time.  Expect to spend minutes with the assistant thing (They also wrecked this system, its useless) trying land to end a mission.  If I wanted to do those things, I would play a realistic fighter game.Overall, this is a frustrating way to spend your time.  If you're patient, more power to you.  If your like me and would like the flow of the game uninterrupted by bad controls, allies, and such just play the original.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Play the origional", "unixReviewTime": 1298764800, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2011"}

I was eager to get this game because I had seen some great in-game footage of the AC-130 mission and landings were now included. Before I start telling you why this game is a disappointment let me tell you what is good about it.1) The graphics are just as good if not better than the first HAWX. The detail of the maps are great and give you an almost there feel. The planes seem better as well. The plane graphics seem more realistic with a more war worn look that's not as clean as before.2) It's more realistic. Even though you still have a ton of missiles available it seems the designers spent more time making it tougher to hit the target.3) The A.I. is a lot more difficult. Gone are the days of sending out 4 missiles at a time, every map, at every threat. I only remember one map where multi-target was available and that was for ground targets.4) New technology. You not only get to control an AC-130 but there are drones and precision guided bombs that expand the gameplay.Now for the not-so-good parts of the game. I really like tough games, they are a challenge and make for more fun but this game almost made me snap the disc in half. Here's why.1) Your wingmen are absolute garbage. They don't seem to do anything other than warn you of incoming missiles, as if the red warning lights, picture in picture, and warning buzzers weren't enough.2) You will spent 90% of your time dodging missiles and 10% of your time TRYING to have a decent dog fight. The MIG-29's are great they are extremely tough to get a lock on but as soon as you get any where close to missile lock you have to break off in order to escape incoming missiles.3) The missions are scripted. You can't pick which targets to engage like you could in the first HAWX. If you are trying to protect a ground base from tanks you'll be forced to break off and take out incoming fighters. When you attempt to kill the fighters the ground forces practically destroy the base. Once you get rid of the fighters and try to take on the ground forces again you are taken to a cut-scene or the mission ends. That's what really gets me, the enemy doesn't retreat if you overwhelm them like the first, its just over.4) The storyline is boring. Rebel forces take over some Russian nukes, WOW that hasn't been done to death. Thankfully you can skip the load-screens after about thirty seconds.5) This isn't that big of a deal but the game is pretty sexist. There is a female pilot who talks quite a bit throughout the campaign and she is pretty much the only source of a \"team\" feel. When she talks she is almost instantly told to be quite by one of your wingmen. In the end she sacrifices herself trying to take out an enemy target and the game is like, \"alright she's dead who's up next?\".6) No choices of what planes or missile packages you get to fight with. You are given some really bad planes to take into combat and don't expect to play with too many US aircraft, the game is set as a world conflict so you only get to play the F-22 and Warthog in a couple missions, otherwise your Russian, French or English.The first game was great it had creative and fun missions like protecting the President of the United States and taking on wave after wave of ground targets. This game is intense but I would say its not very fun. There seems to have been a complete lack of imagination on this one. I have only played the multiplayer a few times and it seems to be a rank up as you go system so maybe that is worth the price of the game. All I can say is the campaign is a huge let down.ALL FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED.

Wells", "helpful": [16, 19], "reviewText": "HAWX 2 puts you in the cockpit of a variety of fighters and in control of some drones in order to accomplish a variety of missions against a stiff opposition of anti-air fire and enemy aircraft.  As a preface to this review, I own and enjoyed the first HAWX and I only play with the xbox controller (though I am thinking about investing in a flight stick).HAWX 2 does some things very well.  The AI aircraft in the single-player campaign are much smarter than in the first incarnation of the game.  Dipping and diving and trying to lock on to enemy aircraft is the heart of HAWX 2.  Moreover the backdrop of deserts, rugged mountain peaks, and other locations are beautifully done. Screaming through mountain passes at tree top levels has never looked more realistic on the 360.  The take off and landing effects are also very cool (especially on aircraft carriers).  The narrative cut scenes that propell the story are ok (but I don't really play for the story).The multiplayer is tons of fun.  There are co-op mission modes and team battle. Team battle is up to 4 on 4 fighter combat and has a number of customizable features.  You can pick from a variety of maps (points can be scored hitting NPC targets as well as enemy players).  But what I loved was that you can select an \"era\": korean war, vietnam conflict, cold war, modern, or open.  This era selection restricts plane choices to those available during the selected conflict.  Also a various realism factors can be engaged to make the multiplayer the shining area of HAWX2.Finally the perks system is very well done.  You rank up both in your experience level and with each plane.  To unlock customizable loadouts, you must play with each plane.  Also, as you rank up special effects that give your team brief bonuses can be unlocked (these include radar jamming, camoflage, no missile lock warning for the enemies, etc).Some things that are exactly like HAWX 1. All the planes have a lot of missiles (sometimes 30 or 40 missiles) and machine guns even stealthy modern planes that do not have the old dog-fight standby.  The \"realistic\" mode in multiplayer helps to correct this.And HAWX 2 missed the mark completely in two places: 1) campaign aircraft selection & 2) \"assistance off\" mode.  First, In trying to stick to some sort of story-plot the plane you pilot in the campaign is scripted. I did notice that the rewards for ranking up did not seem to include the great variety of planes from HAWX 1,but this may change as DLC becomes available.  Secondly, The assistance off move your perspective from the standard 1st or 3rd person to a zoomed-out third person.  The idea is so you can see more of the battlefield.  In reality you have very little control of your plane and the camera angles are wonky so you mostly fly in circles and shoot wildly.All-in-all, HAWX 2 is a good game for your flight combat fix.  It has some shortcomings, and is not a revolutionary advance over HAWX 1, but I can see myself flying the unfriendly skies for a good number of hours.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Get Your Air Combat Fix", "unixReviewTime": 1287446400, "reviewTime": "10 19, 2010"}

Over HAWX they improved the graphics and added a couple of neat features.  The \"neat features\" I refer to are the ability to finally take off and land (also taxi) even on an aircraft carrier at times.  The story mode isn't that great, it has nothing to do with the book (neither did HAWX for that matter).  Here are my pros and cons:Pros-Better graphics-Can now taxi and land aircraft-Has more weapons to choose from-Online is slightly better (more options)Cons-CANNOT CHOOSE YOUR AIRCRAFT OF PREFERENCE!!!!  (I don't want to be stuck flying a mig or su during certain missions... stick me with an F16 for all I care...)-I will say again for con #2 that I want to fly planes of my choice, not a random foreign fighter jet.-Story lacks a bit-They incorporated several levels similar to Call of Duty's AC130 levels.  If I wanted to play that, I'd put in Call of Duty 4.-If you play the game with an aviation stick (flight stick), you suffer in dogfights from regular controllers, especially in the assistance modes where you can \"bend the laws of gravity\".Conclusion:I went back to play HAWX 1 just to choose my aircraft and play more clarified missions after a couple of weeks of playing HAWX2.  Aviation games have never reached the level of potential that I expect from them.  WWII games have been done to death and modern airplane games lack in detail.  Thus far HAWX1 or AC4 are your best choice.  Maybe the new Ace Combat will be worth playing.

Rube Goldberg was famous for 'depicting complex devices that perform simple tasks in indirect, convoluted ways.'The object of each level is to use the items that are already present on the screen and add the objects from a kind of pasteboard section to create a machine that completes a specified task.In other words, you are given an requirement at the beginning of a level and you have to build a machine that makes that requirement happen. It might be to move a marble to a basket or to pop a series of balloons. The fun is that some objects are fixed in place and cannot be moved. You have to work with those objects or obstacles while adding the extras you get with each level. There is no guide as to where your extras belong, you have to think it out and try different placements. When you think you have a working machine, you hit the play button and watch as all the parts do their thing. If it works, great, if not, it's back to the drawing board.Objects include everything from walls, gears, conveyor belts, balloons, scissors, weights, rope, catapults, etc. The farther you get in the game, the more complex the objects become and the more detailed the set-up of each machine can get.Each level is timed but once you run out of time, there is no penalty. The more time you have left over, the higher your score. I found that once I took the time to complete a level, I would go right back and redo it as quickly as possible to get a \"perfect\" score.There are additional challenges unlocked as you gain more perfects and complete more sections of levels.It is fun and making the machines work is really neat. It definitely takes logical thinking and pre-planning but the nice thing is that if you start your machine and it doesn't work, you don't have to reset everything. It all stays where you left it. Many of the puzzles require very fine adjustments of boards or walls to get the correct trajectory of a ball or marble.I had previously playedGravityand found it fun but cumbersome because the pieces were so delicate in their placement and the pull of gravity was constant. In Logic Machines, you can take your time placing an object and it doesn't fall down or move until you hit the play button. Many items defy gravity and stay where you leave them. Where as in Gravity, you had to balance all objects exactly as gravity would interact with them.I have really enjoyed playing this so far and find that the advancement of difficulty is at a good pace. A great game for the inventor in all of us!****************UPDATE: I reduced my rating from 5 to 4 stars for two reasons. After playing the game through to the end, I was disappointed that there weren't more levels. It seemed to go too quickly. Some of the puzzles took less than 30 seconds and others took a couple of minutes. So overall, with 75 Adventure Puzzles, you are at the end fairly fast. The other problem is that you cannot save multiple player scores. So it's one person's game unless you clear the scores and start over. Still a great game if you know the limitations.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Rube Goldberg Would Be Proud!", "unixReviewTime": 1287360000, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2010"}

First of all, the game itself is great. It also is much meatier than the last one, and with the promise of future DLC it will likely double in size and gametime.The story really doesn't have much to spoil but I'll spare most of the details. You play as \"The Courier,\" a delivery boy who winds up shot in the head with no idea how or why. After a short tutorial (skippable thank goodness) and a few errands you're sent on your way. Your inevitable destination: The near-wholly preserved New Vegas, run by the enigmatic Mr. House. Along the way you hear about and/or meet members of the two other main factions, Caesars Legion and the NCR (New California Republic), one of which you'll eventually wind up siding with. Or will you?... Although the story this time around isn't a \"fate of the world\" scenario as it was in Fallout 3, it still will have you thirsting for more as you play.Gameplay-wise it's pretty much the same old fallout, with a couple additions to the formula. Speech checks are now skill-checks, in that speech is not the only skill you'll need to pass some parts of a conversation. This is the developers way of trying to make players even out skills more, although there are some that will be needed less and may get overlooked. A new addition to the game this time is Reputation, which is like your Karmic standing with individual factions (of which there are a dozen or so, including the three major ones). Do something to help a faction and you gain reputation, possibly losing some with another faction. Also added to the field is the much talked about Hardcore mode, which despite it's name is NOT a \"harder than hard\" mode, as it can be played on easy, normal or hard. Instead what it is, is a gamemode where you are required to eat, sleep, and drink regularly or else perish. Fast travel is restricted in that you can't travel if you'd dehydrate or starve before reaching your destination. Unlike other modes where companions are unkillable (a very welcome addition personally), in hardcore they can and will die if you're not careful. Weapons this time around have mods and special ammo for them, allowing players to pick and choose their fighting style. Companions are a little more diverse than before; but still could do with a few more non-humans perhaps? At least they have their own backstories of sorts, which the Courier can investigate further via sidequests that activate as they get to know said companion.The actual look to the game is essentially fallout 3 but with a browner tone and some more desert-based motifs. This is possibly due to the restriction of the Havok and Gamebryo engines, both of which are outdated and have many more restrictions than other, new ones. The Gamebryo engine is also notorious for being the cause behind the games many glitches and bugs, the majority of which have been talked at ad nauseum and therefore I won't delve too far into.Glitches aside though, the game truly is an engaging and fun experience, and most of the bugs aren't gamebreaking. If you're a fan of the series, pick it up asap. If you're not entirely sure yet, hold off for a couple of months while Bethesda tweaks it a little and works on the bugs. Either way, it's a great buy and definitely worth the pricetag.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great game, despite many bugs", "unixReviewTime": 1289865600, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2010"}

Hundreds of thousands of paying customers can't continue important companion quests or can't finsh MAIN quests, or get the black screen of death because ALL THEIR SAVES ARE CORRUPTED!!!!This is without a doubt THE most broken and NOT ready for prime-time game I've evet played.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Zero Day Patch Doesn't fix the game-breakin bugs", "unixReviewTime": 1289260800, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2010"}

That's really a good thing though because it's fun and addictive. But it's also a bad thing because it's still buggy and lacking the graphics of newer games. New Vegas puts you into the shoes of a courier who's had a case of amnesia (bullet to the head style) and now it's up to you to find out what exactly got you into that situation. From the get go, you can tell that the Mojave is a bit different than the Wasteland in Fallout 3. It's as if people turned to the icons of Vegas the way people would turn to idols. It affects the way gangs and people act. This brings a lot of character and quirkiness that was really a bit more serious in Fallout 3. They really do play almost identical though aside from being able to mod your weapons and having a few new items. It's still the game I love though and will consume plenty of time just like its bigger brother.Pros+ Doesn't stray from what made Fallout 3 work. Still plenty of hours to be had here, probably just as many as Fallout 3.+ Factions give you plenty of re-playability just to see what happens with the different choices you make.+ Plenty of character in this game. Lots to explore. Lots to find. Lots to blow up.Cons- Not really as many hidden stories and easter eggs as Fallout 3 had.- Still buggy. Keep that cache cleared.- Some equipment was significantly downgraded. (Chinese Stealth Suit for example)- Still got those same old graphics.Collector Extras+Love the poker chips and playing cards.- Graphic novel was a little bleh. Who ever watches those 'making of' DVD's anyway?= Probably not worth the extra $10 but if you catch this at a discount, go for it. I did.VerdictPlay this game if you don't buy it. This is one of the best series out there even with the bugs. It deserves to be played. Same warning I gave for Fallout 3 though. Don't let it consume your life because it will.

This has to be one of the better editions of any game so far when it comes with extras.But first the game itself since this is what brings the score down.  I was a big fan of Fallout 3 and played it for well over 150 hours.  It had lots of variety, the combat VATS system was fun, especially the results, and worth the $60.  Now 2 years later and you have a kind of sequel, but more of a rehash of the same game.  The environments, especially the vaults looked very similar to Fallout 3 and the creatures haven't changed graphically.  As I was playing Fallout: New Vegas, I started to get a sense of deja vu when traveling to some of the areas or interacting with some of the characters.  Its a been there, done that feeling.  Now Fallout 3 did when game of the year, so the developers must have thought little change was needed from the formula.  After all, if its not broke, don't fix it.  Unfortunately, there was problems with the game as discussed in many reviews.  The game has many glitches that I have ever played before.  And frustration hits when it freezes during a transitions.  It has happened to many 3 times, which is not a lot considering I played 92 hours of it, but it happened during a main plot sequence or during the last battle.  There is a lot of underground creatures hiding that you would never be able to see without the compass indicator.  Additionally, I dont think Fallout 3 had this many software problems as this game had.  Overall, the game is more of an expansion to Fallout 3 than a new game.  But as I had found Fallout 3 to be more fun and loved the environment, I found Fallout: New Vegas to be dull at times.  There are the fetch quests and quests where you travel to different places.  Most of the map is full of desert.  Boring, dull scenery.  Also, I found the New Vegas quests to be average.  Nothing exciting.Now for the Collectors Edition content.  As I stated in the first sentence the extras are worth getting.THE GRAPHIC NOVEL, \"All Roads\", is well written and illustrated.  This was created by real comic book writers and it shows.  The art is very bright and detailed.  The story, if read before, gives you an insight into what happened prior to the opening scene of the game and why the main character got in trouble.THE POKER CHIPS are replica of the in-game poker chips used in each of the casinos.  Each has their own looks and they look and feel like real Las Vegas chips.THE LUCKY 38 PLATINUM CHIP is part of the main plot of the game and is include here.  It has a weight of real metal and is very detailed.THE NEW VEGAS CARAVAN DECK has every interactive character of the game printed in each of the 54 cards, 2 jokers included, with a quote they say in the game.  After finishing the game, I went to check each card again and I remembered meeting each character.  Also, the art is in the style of old paintings with an old appearance look to it.DOCUMENTARY DVD is just like any making of DVD.  Nothing special.I love this casino set.  The deck of cards and the poker chips are well worth extra money.I would recommend getting the collectors edition over just the game because it is a great value.  Though the game has problems, it IS worth the $60 since I did spend over 90 hours on it and could have easily spent another 20 hours.  But unfortunately you will be frustrated playing the game as you would wish it was more smoothly played and wished there was more interesting quests.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "More like Fallout 3 and a half!!", "unixReviewTime": 1289779200, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2010"}

You were a courier and your mission is to find out why and what it has to do with the package that you was carrying...If you played Fallout 3 then you can expect more of the same but of course with new tweaks and additions. Even with that, it also been reviewed has having many bugs. I haven't came across any but they are there, constant reviews wouldn't point out something otherwise. I will say that that there is a firmware update coming next week to fix major bugs. As for new additions, they have factions that can effect who you fight at times depending on what clothes you wearing. You can blend in with a gang so they won't attack you (unless they have a scout that can see through your disguise) and there the world is much brighter. The world of New Vegas adds new cool missions and since its taking place in Nevada, you can gamble with many people. Its surprisingly bigger than Fallout 3 and I put over 120 hours into that game. This one can add a lot to but there haven't been yet any huge exciting moments as Fallout 3. As for everything else, it plays just as well, it doesn't though look that much better than then the last title, but like I said, its a huge and deep game that has long replay value.Get the collector's edition? I don't recommend it unless your a huge fan of the series. The game is good but not stellar by any means.

I ordered the PS3 Collector's Edition. It is sitting here still sealed in the box it shipped in. It arrived on the day it released and I ordered a standard edition the same day for the PS3. It is buggy and has some different bugs than the PC version, such as not being able to pick up and item ( Q-35 gun in the Repconn Headquarters for one ). It freezes up and it is a good idea to save,save, and save some more. I have some 100+ hours when a friend gave me a copy of the PC version. I decided to see how that played ( it looks good on the PS3 and my 42\" Toshiba HDTV, but it looks even better on this PC with the ati 5770 Card. I have some 60+ Hours in the PC version and it is playing out differently than the PS3 version. In Fallout 3, you could be Saintly or Pure Evill or anywhere in between throughout the game world. Not so, here, you can be all over the boards. I am Idolized in a couple of places and despised with the Legion ( not on too good of terms with the NCR either for that matter ). Wasn't real thrilled with Steam sticking their nose into my gaming, but it hasn't proven to be a problem. If they ever work all the bugs out, this should really prove to be a great game. As for any add ons, I suspect one will involve the locked gates at the Outpost on I-15. They did seem to toughen up the Deathclaws, not that they needed it. Has some interesting weapons as well plus some familiar ones. I gave it 4 stars for fun due to the bugs. I am a moderator of an online forum and a member and myself are playing this and have started a thread where we trade experiences, which are vastly different in the direction of the game.

{"reviewerID": "A8RGWWCC1PVMQ", "asin": "B003N0YCDA", "reviewerName": "NeoTristan", "helpful": [34, 37], "reviewText": "War...War never changes.  But Fallout has over the course of its long-winded history.It started as a spiritual sequel to 'Wasteland', CRPG that started 'Post-Apocalyptic' gameplay back in 1988 by Interplay, whose division Black Isle is behind seminal CRPG classic such as 'Baldur's Gate' and yes, you guessed it, 'Fallout' and 'Fallout 2'.After Interplay was disintegrated, some of the people went to Bioware, some of them went on to found Troika, talented but unfortunate developer who met its demise after three original and interesting but very buggy CRPG with dissimal sales.  Some of them went on to found Obsidian, yet another talented but somewhat disappointing developer whose track record includes 'Knights of the Old Republic 2',  'Neverwinter Nights 2', 'Alpha Protocol' and upcoming 'Dungeon Siege 3'.Why am I reciting a history lesson here?  When Bethesda acquired the right for 'Fallout' IP from Interplay and released its biggest financial success yet with 'Fallout 3', fans were divided into two distinctive factions and has been feuding over which is better.Faction Red: Bethesda ruined the memory of the greatest CRPG of all time by dumbing down everything we loved about our precious franchise.  It's 'Oblivion with guns'.Faction Blue: Bethesda successfully resuscitated the dead franchise by streamlining many archaic elements and implementing new refreshing elements.  It retains all the core elements from 'Fallout'.  We love it.I personally love all of them and none of them are perfect to feud over petty differences in semantics.After court-feuding over who's got the right to the entire 'Fallout' series, Bethesda settled with the right to all future single-player Fallout game and right to license the right to Interplay to the development of 'Fallout MMORPG'.  So both 'Fallout 4' and 'Fallout Online' are coming; both will be published by Bethesda and 'Fallout 4' will be also developed by Bethesda.So with the help of creative minds behind the original 2D isometric Fallout games using the same engine and costruction set Bethesda did for FO3, can Obsidian right the wrong by Bethesda?  (Bethesda still owns the IP and publishes it.)  That has been the question by Faction Red.If you are a fan of 'Fallout 3', rest assured FONV is exactly like FO3 with nothing taken away with some newly improved elements added.  You will feel right at home with the game.  Control, menu, movement, combat, Pipboy and VATS are all identical.  What's added are new perks system, new aiming system and new NPC companion command system.Unlike FO3, there are tons more factions now in play and you can choose to side with certain faction with consequences.  Faction dynamics play much more intimate and important role, and are tied directly to the choices you have to make (think Morrowind).  You cannot possibly satisfiy everyone in FONV.  You'll have to actually play multiple playthrough to experience everything.  Choices you make will definitely make the differrence in character interaction and will give out whopping 27 unique important quests all littered with different endings with each ending giving you various permutations (think Gothic and The Witcher), unlike the cookie-cutter, same-difference 5 endings FO3 offered.  Every time you make someone beneficiary, you will make someone else unhappy.  All of your choices will resullt in some type of consequences.  There is no more good and evil morality play here.  This time, it is a wild wild west.  Everyone is a cutthroat.  In fact, style of the game is reminiscent of old western movie and FO3 rolled into one.Dialogues are much more sarcastic and darkly humorous.  Voice-works are well-done by many celebrities.  Characters are wackier.  General tone of the game is morally even murkier and overall darker, albeit humorous on par with the first two games (especially Fallout 2).Soundtrack once again retains the signature feel of the series by utilizing slew of retro 40s and 50s classic pop music.  Orchestral score is once again done by Inon Zur.While level-cap has been increased to 30, leveling up needs more attention because you cannot be a jack of all trade in FONV; especially in light of new 'Hard-core' mode that is included in the game.  You need to hunt and cook / harvest / steal and eat, you need to drink and you need to sleep to survive or pay the consequence.  You cannot carry infinite amount of ammo either.  You can freely choose whether you want to play as 'Hard-core'.You can now mod your own weapons on the work bench with more variety and freedom than you were able to in FO3.Graphics are still competent but are aging fast now.  The general tone of the color scheme is changed from green to orange.  While Obsidian claims graphic is slightly improved, I think graphically everything looks little bit uglier overall, probably stemming from mismatched color schemes throughout the environment.  Sometimes, the world feels like messy crayon artwork from kindergarten wall.  But the world is much livelier and you now see some level of active civilization represented by glowing neons of Vegas Strip.So it sounds like I am trashing FO3 and praising FONV to no end.  Not so fast.  FO 3 is still a great game but I like FONV slightly better in terms of the improved gameplay.  However, FO3 is much better in depth of contents, presentation and storytelling.  Morrowind and Oblivion is still my king of CRPG with much stronger community support.  So what is wrong with the game?Welcome to the bugfest 2010.  It's a grand feast of technical mess; frame rate stuttering issue, game crashing and freezing, characters stuck in the environment, disappearing act of characters and items (even save-game files make the cameos in the act) are some of the widely reported bugs across the all platforms.  Yes, CRPG and nonlinear, free-formed, open-ended game in gigantic scope as big as FONV will always be buggier than linear, focused games like Halo and Modern Warfare due to virtually impossible task of QA stemming from endless in-game possibilities, and yes, nothing gamebreaking,  But there are tons of minor glitches that are annoying and tiresome when you play the game that gives you anywhere from 40-200 hours and upward.  This is the buggiest Fallout entry.Here's a helpful site to alleviate your potential problems.[...]Another thing is everything in FONV is awfully familiar with FO3, not necessarily a bad thing in itself.  Just don't expect the same kind of awe-inducing wow moment like when you came out of Vault 101 for the first time in FO3 or cinematic end-battle.If you are not a fan of CRPG or you hated FO3, there's nothing new for you to see here.  Just like FO3, this is not a FPS, even with enhanced aiming mechanics.  Hit points and damage are governed by your stats.  This game will be just as boring as FO3 to you.If you are a fan of open-world game such as GTA, be warned; FONV is not a open-world action game.  It is open-ended, nonlinear, free-formed CRPG that focuses on traversing and finding new places, engaging with different characters, performing quests, dungeon-crawling and \"role-playing\".  There are tons of small, interesting and quite often excellent depiction of personal conflicts and backstories, but there's no 'save the humanity' type of grand plot and cinematic cutscenes between each level.And if you think 'Borderlands', which is by the way solid and entertaining action game, is better than FO3, stay away from FONV.  Customization of stats, leveling up, armors and weapons by themselves do not make action game like 'Borderlands' a RPG.  You'll be wondering why your excellent marksmanship repeatedly proven via endless hours of online multiplayer session is not effective in Nevada / Mojave wasteland.Last, but not least, PC version of FONV utilizes Steam, which is the most popular DRM and the least intrusive DRM currently available in the market.  It offers many incentive, convenience and great pricing for older games compared to other DRM, but Steam is still DRM.  Convenience of not having to worry about the actual gamedisc by using Steam is nothing compared to not having any DRM so we can install the game and put away our game for display and collection.  We won't be worrying about gamedisc if DRM doesn't check the disc every five second during the gameplay if the disc is authentic in the first place.  Dual release with non-Steam version after initial release or guaranteed future DRM deactivation patch will surely pacify every morally just legitimate paying customers who genuinely want to support developers but are turned off by hands-on DRM.So why did I still choose PC version over console version?;  GECK, easier patching and community support, because I expected that game like FONV would always be buggy.  To Bethesda's credit, the game looks and plays exactly the same on either PC or console, barring framerate, graphics and resolution, so the experience will be identical unlike other CRPGs like 'Dragon Age: Origins', 'Two Worlds', 'Sacred 2', 'Divinity II', and 'Risen' on consoles to name a few.But to Steam's credit, it's 'one-time only' activation through Steam and it doesn't require for you to keep the disc running in your optical drive once the game is installed.  There's no constant Internet connection requirement while you play your game and there's no installation limit.  And if you are into social-networking aspects of Steam, you won't have much problems.  But if you are turned off by anything other than disc-based DRM, you are warned.  I found myself grudgingly and reluctantly giving up to the spell of Fallout series this time but this is only the second Steam-powered game I purchased since Half-Life 2 back in 2004.Overall, FONV is outstanding CRPG marred only by technical shortcomings and it is an excellent extension of FO3 world created by Bethesda but is also a love letter to the bygone era of glorious golden age of CRPG from the minds of the classic Fallout series in FO3's clothes.  You will find many references made toward FO1 and FO2.  FONV finds the sweet spot between the two warring factions (?) in my opinion.  Short of bringing 'Fallout: Van Buren' to life, this is the best Fallout game you will get.  So jump into the wasteland.FONV is the best Obsidian work to date.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "High-octane Clash of Two 'Fallout' Factions Infested with Bugs", "unixReviewTime": 1287446400, "reviewTime": "10 19, 2010"}

Kinda annoying, but understandable.New Vegas is basically FO3 on steroids, with a new Hardcore mode that puts a meter on everything, ramps up the difficulty, and so on; a slicker system overall, with better aiming outside of VATS (the turn-based element of the game), and the easier-to-use Companion Wheel; and a more interesting and hilarious story that feels like it could go in any direction at any time. Oh, and the awesome soundtrack, with a mix of real 40's/50's music that isn't as well known as what we've generally heard, but great nonetheless.Still, Bethesda REALLY needs to work on their debugging skills: even half a year after it's release, there's plenty of bugs to be found.

With such care and time spent into a license that completely re-imagines it is daunting but Bethesda pulled it off. With the haunting and eerie atmosphere, huge selection of lore friendly weapons, excellent story, dialog, and character design, Fallout 3 became an instant classic of the last decade. New Vegas continues this tradition, but Obsidian (the original developers of Fallout 1 and 2) are one board, and have changed the game slightly that will either piss fans off or please them.New Vegas starts out with you being buried alive after being shot. You are a courier, but a robot named Victor digs you out and Doc Mitchell patches you together. As you come to he talks to you as you select your character design, and SPECIAL just like in Fallout 3. While it's not as memorable as Fallout 3`s baby scene during this setup it works just fine. As you step out into the Mojave Wasteland your eyes adjust to the light and you're set loose in GoodSprings which is New Vegas`s equivalent of Megaton. You meet Sunny Smiles, and she shows you the ropes of the shooting part of the game, and from there you're on your own.The first thing you will notice is that the engine has had a slight upgrade, but not by much. The game still uses the Oblivion engine from Fallout 3, so it's obvious Obsidian is playing it kind of safe. The game is also full of a desert wasteland and Obsidian did the impossible by making a desert feel fun to play in, and not feel deserted, empty, and boring to look at. Of course like in Fallout 3 you headed toward the DC Metro area. In New Vegas you're heading to the Vegas Strip to meet Mr. House who can help you figure out what exactly happened to you.In the mean time there are rival factions battling it out mainly being the New California Republic and the Caesar's Legion. The NCR want order in the Mojave and want to take over The Strip, but Caesar's Legion wants to enslave everyone. There are other smaller factions that you must decide what to do with and each one has tons of missions, and will ultimately decide how easy the end of the game is. Speaking of missions that's one thing you will notice. There are tons and tons of them, but the game is missing the epic set pieces that Fallout 3 had. Instead it's just quest after quest, but they are all designed brilliantly and not one is ever the same.New Vegas still has the VATS (Vault-Tec Automated Targeting System) system, but nothing about it has been change, but there is a new first person iron sights view so with this you will rarely use VATS now. This helps make the action faster and speeds things along. Everything else from Fallout 3 is here, but a major addition is modding your weapons. You can find or buy things like clip extender's, silencers, and scopes to add to your weapons. Additionally you can also break down ammo and create new ones, as well as make aid items from items found throughout the wasteland and cooking them. These new additions are minimal and some people may not even use them, but that's ok. There are a ton of new weapons, enemies, and everything you excepted from Fallout 3 is in here.New Vegas also has amazing dialog, characters, and quests and there is a ton of it. There are quite a few companions to have tag along, and there seems to be an infinite amount of spoken dialog. Player choices still play a huge role in the game so don't think those are gone. The biggest feat for New Vegas is that it, yet once again, portrays a believable, enrapturing world and feels every part as amazing as the Capital Wasteland. There are a lot of easter eggs and tid bits for fans of the classic 90's Fallout games too. New Vegas is just an amazing and engrossing game that you can't get yourself sucked out of. The addition of gambling is a good example which can be done at any casino and can be a lot of fun.The game does have a few flaws such as the copious amount of bugs, the characters look ugly still, and it feels kind of dated. While the engine is solid and works for this game it just needs a huge overhaul for Fallout 4, but die hard fans will appreciate the familiarity. On a side note (that doesn't effect the score) the game has a huge mod community. Within the first week of being out there were over 1,000 mods. While most of them are junk there are some amazing mods that you must have that will make you not want to play the game without them. Character mods to make them look better, sexier, clothing add-ons, quests, weapons you name it. I can't play the game without these amazing mods, but for people who don't care New Vegas is a great game.On an end note New Vegas really sticks true to the RPG genre with tons of perks, a level 30 cap, and somehow makes item sorting fun. From pulling up your Pip-Boy to check your map, fast traveling to discovered locations, or finding little hidden gems and secrets in the nooks and crannies of the world is satisfying. Before you know it 8+ hours will pass and you'll go to bed with a smile on your face knowing that the Mojave Wasteland is safe with you around...or is it?Collector's Edition: If you want to pony up another $30 you can get a beautiful and well put together special edition. The biggest attraction are the real poker chips from each faction of the game plus the 200 Platinum chip. The playing cards are beautifully drawn and each card features a character on the back with a bio and the quality is amazing. You also get the comic book and making-of DVD. Is it worth it? Hell yes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best RPG of 2011", "unixReviewTime": 1332892800, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2012"}

{"reviewerID": "ADLVFFE4VBT8", "asin": "B003N13WF8", "reviewerName": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I am going to say this upfront. My initial plan was to wait until New Vegas' GOTY edition became available and then buy a used copy. Not because I didn't enjoy playing Fallout 3 - I did - but because I expected for other games to keep me occupied for the next couple of months. Sadly, the Two Worlds 2 - a promising RPG - release got postponed to \"early 2011\", GT5 followed suit with their own delay, ArcaniA (Gothic 4) too won't be available on the PS3 until March next year and, based on the PC version reviews I've seen, it may not be a worthy one so... New Vegas was the only decent new RPG actually available for purchase these days. So, here's my review, following my first 20 hours of play.THE STORY LINEI am not too far in the game at the time I'm writing this and revealing the plot wouldn't be a good thing to do anyway. But, it's probably safe to say that at least the main plot line is 'you' waking up in a doctor office after being shot in the head and then trying to understand 'why' it happen and 'who' did it or had it done to you and possibly bringing some well-deserved justice to the perpetrators - sounds familiar? It probably does. The stage is the same Fallout 3-like, post-apocalyptic world, only you wake up in a desert town not far from New Vegas and you need to find your way and your place in this world while making sure that you are eaten up or poisoned to death by the local fauna or robbed and dismembered by any of the roving gangs. Oh and, there's Vegas or New Vegas rather so... gambling anyone?GAMEPLAYNew Vegas is a strictly one-player, off-line experience. It's just you and your game-issued companions (no more than one human and one non-human at any given time) versus 'the world'.You can peacefully interact with humans and robots by picking one of the several pre-written lines while they talk back to you via spoken words (subtitles available at the bottom of the screen). When you fight you can do it either in real time or through the V.A.T.S system that stops the time and lets you pick which body parts of which enemy you are going to try to hit. The view is either 'first person', suitable when traveling fighting with long range weapons or 'third person' which I personally prefer when doing real-time melees.The games consists in a series of quests that usually involve finding someone or something and then perform some action: retrieve an item or information, fight or perhaps make an alliance. At any time you can abandon your quest and pick up a new one if available or you can simply roam the land and do things that would help you uplevel and therefore improve your skills. Killing people or non-humans, discovering new locations, unlocking safes or terminals or persuading others to do things for you would grant you experience points. Once a certain threshold is reached you move up another level and have the ability to assign 'points' to your various skills and pick one of the available 'perks'.As I mentioned before, doing 'bad' things to other people, like launching unprovoked attacks or stealing will damage your general reputation (karma) and also the way you are viewed by the faction whose member you victimized. Of course, if you go for the platinum trophy, you will have to do quite a bit of pick pocketing and other unethical things.And, speaking of trophies, the game can be played at several levels of difficulty, ranging from 'very easy' to 'very hard' and than there is the 'hardcore mode' which is hellishly hard. And you can only win the platinum if you play the game in 'hardcore' mode from the beginning until the end. If you are not after the platinum, you can switch difficulty levels at any time during gameplay.BUGS AND OTHER SHORTCOMINGSI haven't encountered A LOT OF 'serious' bugs but I did get myself stabbed while inside an abandoned bus by someone outside the bus and was able to slash the aggressor back and I did enjoy killing Geckos who, while trying to run away from me ran into a boulder and instead of going around it put themselves into a loop, trying to go through it. And the side of a Death Claw flying high... priceless.More serious, on a couple of my level-ups I was not given the opportunity to pick a new Perk. I'm not sure if this was part of the game design or it's in fact a bug. One more - and this is an update - my PS3 just froze in a very bad way for no apparent reason other than there being 7 or 8 live enemies on the screen. The crash was so bad, the PS3 button would not get me out of the game and I had to turn off the PS3 from the 'power' button. I found the PS3 to be a VERY STABLE platform that very rarely crashes. If I think of it, the last time it crashed it might have been while playing Fallout 3. This is not good.Finally, in the 'shortcomings' or serious disappointments category, not unlike its predecessor, the game tends to slow down a lot whenever there is any significant activity on the screen like... several character moving at the same time. I wish the developers took a little time to fix whatever it is that makes Bethesda PS3 games such as Oblivion, Fallout 3 and this New Vegas crawl while similarly complex games by other developers are zipping along.FALLOUT 3 vs. NEW VEGASI expected Fallout: New Vegas to be not unlike Fallout 3. However, I was surprised to see how nearly-identical to Fallout 3 this game is. Even considering the few minor improvements and additions, New Vegas could be easily confused with a Fallout 3 DLC, only a larger than usual one. New Vegas plays inside a square map that, we are told, is comparable in size with that of Fallout 3 and not larger. V.A.T.S., S.P.E.C.I.A.L., the Pip-Boy 3000, the leveling system (new Perks), the way you interact with the environment, the trash you find littered all over the place, even some of the creatures (DeathClaws, Bloatflies), the Vaults, the dirty water, the color of the desert landscape, they should all appear strangely familiar to those who've played Fallout 3 in the past.I am happy to note quite a few most welcome improvements. Game saves and loading delays are a lot shorter than in Fallout 3, making for a more immersive experience. While only 720p, the image quality appears to be improved. Human characters faces look more human in New Vegas and the lip-syncing is better. While not exactly 'bug free', this release appears to have fewer bugs than its predecessor.There are, of course, some totally new features in New Vegas. From what I read pre-release, I expected a lot more color but at least the sky is blue, most of the time. Gambling is added, including the very complicated game of Caravan (still learning it), there is some primitive potion-making capability, you get weapon mods and the ability to tinker with your ammo, there is a new interface to interact with your human and non-human companions and, of course, New Vegas comes with the much publicized local reputation - the way certain communities and factions view you based on your past interaction with them. For healing, the SuperStimpacks and the rare Doctor Bags are added.THE COLLECTOR'S EDITIONI am personally happy with the extras in the collectors box.- The \"Lucky 38 platinum chip\" - not actual platinum but quite substantial and heavy.- Half a dozen or so authentic-looking chips from the various casinos on the strip.- A deck of cards showing some New Vegas characters on it, including the infamous Mr. House.- A graphic novel covering events that took place right before the actual game begins.- A DVD with 'making of...' footage on it.Not too bad for the extra $20. I will probably keep the collectors box, sell the game which comes in the usual Blu-ray game case and replace it with the GOTY edition when released.MY SCORENew Vegas is in some ways an improvement over Fallout 3 which is good but it shows very little innovation which is a disappointment. While some bugs and shortcomings have been addressed (load/save speeds) others have not. The New Vegas' story and location may be original but the tools the game makers used to tell the story have only changed a little and, in my view, not enough. I may agree that New Vegas is a 'new game' rather than a Fallout 3 expansion but only barely so.I will grant New Vegas 3 stars (means \"It's Okay\") which may, in time, grow into a 4 stars (means \"I like it\") but this is not how I feel about it right now. As I advance deeper into the game my views may change.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fallout 3 (the New Vegas extension?)", "unixReviewTime": 1287619200, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2010"}

It keeps all of the things that made Fallout 3 awesome, fixed a lot of the things that were annoying and added a lot of things that were missing.  Some of the great things added are the use of iron sights, weapons mods, combining certain things to make meds that have different effects and the character interaction wheel.  New creatures are great.  I love that not all of them are hostile to you initially unless you tick them off by trying to harm them.  The reputation system is great and can have great benefits in certain areas.  If you loved Fallout 3 as much as I did, you will absolutely love Fallout: New Vegas!The collector's edition is mediocre though.  The hard cover comic is neat with great art inside.  The Lucky 38 chip is a little underwhelming and I wish it looked like it does in the first pictures we saw of the CE.  I really expected a heavier, chromed coin but this seems to be a cheaper tin-like coin.  The poker chips from the different casinos are very well made.  They are made exactly the same as real poker chips from real casinos are made.  Heavy and good quality.  The cards are nice too though being what they are, I wouldn't use them for actual games.  They are much better quality than the cards Rockstar had made for Red Dead Redemption.  Overall, it's a toss-up if the extra money was worth the collector's edition goodies.  Very few CE goodies are worth the extra cash.  I mean, look at the DeadRising 2 CE.  A cheap pen that looks like a syringe and a band-aid?  The Fallout 3 survival edition seemed pretty cool but the Pipboy that came with it was worthless and broke easily.  The CE for Fallout 3 was better with a bobble head and a lunchbox that looked like the ones in the game.  I wanted something like a laser pistol that made the sound effect like the one in the game.

For example Deathclaws have multiple versions, all having a slightly different look strength( don't want to spoil the creatures) I know Fallout 3 had different versions of some creatures but not to this extent.***Now i will add more to this review after i get farther in the game.

Smith \"Smithers4486\"", "helpful": [165, 172], "reviewText": "I think it's safe to say that Activision has done right by Wii gamers this generation. Time after time developers have overlooked the Wii, or simply made a crappy port of a title to say they supported the console. Activision has simply done everything they could to push the little white box that could. They've shown that with the Guitar Hero titles which really took advantage of features on the Wii that quite honestly a lot of us didn't know existed.Now here we are with the seventh installment of the Call of Duty franchise, and fortunately this is not the Wii's first rodeo when it comes to COD. We have been treated to COD 3, World at War, and even a ported version of Modern Warfare and the thing that stands out most about these titles is that they all got better. So, the question is does COD Black Ops take a step forward for Wii gamers, or does it fall flat. After spending several hours with the game on Wii I can safely say this is a must buy title for Wii owners looking for the definitive shooter on Wii!Gameplay: 95%We've already been given Goldeneye from Activision last week which gave us every control scheme possible. While Black Ops doesn't include GC support it does keep Classic Controller support as well as the superior Wiimote/Nunchuck setup that Wii gamers have come to love. If the latter is your choice of control all of the customization options expected are present, and once you have it tweaked to your liking you will be killing soldiers and Zombies alike.Graphics: 90%Let's face it. The Wii version doesn't have the visual fidelity the HD versions do, and who really expects it too. However, this game looks impressive on the Wii. Absolutely on par with Goldeneye in every respect. Obviously you will find those pesky jagged edges, but this game doesn't falter when it comes to utilizing every bit of the Wii's horsepower.Sound: 100%It's what a shooter set in a war zone should sound like. It's immersive, and intense. When you see an explosion on the battlefield you here it as well. The voice work through the entire game is superbly delivered as well, and to be honest at points the over sound quality rivals the HD versions.Story: 100%After playing Modern Warfare Reflex for Wii I thought Activision had an uphill climb for story telling in their COD series. However, Treyarc has done a fantastic job with Black Ops. Set during the Vietnam era the game begins with the attempted assasination of Fidel Castro, and you are in the role Mason who has been tasked to kill him. You will get to see President JFK which is cool and somewhat disturbing. The Presentation of the story enthralls you, and you will never find yourself being bored.Overall: 100%The sheer quality this title exuberates is unheard of for the majority of Wii titles. Normally us Wii gamers get the short end of the stick, and get stripped down versions of popular titles. However, Treyarc has poured in every thing from the HD versions (except for campaign co-op) including the popular Zombies mode. The muliplayer component is also a feat in itself due to the inclusion of 4-player co-op Zombie mode through Nintendo's WFC.

Before I begin, let me add that I am one, if not, the best on MW Reflex. I was looking for the same feel and experience, but, better. There are some very good features about MW Reflex that unfortunately are lacking in Black Ops. I only bought this for the multiplayer, and have to admit, that I almost, almost gave up. Beside the fact that the online experience seemed to be riddled with bugs from logging in to stayaing online. But, with the number of players, it didnt surprise me. I'm still not sold on the game. Sometimes, depending on the maps, I think it is a great game, then, I think it looks like crap, but, generally good, I guess. Like I said, it is mixed. In MW I really liked the \"feel\" of the guns, unfortunately, all the guns in Black Ops feel the same. Plus, in MW it really acquired some skill to be a quality player. Im uncertain as to whether this is indeed true for Black Ops. But, of course, MW was hacker andd glitcher galore.

I have not tried the multiplayer system but I usually don't because I prefer playing games for the stories rather than randomly go around killing people for hours in online multiplayer games.But I had no issues at all in the gameplay either in lagging or anything else.  There were some complaints about the cutscenes...you can skip some but not all and that's not really a reason to not buy the game.Anyway, There is a good mix of missions to keep the game fresh:  from storming Castro's villa to escaping a Russian prison to providing real-time imagery intelligence to ground forces to flying a Soviet helicopter; there is enough here to make the game fun and challenging.I was kind of baffled by the advanced weapons you use in the game, especially given most of the weapons did not exist when the game takes place.  For instance, the Steyr AUG is used in 1968 but wasn't even put into production by Steyr until 1979.  There are also many times where you come under fire from Mi-24A Hind attack helicopters in 1968 but they also did not reach operational status until the mid-late 1970s.Its not that big of a deal to the gameplay but it was odd.  I would have enjoyed using period weapons as opposed to modern weapons in a historical setting.At any rate, Black Ops is a lot of fun and worth the money.

I have played this game for all 3 systems, the PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii. I'd have to say the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions are really no different from another and superior to that of the Wii version. However the Wii version was an improvement for Nintendo's FPS reputation, likeModern Warfare Reflex. But there was still dissappointing stuff, especially with the exclusions and graphics. There is still no killcams, weapon customizations, splitscreen, chopper gunners, and dead ops arcade - something that was a big hit on the other two systems. Speaking graphicwise, the campaign graphics were a little dissapointing. Kind of like improved World at War graphics. One thing that Wii users are able to understand and what every non-Wii user must is that Nintendo doesn't have the ability to make shiny looking crap like Sony and Microsoft. All this shading and shining crap is just extra pleasure. If you were to remove those, the graphics would be the same. They also break down and lag easily on campaign when the game gets hectic, that was a huge dissapointment but the online graphics are much MUCH better, smoother and just improved. The campaign gameplay also do without the interrogation and government-file clips, but at least it was something new as opposed to the previous Call of Duty titles where they simply pinpoint a location through satellite images and then you do the mission while listening to a narrator. I also like how Sargeant Viktor Reznov and Dimitri Patrenko from World at War makes appearances on Black Ops; certainly suggesting Black Ops to be a sequal and counterpart to World at War just as Modern Warfare 2 was for Modern Warfare. Despite all the lagging and breaking down of graphics, I'd have to say that Call of Duty: Black Ops for the Wii be given a 9.0%, 0.5 less from the Xbox 360, PS3 and PC versions. I'm impressed by the way Treyarch modified the Zombie modes (I'm impressed Zombies are on the Wii version in the first place) and the way they worked hard with Nintendo to create a voice chat system, and leave the whole friend-code exchanging days behind them to create an ally-system parallel to that of the PS3 and Xbox 360's online friends system. Now you can send messages, voice chat and even use the Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro - which again, Treyarch chose to make it identical to a PS3 and Xbox 360 controller. Treyarch really did try to make the Wii version much like the Xbox 360 and PS3. Yes, that does include being able to buy maps and other extra Call of Duty content via theWii Shop Channel just as you would on the PS3 with Playstation Store, and on the Xbox 360 with Xbox Live Marketplace. Black Ops isn't like World at War on Wii where its just another crappy port, Treyarch and Nintendo really do work well together. I also noticed that Treyarch made all theCall of Duty titles for the Wii, Call of Duty 3, World at War, Modern Warfare Reflex and Black Ops. The Wager Matches were a big hit. Choosing different camos and outfits were a new addition. You even dive in this game. The storyline at least was something new as opposed to the previous Call of Duty titles where they simply pinpoint a location through satellite images and then you do the mission while listening to a narrator. Black Ops  had indeed pulled itself away from the gimmicks and styles of other Wii COD titles. Buying things is better than unlocking perks and weapons you don't want. The RC Cars are one of my most favorite kill streak rewards. Customizing kill streak rewards was also another leap that made Black Ops king of the first-person shooters. The online play is indeed addicting. This a good game for anyone looking to pull away from that Modern Warfare Reflex and World at War attitude.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Treyarch + Nintendo = BFF - GREAT GAME!", "unixReviewTime": 1289520000, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2010"}

The guys at Activision/Treyarch really push the envelope in terms of in-game features and graphics on the Wii. Most features from its 360/PS3 counterparts are present, such as Contracts, Wager Matches, and Zombie Mode, and all of the Perks, maps, weapons, and achievements are the same, as well. A few Killstreak Rewards, such as the Valkyrie Rockets, Chopper Gunner, and Gunship, are absent due to the Wii's technical limitations, but the rest of the Killstreak Rewards are included. Also, the Wii version has the same multiplayer modes as the other versions, and there are certainly a lot of them, including Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Domination, and Free-for-All (there are still others I think), as well as the new Wager Match modes such as One in the Chamber, Sticks and Stones, Gun Game, and Sharp Shooter. In Black Ops, you can earn CoD Points for the first time that will allow you to purchase all of the Perks, Killstreaks, weapons, attachments, and camouflage after you unlock them. This gives the game a more satisfying and balanced feel because you must unlock upgrades by leveling up and then buy them with CoD Points instead of simply earning then from leveling up.The graphical component of this game on the Wii is certainly a noticeable (however small) step up from its predecessor Modern Warfare: Reflex, but it still won't rival that of the 360/PS3 for obvious technical reasons. Even so, the game looks pretty. The maps are well-detailed and expansive - much more so than any other CoD game on the Wii. I often find myself getting lost amidst the intricately-designed outdoor areas and buildings of many of the levels. The map \"Jungle,\" for example, has a good deal of lush greenery, cliffs, trails, and shelters that are ideal for hiding and stealth combat. Of course there are smaller levels, such as \"Nuketown,\" that are ideal for close-combat fighting, but it's the huge, complex maps such as \"Jungle\" and \"Array\" that I find the most fun and suspenseful.As far as online connection is concerned, I've had minimal issues with the Wii version. Most often my connection is very fast and smooth. The only issue I've experienced is getting disconnected from games immediately after they begin, but this happens very sparingly (only once so far in the four days I've had the game) and seems to last only about ten minutes or so. I should also mention that apparently the Wii version has DLC and patches just as the other versions do, so you'll be able to download new maps and updates for the first time.Black Ops marks the first Wii Call of Duty game in the franchise to support online chat, too. The company PDP teamed up with Activision and Nintendo and made an excellent peripheral: the Wii Headbanger Headset. If you want to participate in online multiplayer voice chat, then this is a must-have because the game does not support Wii Speak. The headset works flawlessly; the sound is crystal-clear and does not lag or break up. Unfortunately, not too many people who are online are using this neat device yet, but hopefully more people will get one once they learn about it. It's not available on Amazon yet (it says November 18), but it's available directly through PDP's website in a limited-edition Black Ops version or in a traditional white version for $24.99. I ordered mine this way and received it quickly and with no hassle.The main selling point of the Wii version is definitely its smooth controls using the Wii Remote. The controls feel about the same and are just as customizable as those from MW:R. This is area in which I feel the \"Wii, Xbox 360, or PS3?\" question has a clear-cut answer: if you like the motion controls, then go with the Wii version. I must mention, though, that the Wii version does support the Classic Controller Pro this time around, so if you're into the shoulder triggers and thumbsticks, then there is an alternate option for you!The bottom line: Call of Duty: Black Ops is a fantastic game if you're into online multiplayer FPS games, and it's undoubtedly the best one the Wii has to offer. You'll get hundreds of hours out of this game with all of its multiplayer modes and unlockables. If you're not into Wii's controls and slightly downgraded graphics, then the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions are the clear choices for you. If you like the Wii's controls and don't mind the slight graphical difference, then I promise you that you're in for some major fun and that you won't be sorry with this game!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Hands-down the best FPS on the Wii thus far!", "unixReviewTime": 1289692800, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2010"}

If you like the Rock Band/Guitar Hero libraries then this is a definite must buy for the mass improvement from Rock Band 3/GH World Tour/5.Can you play this game with an older model controller?Yes. I have the GH: 3 controllers and is easily playable (as well as if you bought the World Tour set)What range of music is in this round?Pop, rock, metal, classic rock, emo, punk, etc. You have 'Bat Country' by Avenged Sevenfold, 'Children of the Grave' by Black Sabbath, 'I'm Not Okay' by My Chemical Romance, 'Waidmanns Heil' by Rammstein, to name a few highlights as well as Rush 2112's album.How long will it take to beat the game?You could play the bare minimum of tracks in the beginning to speed things along, but when you get halfway the game encourages you to go back and play all tracks as well as get perfect stars (i do not know what will happen after you master all tracks since I am still working on it). I would have to say over 10 or so hours to get a big dent into the game depending on how well you are.What are the difficulties?You have beginner which is strumming, easy which leans a bit to medium later on, medium which I had a hard time on near the end of the game, hard that can merge into very hard, and expert I can't even imagine how insane that could be on tracks by Megadeth (there is three total and they are the final tracks).Instead of the standard 5 stars you have each character has a story (and tracks) and special powers such as a multiplier, extended star power, or note streak bonus (such as if you missed a note with this ability it won't count against you). Later in the game you can pick what band members you want and combine their powers to maximize your score/stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Warriors of Rock", "unixReviewTime": 1359331200, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2013"}

Our first GH adventure was with World Tour and we kept up the many versions since.  GH always lagged behind RB in a few areas, mainly graphics. Well, with this release, GH finally has a very competitive product. The graphics are fabulous. The ability to customize your character has become easier - you can choose from multiple pre-selected styles (body, face, hair, clothes, etc). Or you can create your own from scratch. (But on the graphics note, I would suggest that GH improve their characters' expressions - the still look a bit too stone faced.)GH Warriors of Rock (GHWR) is much better than its predecessors. The main choices in the game are the Story (formally known as Career) or Quickplay+ (see below for other options of play).  I recommend that you start with the Story because you will earn various \"powers\" through the story that you can use in Quickplay+ to boost your scores.  In Story, you are in charge of recruiting rock warriors with various powers to release the ultimate Axe and then release the rock god from his prison by defeating the rock beast. Each rocker has it's own set of requirements for you to unlock their powers. Note that you cannot use your own created character for the story. Whatever rocker you are trying to recruit will be your character for that particular set. You have the flexibility to choose which songs you want to play in a particular set as long as you get the required number of stars (which look like suns) to release the warrior. I loved the use of Rush's 2112 for the release of the ultimate axe.  When you get to the \"boss battle\" with the beast, it gets quite difficult here, but it gets interesting. You have to choose 2 bands made up of the warriors - strategy comes into play as you decide which grouping would work best for each of 2 songs. And let me tell you, they are DIFFICULT (Megadeth is a hint).  Once you defeat the rock beast (50% of the story), you then unlock another level to the game. But here, you go back through each warrior's set list and strive to get a perfect score on each song. You have to get 400 out of 400 stars by the time you get to the rock god.GHWR's Quickplay+ enables you to pick the songs you want to play and choose which goal you want to accomplish. Based on your progress in the Story, you can choose from various \"warriors\" to increase your score (i.e. super star power, extra multipliers, etc). After you choose your goal (of which there are many and similar to those in GH5), your score will be posted and compared to other players.  You play as your created character or one of the preloaded characters.GHWR also includes the familiar Party Play option where you can just jump in and out of songs. You can also play competitively online: Pro Face-Off, Momentum (compete for highest score and your skill level is changed automatically), Momentum+ (Momentum plus ability to attack your competitors with Star Power knocking down their skill level), Streakers (get the longest streak of notes), Do or Die (outlive your opponent by hitting all notes in a section), Elimination (compete to stay alive in each section - lowest score loses), Perfectionist (compete for perfection in each section), RockFest (players vote on which game mode to compete against), Band vs. Band (face off against a competitor band for high score).GWHR includes the Rocker Creator, GH Studio, GH Jam (1-4 players pick any style of music and jam on any instrument), GH Mix 2.0 (create your own music), GH Tracks (download the latest user-created music).As one who started with GH and then preferred RB, I can say that I am very impressed with GHWR. They've turned the band game into more of a competitive \"sport\" and increased the fun component. Song selection is decent, but is weighted on the heavy/metal end (which is fine by me), and graphics blow the previous GHs away. I find that these characters actually act more like rock stars with their antics than the characters in RB.A word of caution to parents who are considering purchasing this game to play with younger children: the warrior characters may be scary to younger children (i.e. under 10)and there are more heavy/metal tunes in this one. A lot of us like to play these games with the family, but I suggest parents consider the age and maturity of younger children for the story. An example: Judy Nails turns into some sort of demonized goddess with hooves, a wing, white eyes, Joker-type mouth .... Obviously this doesn't bother me, but I could see my child having nightmares. (yes, I know the rating is T for teen)I gave this game 5 out of 5 stars....  now we wait for the RB3 release to see how it compares....", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You want competition?

I did not care much for the track list (although i now have a better appreciation of some tracks there after spending some time with it) or the new quest mode, just mainly concerned with the 2 things i mentioned earlier.

Now, the only way to import guitar hero 5 songs onto warriors of rock is to use a band hero disc to enter the code for the guitar hero 5 import and vice versa. so now i pretty much have to buy band hero again (which is thankfully cheap at the moment) for the convenience of having to put in just one disc for the whole library! support from activision has been really nonexistent, which is unacceptable considering this product was less than a year old when i made the purchase", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Guitar Hero 6.

The music here is generally heavier than the usual outing, but I am not complaining about that in the slightest.What I will complain about is the fact that, like the older games, you'll have to play through the campaign to open up some of the most intense songs in the lineup.

This may come as an unwelcome surprise to those who purchase the game and throw it in at social gatherings expecting immediate access to all content.

The new guitar is sleek.  All the electronics in the controller are built into the center, enabling the body itself to be completely interchangeable.  I doubt I'll ever personally make use of that feature, but it's neat nonetheless.  The Wii remote is inserted into a spot on the neck where the touch-pad would have been.  By the way, I'm VERY happy that Activision did away with the touch-pad.  I often found it to be cumbersome, overly sensitive and overall useless.  This new guitar also has an improved strum bar.  It's a bit smaller, it takes getting used to, but in the end it's worth it because once you get used to it, you find that it allows you to focus on the faster guitar parts that approach as the game nears its finish.  Overall, one of my favorite guitar controllers yet!Now, onto the game, and the glitch I mentioned in the title.  Essentially, Warriors of Rock is Guitar Hero 5, only the songs are better, the game is a bit tougher, and the carrer mode takes a back seat to an all-new quest mode which completely turns Guitar Hero on an axis of sorts.  Each set-list is centric to a particular genre.  For example, Johnny Napalm (the punk with a mohawk) has an all punk-rock set, which when completed \"transforms\" him.  This occurs for each of the different characters, each with a different genre of rock, such as classic rock, emo, southern rock, and glam.The game also features one whole side-quest centered around the entirety of Rush's \"2112\".  Playing it in this game truly is of a rock-godly nature.  Each part is divided by cinematic narration by Rush.  Though those sequences did absolutely nothing for me or the game, it was still cool to hear what exactly the band members intended for the narrative of 2112.  It's probably my favorite part of the game so far.However, the heavy metal is really prominent in this game, and in my opinion it's what truly matters.  Megadeth appears THREE times in this game, which of course you may know by now that Megadeth recorded a song exclusively for this game, which by judging from the song itself sounds like is gonna be a fury for whoever plays it.  Aside from that, Neversoft made darn sure the game's difficulty was kicked up a notch.  I'm an Expert mode player, but I was even finding it tough to play on Hard mode here.  I'm not complaining though, I'll complain when Activision allows a game as easy as GH5 ever again to be released.But now I'm blabbering.  Onto the glitch I meant.  I noticed during \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" by Alice Cooper that the audio totally does not play at all.  I paused it to try looking up the problem online.  I couldn't find anything, so I unpaused it.  The good news is, the audio played.  The bad news is, it was one long, irritating, repeating skip.  Oddly enough, I still got a 7-star score in the game.  Oh by the way, the scoring system is entirely different in this game.  Like, there's no score in quest mode, aside from the multiple stars you can earn in a set.Well, I feel lime playing more now.  If anyone here reads this review and you have the same problem happen to you, please comment on this review.  And if anyone else knows how I can get through to Activision to see if they're aware of this problem, please comment as well.  I'm really curious to know why it does that.So yeah, basically, what the title says.

You gave us some turn-tables and then just left us hanging!).  This review is made ignoring these lack of hardware updates, but I hope that attention is paid in the next iteration.  More instruments, and a more realistic full-band experience are the force I see driving these games ahead full-speed.However, the newest GH installment proves to be a party hit.  The quest mode adds a story-line that the series has been lacking for several iterations now.  The unlock-able characters/powers add an interesting dynamic to the game.  At first I was nervous about Rush's 2112 being a bit campy in story mode, but it ended up being a highlight.For those who have been complaining about the ease of gameplay in recent guitar hero releases, this game will give you everything you need.  Everyone I've played with agrees that this is one of the most challenging GH titles to date, particularly towards the end of the game.A direct comparison between RB3 and GH warriors is difficult at this point.  At this point I would say that in terms of hardware RB3 wins hands-down.  In terms of gameplay dynamics alone I would have to side with warriors.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best guitar hero title yet.", "unixReviewTime": 1295827200, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2011"}

That being said, there is alot to like:pretty good setlist (lots of variety), you also have the ability to play mini quickplay Warrior\" challenges with GH characters to unlock new venues, outfits and other rewards. This is new because it replaces career mode and it's a little more interesting, yet not too different a concept. During these challenges you try to earn a certain number of stars that will help the character turn into a warrior.  You unlock rewards and the ability to complete more challenges as you go along. I tend to ignore the story lines so I really don't know what they will accomplishing in the end, I just play the songs. Almost all of the songs are available in regular Quickplay anyway, which I like because you don't have to unlock them, and I get a chance to either practice them or just play them before competing in the challenges. Bottom line: The songs are fun and the graphics are decent. There are some new outfits and accessories, which is a little girly, but I like it.I have no commplaints nor have I had any game play issues or technical problems thus far. The download times are pretty quick, so I can say that is an improvement. I am finding some of the songs challening in Medium so it should keep me entertained for while, because I'll be practicing.  Love all the dlc, and new Soundgarden songs.

{"reviewerID": "AGXLOJ1GODD03", "asin": "B003N5ZXU6", "reviewerName": "M. Mazurek", "helpful": [21, 22], "reviewText": "I am a fan of music games. I have Guitar Hero World Tour, Metallica, 5, and Rock Band 2. I also bought Guitar Hero Smash Hits last year during Black Friday. I have played about 80 of the 90 something songs in Warriors of Rock, finished Quest Mode, and played online once.What's Good:-The Set List: This is entirely opinionated. If you are even considering buying this game, look up the full set list online. Personally, I think this is a great set list. It has songs I always wanted in a music game (ex. Nemesis, Burnin' for You). Beyond the songs I was excited to play from bands I either really liked (Rush, Styx, My Chemical Romance) or was at least somewhat familiar with (Queensryche, Night Ranger), the game also has songs which are funner than I expected. For instance, I originally had no expectation for Cherry Bomb, We're Not Gonna Take It, and Suffocated, but I love playing all of those songs. Overall, there are distinctly different songs which are more often than not fun to play. While there is a diverse set list, it is also more contained in the rock, alternative, metal, and punk genres (I thought GH5 was too broad).-The Difficulty: In my opinion, the main games in the Guitar Hero series have decreased in difficulty. With Warriors of Rock, they bumped it back up. Between the Megadeth songs, Slayer, DragonForce, John 5, and Steve Vai, there are some good challenging songs. Even some of the earlier songs are hard to play like Burn and Call Me the Breeze.-Importing Songs: Yes, there is a small fee to do this, but it is a thousand times better swapping discs or never playing songs again. You can import about half of the songs from WT and SH, about 80 songs from 5, and about 39 songs from Metallica. In fact, Activision waived the import fee for GH:M for the first week, so I didn't pay anything. If you have been a Guitar Hero fan for a few years, you probably have too many games on your shelve like me. When you import all of your games, your set list becomes impressive both in terms of bands and the scope of genres. The new features are updated automatically, so even the Death Magnetic album, which I got two years ago, has the new challenges found in Quickplay+. Speaking of which...-Quickplay+: Remember those challenges from GH5? Remember the leveling system from GHWT? Those are combined together in the new quickplay mode. You can keep track of how good (or how bad) you are on a song easily. You can still save playlists and sort songs like in 5.What's Not So Good/Bad:-Some songs don't belong in a Guitar Hero game. Personally, I think Bohemian Rhapsody is one of the greatest songs ever written, but it should belong in Rock Band 3 and not WOR, since it has an actual keyboard. Instead you play the piano part with a guitar. Also, I really like Seven Nation Army and Uprising, but they aren't the most exciting song to play on guitar. Instead of making them the easiest songs in the game though, they charted the bass section too [QUICK EDIT: So apparently White Strips don't have a bassist, so you are actually playing the guitar part in the game, but you can still play as a bass guitarist in the game, so the same problem still exists]. I don't care if a chart is 100% accurate and I don't mind playing some synthesizer keyboard parts in songs, but it is a little distracting in this game.-Quest Mode: I don't know why Acitivision and Neversoft hyped this at all. Quest Mode barely has a story. There are no over-the-top/epic rock moments. Instead we get bands playing at venues (just like every other game) who randomly transform into a monster. The transformations and power-ups are unnecessary, and make the game too easy. It is possible to have star power on, with a 36x multiplier for an entire song. However, you don't earn points in this mode. Instead you can earn up to 40 (yes 40) stars. The only cool moments in Quest Mode are 2112 and fighting The Beast. I doubt anybody is dying to play through Quest Mode, but just so you know, there is absolutely nothing to talk about. Personally, I would skip Quest Mode, except...-Some songs are locked: Yeah. The last tier (the hardest songs in the game) is locked, so you have to play through Quest Mode in order to play every song. I believe you have to do this to unlock 2112 as well. You will only have to endure this once, and if you are experienced at Guitar Hero or Rock Band it should only take you about 6 hours to reach the end. Still, was a little annoying I could play Black Widow of La Porte when I first got the game. Oh well.Bottom Line:If you are not bored with Guitar Hero, then you should have some fun with this game. I picked this game over Rock Band 3 because I like this set list more, there is a lot of crossover with previous Guitar Hero games (RB3 has songs from GH 1, 2, 3, WT, 5, and WOR), and I don't want to budget for completely new instruments right now. So basically I picked this game, because I thought WOR has fun songs and on that front the game has delivered.If you are just now thinking about playing a music game, pick up an earlier game (either GH5, Metallica, or RB2. I wouldn't go much earlier than that), since they are finally coming down in price.QUICK EDIT (10/17/10):Although I still believe the powers in Quest Mode don't add much to the game, I do have to admit something. In Quickplay+, you can select 2 powers out of the 8 in the game. The game doesn't save your score, so you don't have to worry about beating people who somehow got 2 million points on a song (you still see your score, but it only saves the stars you received). Overall, I think using power-ups in Quickplay+ is fun. Since you are able to pick which powers you use, it is better than Quest Mode, which either assigns random powers based on the rocker's set list, or you play with 4 or 8 powers which makes the game too easy. With that in mind, the powers still don't add anything new to the gameplay. They are simply a new gameplay mode. If anything, this only reinforces how fun Quickplay+ is.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for GH Fans, But That's About It", "unixReviewTime": 1286064000, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2010"}

Most GH games you can beat in a few hours but RB, not even close. When I first started playing GH WOR I wasnt too impressed. Ya its different but I just spent this entire year playing and beating every GH and RB game there is. I was happy to see that after playing 8-10 songs and unlocking the first character and upgrading them I only had the game 5% beat. By this time I was starting to see the differences in this new game and its pretty cool! So I played through another character and upgraded them, it now said 10% complete. I got 12 stars on one song, this game is different, I might have to play the tutorial and learn some new tricks. Each character has different abilities and is upgradable, how cool is that? Its really cool!I decided to check out the quick play and see if my massive stash of GH song on my hard drive would be there. It looks like most were if not all were there, I think it said I had 260 songs total, including all the ones from this new game. I downloaded world tour, smash hits and band hero at crazy low prices already for my GH5. Were talking the price of my morning mocha, thankyou GH :) Up until this game came out those were the only 3 GH games you could DL the songs to your hard drive so far.I was blow away when I checked to see if I could import the songs from my GH5 disc. Now for 480 microsoft points each you can add all the songs from GH5 and GH metalica if you have the code on the back of the owners manual and its never been used. This is were RB can learn from GH. RB charges 400 points to load RB1 to your HD but 800 points to load Lego RB and 800 points to load RB Greenday. Lets get the Beatles on there too RB!I was blown away again when I started playing the quick play!!! Never been impressed with any quick play on any RB or GH. On this new game you can earn like 36 stars per song and some other stuff I havent even learned yet. Thats on every song for the game and all the downloaded songs you have, that means a person could get 10,000 stars or even more. By the way the unlockable upgradable characters have cool different abilities in quick play and story mode.Ya I will be playing this game for a long time and that is no joke :) If GH can get GH2, GH3, GH Aerosmith and GH Vanhalen on here for thier very reasonable MS points price I will be set for life. Buy this game!! If you like GH you should love this one.Oh I got the Soundgarden cd too even though they stopped mentioning that it came with it months ago, I didnt think I would get it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Totally awsome!

Comments on the things you get:1.  Drum stand.  I almost always have problems putting things together and this was no exception.  Difference being that this time it was all my fault.  The instructions were very easy to follow and the only time I had a problem was when I tried to do things without looking at them.  Honestly, someone with average skills could probably put it together without instructions.  It feels quite sturdy and is level.If I had any negative comment it would be that it is a little too low for me.2.  Dongle for the drums and the guitar.  One great thing, IMO, is that the drum dongle has two USB connectors built into it so you get a free hub.3.  Microphone with a long cord.  Works much better than the crappy headset I had been using.  Still hard to get star power though.  Maybe I just don't know how to  do it right.4.  Drum sticks, pretty plain.5.  Guitar.  I think someone people seemed to think it came with the Gene Simmons axe.  The guitar that came with it is quite nice.  I especially liked it because I had a really old GH III: LOR guitar.  The new one seems to be much more responsive and quiet.  I actually beat two songs on RB3 that I had been struggling with.  Guitar comes with strap and batteries, always nice.6.  GH: WOR.  Since I already have the game I will trade in for a cool 9.707.  Drums.  It seems to me the pads are pretty quiet when you hit them correctly.  The cymbals work well for me too.  3 pads, 2 cymbals and a kick thingy.8.  Nice controller that attaches to the front of the drums. I like that it may be detached.Price if you bought this stuff separate:Game:  19.20Drums:  Somewhere around 100 bucksMicrophone: 20Guitar Hero 5 guitar: 45So you can see that you save quite a bit of money buying the bundle.  I was going to buy the Mad Catz Pro Drum set back when it was 130 but then it jumped up to over 200 so I found this one.  I am glad that I bought it because of everything it comes with and I probably would suck at the pro drums anyway.

I am writing this review as a newcomer to the genre, so I won't have the same complaints or praises as someone comparing this to the previous installments of the series or the competition.I am very impressed with this version of Guitar Hero. The story mode is completely lame, but still fun, and necessary to unlock all the songs in the game. At least it is easy, though. Ridiculously easy so far, even for me. They want you to unlock all the songs and play the game all the way through, which is a good thing because it gets you to where WoR really shines: Party Mode.Party Mode is available right from the start, but unlocking every song in the game requires a story mode playthrough. Party mode is a no-fail option where any of the 4 instruments can drop in or out at any time and you can either make your own playlist or just let it shuffle through all the songs you have in your library (including purchased or imported songs from other games).The only thing that really ticked me off about this bundle is that it came with the Guitar Hero 5 guitar and not the new Warriors of Rock Guitar. This means for someone like me, I had to work really hard to find an affordable solution to add the very cool new guitar as my second guitar.However, the instruments that do come with the bundle are great, hold up well, and yes, everything but the Mic is wireless on the PS3. The guitars and drums turn off after a few minutes of being idle, which saves the battery life.

You may have seen official reviews from certain video game review websites that did not review it properly. I will fist start off with the mistakes this official reviewer from that well known video game website. He says that party play is \"buried under a sea of menus\" when all you need to do to access party play is to press the yellow button on the guitar at the main menu. He also goes to say that the 5 star paradigm you know and love is gone\" which is also untrue. Quest mode will have you shooting for about 7 stars because of the new powers, but in quickplay+ you have the option of playing the traditional way with just earning 5 stars and not using powerups.Lets start with the gameplay, like i said the game offers a new way of playing with the new powerups, which i find fun and i will list all of them for youspeadfreak: keeps multiplier at 2x and you earn extra stars for keeping it over 3xcrowd hyper: earn extra stars for hitting notes while the rock meter is fullstar power generator: earn 5% star power for every 10 notes hitstar power amplifier: earn 2x the normal amount for hitting star power phrasesmulitplier extender: earn up to 5x multiplier instead of 4steak guardian: protects you from breaking your streak for 1 note and earn extra stars for long streaksResurrection: earn up to 2 ankhs for playing well and each ankh you earn will protect you from failingstar power nova: earn 3x for star power instead of 2x.People may not want to play this way, so in quickplay+ you can play the traditional way where you can earn up to 5 stars.The guitar has a nice design and an improvement over the previous guitar hero guitars. But it is not perfect. The strummer squeaks which can get annoying, plus sometimes the guitar will  have a period of time where it will drop notes, but not as bad as the les paul guitar. But all other previous problems have gone away, the whammy bar stays in place and feels very smooth, the star power tilt detection is fixed, previous guitar hero guitars had a problem with star power going off on its own.Now the problem with the setlist i have is that it has some good artists, but they pick mediocre songs by them.

Nash", "helpful": [2, 4], "reviewText": "While the other reviews posted so far seem to love the game, I think it's improvements are so minor that it is barely worth mentioning.Game has a lot of things I didn't like, but to be honest, the music selection biased me as I'm not a huge heavy metal fan, which means there were maybe 10 songs in the game I liked enough to enjoy playing.  I liked the other games with a bit of variety.  If you don't like one style of music you don't have to play 80 versions of it during quest mode.The game play has a few improvements over GH5, mostly the held strums on the base.  This is one area of play in Guitar Hero that I think really puts it ahead of Rock Band, but considering the upcoming keyboard and pro modes of guitar in Rock Band 3, I don't think this is going to be enough to make me even put the game back in the machine once RB3 is out.  The individual statistics available after a song are still a huge advantage, though.Graphically I was shocked to see people saying they were impressed with the \"improved\" graphics.  Compared with the 2 year old RB2 graphics, these look about 5 years behind.  Character motions are a lot worse, and the faces are absolutely horrible.  I'm a visual person, so this is a huge deal for me.The guitar that comes with it is also very disappointing.  First, to give it credit where it is deserved, the guitar looks spectacular, even without the Game Stop \"blade\" version installed.  The problem is when you go to play it.  The whammy bar just feels sluggish.  I liked the one from GH5 with the long bar where the lever gives it a lot of play for a little effort.  This one is shorter and doesn't feel as good.  Second, and something that is a major gaff on the designers part, if you make the guitar thinner, change the strap.  The end of the strap coming off the lug where it's attached digs right into my wrist whenever I try to use it.  I've tried to use it a few times but I just keep going back to the GH5 guitar.Overall I really wish I had just said skip this one.  I bought it for the guitar, but as I said that stinks, and the game itself is just the old one with songs I like less.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Only for Heavy Metal fans", "unixReviewTime": 1286064000, "reviewTime": "10 3, 2010"}

Ever since then I've been a huge guitar hero player, buying every guitar hero game since 2007. Though during the last few I started to feel that guitar hero was getting stale and was initially going to ignore this entry in the series until I saw previews of it. I've been playing this game a lot since I received it a few days ago, and I must say this is one of the best guitar hero games since the early days of 2 and 3. This focuses mainly on the guitar, sporting songs that are more challenging and more fun on the guitar than the other instruments I haven't been able to try drums since my world tour set is broken and I don't have the model 2 set. With songs like Bat Country of Avenged Sevenfold, Bloodlines by Dethklok, and Fury of the Storm by Dragonforce, this game has improved much in the fun department. The graphics are the best they've been yet, back in guitar hero 5 there seemed to be some mist clouding up the screen making everything seem fuzzy, but here everything is crystal clear, bright and vibrant and with fantastic venues heavy with heavy metal aesthetics. The highlight of the game is quest mode, narrated by Kiss frontman Gene Simmons, who does an awesome job. The story goes that you must free the Demigod of Rock from imprisonment by unlocking the hidden warrior forms of eight characters from previous guitar heroes. The story has an epic, slightly cheesy and completely over-the-top feel that perfectly fits the franchise.However, the reason I'm not five-starring this review is because of the Guitar, it works fine but after a couple hours the strum bar started incessantly squeaking and it breaks my concentration from time to time. Other than that it's probably the best design yet. They finally fixed the problem they've had since Gh3, not making the neck and body one piece. Instead the headstock is detachable as well as the sides of the body, leaving the battery slot in the neck. With the exception of the squeak I absolutely love this guitar.Final verdict. If your a fan of the original guitar heroes and looking for challenge it's a must have.

Serious Sam was in vain of other first generation FPS games like Doom, Duke Nukem, and Quake. Serious Sam infused strange humor and that's what set it apart from the more serious shooters. The HD version is just a prettied up version of the second game, and it still stands that only fans will enjoy this.There is no real story attached, but you pay as Sam who runs around shooting weird, yet interesting, foes with super powerful weapons. Weapons range from your standard array of FPS fair such as a flamethrower, rocket launcher, double revolvers, shotguns etc. The foes can be pretty funny with headless kamikazes that scream, skeleton horses, and just weird indescribable beings. On top of this the levels are pretty open and the HD graphics look nice, but it's not enough to save the ancient game play.We're so used to amazing cinematic game play that just run and gun shooters seem boring. Not only this but the weapon selection is a pain because there's no radial menu of any type or even categories. They aren't even numbered! You can never remember which weapon is what number so you trying to find the right weapon while backing away from enemies and it leads to frustrating deaths. Also, the game is plagued with the irritating hidden secrets that are nearly impossible to find. The game is also very hard unless you play on the easiest setting and your guns never feel quite powerful enough.While there is a nice variety in environments they seem static, stale, and lifeless. I would have liked to see more detail like animals running around, birds flying, and just extra stuff you see in modern games. I don't want just an old game with better graphics. Why bother unless you modernize it a little more because that's who's going to play it. People who are used to modern shooters. I really wish Serious Sam would evolve into a modern shooter because I can guarantee it would be amazing.There are a few neat things like being able to record your game, and unfortunately, no one's playing online.

There are subtitles-- which for some reason appear at the top of the screen-- but they go by so slowly that conversations can take hours. At higher resolutions, the screen tears and flickers at times; It also didn't have any choice close to my monitor's native resolution. I never was able to get the Escape key working. So, the only way for me to quit was to alt-F4 out of the program entirely.

The company's games fill a distinct niche in the gaming environment so well that too drastic a change would alienate its fanbase and as a result reduce the company's survivability. With that said, the company's trademark hack n' slash formula is present in full attire, but what FOTNS does differently is slow things down drastically which results in more heft and impact behind each punch and kick. Although some may feel that combat is too slow, even when surrounded by 20+ enemies, you'll appreciate what Koei has done here, as clearing the pack in a single crushing blow is a very satisfying feat.This slowed down style is necessary as it seems to emphasize the character's crushing power as they reel back to charge an attack and suddenly connect with a satisfying falsetto \"YAHHHHH!!!!!\" It also makes combos more gratifying and brutal, and it lends a fluid and natural flow to the pace of battle. Whereas Dynasty Warriors is fast, frenzied, and aesthetically pretty, FOTNS is fluid, calculated, and downright vicious.Despite this \"slowed\" combat, one minor but very awesome detail here is that Kenshiro can roll cancel (think CvS2) most of his attacks, which keeps the momentum alive and also greatly opens up your options when you whiff a punch, input the wrong command, or want to shorten recovery time. I found myself roll canceling almost everything in the beginning, before I learned any of the awesome combos, since it allowed me to avoid a knockdown. Other characters don't have this ability, as their fighting styles don't permit it, but once you gain their control you won't need to do it as you'll be familiar with combat and will have access to devastating combos.One thing you'll definitely want to do in FOTNS is purchase intrinsic skills, which are always active once learned and serve to increase attack power, defense, or what have you. It's a basic leveling system, to be sure, but it further emphasizes the series' pressure point system and also your character's development into a stronger fighter, which is a mighty cool integration of gameplay features and source material.Speaking of source material, if you're not familiar with the FOTNS universe, don't despair. The narrative moves the story along at a sensible and easy to understand pace, meanwhile the encyclopedia fills you in succinctly (unlike Mass Effect 2) with everything else you may want to know. Anybody complaining they can't follow the story is simply too lazy to read a few sentences, and by few I really mean a short paragraph.Just as Koei's combat systems across different series tend to be variations of the same theme the music shares similarities as well, and Koei again has done an excellent job in this department. Being a metal fan for 20+ years I was thrilled to hear chunky, speedy, thrashy, and melodic riffs wail away in the background. It's the perfect fit for the 80s vibe and general machismo of the series, and in today's age it seems rare to see such an emphasis on that one style with the exception of Guilty Gear and BlazBlue. Voice acting is excellent and present in full Japanese or English audio, and exaggerated blood splashes are always welcome when enemies explode. Little things like that go a long way in a Koei game and it's nice to see that the company knows this too and does everything it can to achieve a richer experience.I was very satisfied with FOTNS and having recently finished Trinity: Souls of Zill O'll and Warriors: Legends of Troy, and having dabbled in DW7 a bit, I can wholeheartedly say that Koei is growing remarkably well. These four titles alone, having been published in less than a single year, is truly a presage of good things to come from Koei.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A bloody and brutal variation of the DW formula.

It left me very excited in wanting to try this title out. After playing it, I think this will be my last purchase of a Dynasty Warrior-esque game for a couple of reasons.Pros:-If you're a fan of the anime or manga series, it follows the storyline pretty closely. I was honestly surprised to see they included the young characters from the messed up world,  like Bat and Lin. The translation from anime to game is perfect as well. After you perform a signature move, there's a brief pause describing the move after your character executes it, much like in the anime.-Dynasty Warriors w/ a Twist: Plays like Dynasty Warriors but has a hardcore feel to it. I don't ever remember seeing a pirate explode in my edition of DW: Empires.-You are already dead!Cons:-Boredom and Repetitiveness: After you've gotten past Chapter 6, most of the landscape begins to look like the same maze over and over. The enemies aren't any help either. If you've seen one guy with a club or axe, you bound to see 50 other clones about every 40 seconds. There are timed and sub-missions which might pop up sometimes and are quite fun. It helps you earn extras for that current mission, but even that gets old.

I love the concept. I love its likeness to the anime. I love the characters and English dub. I even love watching the heads of enemies blow up like a balloon until they go *pop*. But Stage 1 is no different than Stage 12. If you're a fan of the anime/manga, it's a great adaptation to check out. I wouldn't see why Dynasty Warrior fans wouldn't like this either.

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "For those whom haven't had a good brawler since God Hand, Fist Of The North Star Kenshiro's rage may sate a craving left unfulfilled before now. It's a bit ironic that in theory FOTNS actually inspired God-Hand but unless you've seen the 1980's anime series it doesn't really matter if the egg came before the chicken.For better and worse Ken's rage is a less slapstick and more solemn affair. Humans are trying to survive after the fallout of a nuclear war. The most powerful take from the weak and only a few virtous fighters stand between peace and outright tyranny.Kenshiro's story is common enough. He was trained in a lethal martial art but still wants to live a normal life. Ken's good intentions started out as promising. He won the fair hand of his beautiful girl friend Yuria and they rode into the sunset on his awesome motorcycle! Sadly a guy named Shin (he looks like an SNK king of fighters boss) beat the crap out of our beleaguered pal and took Ken's main squeeze. Naturally he sets out on the path of revenge and decimates anyone whom stands in his way.For those of us whom can't remember the original FOTNS canon verbatim there are a few shocking twists that are unexpected. Not much is predictable fare and Kenshiro's quest to topple his rival Shin isn't as big of a mile stone as we're lead to believe.Fighting thugs is simple enough. Kensiro can grapple them,pummel them,and even make them explode into bloody bits when he applies blue ki energy to his fists or feet. All the special moves can be assigned to the directional pad and once your gauge is full it's a literal nightmare for the opposing team!Between missions players pump \"skill points\" into purchasing additional boosts, new techniques,and upgrades on what can only be described as an rpg improvement grid in the vein of Final Fantasy. Luckily it's not too complicated to figure out and this additional layer of depth is appreciated.Main bosses and \"evil supervisors\" have a \"shield meter\" that needs to be whittled down before they can take \"real damage\". Though \"low generals\" can be exploded like their hench goons actual \"War lords\" will go down to one knee and prompt you to press the \"B\" button. Once you go into \"fatality mode\" you'll be forced to enter simple button commands 3 times before the bar at the bottom depletes. Failure isn't penalized too harshly. A boss will only regain a tiny sliver of his health if you goof up so attempting it again will not take forever. As much as I've come to hate real time events these aren't too bad.If I could only play through the game as Kenshiro annoyances such as the repetitive lower pantheon of enemies and limited tile sets for the environments would have hindered my enjoyment. However, as you keep playing you can unlock other FOTNS greats including Toki,Rei,and Raoh. Personally my favorite protagonist is Mamiya. No,she didn't fight that much in the manga but it seems Koei wanted to make her a more dominate force in the events for the game. Her bladed yo yos,throwing needles, and cross bow help to differentiate her from the more up close and personal martial artists. As a matter of fact no two characters look or play exactly the same. Koei finally did away with \"clones\"and I couldn't be happier!Chapters in \"Legends mode\" attempt the facsimile of an action adventure game. Aka they're more linear than the wide open fields in dynasty warriors and lay out segments to climb walls,crawl through pipes, beat down weakened walls, push crates, or use a ballista to mow down troops whilst blowing up a sealed gateway. None of this stuff is innovative but it is fun. Did I mention you can throw missiles at opponents or knock them out of the park with a steel rail? Manly!\"Dream Mode\" is unlocked after slaying the first prolific villain in Legends mode. It is a lot more like traditional Dynasty warriors so if that is more you're kinda bag you will not be left out in the cold. There are characters you can be in Dream Mode that only make cameos in \"Legends\". For those not familiar with DW it focuses on cutting a trail of destruction through cannon fodder until you face off with more experienced high ranking officers. As you secure certain \"check points\" you'll get more allied support in the form of swordsmen,archers, and even legendary heroes. While everyone prattles back and forth there's the realization each fraction in the conflict has believable motivations. It's impressive \"dream mode\" builds upon narrative & character growth as deeply as legends mode does despite the underlying fact the scenarios are \"what if\" fan fiction from devoted FOTNS fans.To me the voice acting was serviceable. No one sounded terrible. Frankly I always found the speed metal electric guitar jams in DW to be very out of place but luckily in Kenshiro's rage Koei's musical tracks are almost perfect for a post apocalyptic setting.In the end God Hand still has more charm and challenge. However if that \"cult classic\" is on your A list FOTNS can easily come in as a close second. With multiple playable characters, a deep skill point system, and local co-op in Dream Mode it makes up for shortcomings in other venues. Koei could have made a crappy FOTNS game and it still would have sold well in Japan. Instead they crafted a flawed master piece built out of unrequited adoration for the epic saga which has inspired everything from Dragonball to Street Fighter. If you're a fan of beat em ups and fighting games this is a no brainer!Pros+ Fighting is visceral,satisfying, and hard hitting.+Multiple iconic heroes and villains to unlock (Though not always play-able in every mode)+ Story line and narrative make you care about what is going on+Plot progression is surprisingly unpredictable and compelling unless you are a FOTNS fanatic whom hasn't lost touch with the series over the years.+Good skill point improvement system+Character models are awe inspiring!+Clothing takes damage and trust me, When you're playing as Mamiya that's a beautiful thing!+Local co-op in Dream Mode which has a sub menu \"free mode\" category.+Most modes offer a few unique bells and whistles to set them apart+Koei's speed metal electric guitar solos gel splendidly with this wasteland setting.+ Surprisingly up to par voice talent+A lot of re-playability! Leveling up each character and playing through everyone's campaign could take anywhere from 30-50 hours.Cons-If you looked forward to the humor in God Hand none of that is present here. (at least not intentionally) Mamiya crawling along the ground with a camera shoved up her skirt may incite a giggle or two but the \"lunacy\" of such nuances in Ken's rage is awkward and non deliberate.-The city ruins look the same during every mission. Variety would have been welcomed.-At first the combat doesn't seem quite as \"fluid\" as it is in dynasty warriors. However, once you master certain wide arch attacks this gripe becomes moot.-Though every boss has a lot of personality and unique attack patterns the under-minions are repetitive & bland. Once you've seen one angry Mohawk adorned punker or metal claw wielding maniac you've seen em all!-Certainly some gamers will dig the real time sequential button mashing required to kill off bosses in \"Legend mode\" yet I found it to be uninspired. Does every game have to use these now? C'mon ya'll. Creativity is goldy!-Local co-op gets a big \"thumbs up\" but where art thou online multi-player Koei? Here's a tip. Henceforth put BOTH of these features in all your titles! If not, a vex will fall upon ye all! (Er, not really.

Wang \"nycmode\"", "helpful": [8, 9], "reviewText": "Previously I bought the PS3 Japanese import version of the game (which I finished several times).  I've tweaked my review below to suit the XBOX/U.S. version of the game, so I hope the comparisons help.For those of you unfamiliar with the source material - Hokuto Musou is based on the popular Japanese comic series Hokuto no Ken - better known as Fist of the North Star here in the U.S. and outside of Asia.In short, the story follows the protagonist Ken Shiro, who is a master of the fighting style of Hokuto Shin Ken, or the Northern God Fist. The game focuses on mostly the first portion of the comic series - which tracks Ken's progress in saving the woman he loves, and fighting a series of antagonists from both the Northern and Southern schools of fighting. The story takes place in an apocalyptic future, in a lawless land where Ken is seen as almost a messiah like figure out to save his girl, and eventually the world.That sets the stage for the the game - which is based on the popular Dynasty Warriors series. The game plays like a hybrid of the popular DW games, sharing the same control scheme. The game also plays like Samurai Warriors in that you can evade enemies, and also features a comprehensive story mode much like what you see in DW: Gundam.If you're a fan of DW games, you can expect the same kind of action, which is pretty much a 3rd person action game featuring swarms of enemies that you plow through, though in Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage, your primary weapon of choice will definitely be your fists and legs.Between stages you can upgrade your characters (more become available as you play through the game) using skill points that you acquire over the course of the game (commonly found by breaking all sorts of boxes or vending machines scattered throughout the land). Again, if you played DW before, this will all be nothing new to you. However, if you haven't tried DW before, be warned, this is a pure action game featuring lots of fighting, kicking, pretty cgi story elements in between (assuming you can read japanese - if not, there are plenty of websites that can offer you a nice primer on the story in English).In terms of gameplay, it is relatively one dimensional. You fight (a lot) and you eventually learn special moves that you can dish out once your energy or musou meter is full. The moves are faithful to the comic series, and features a lot of pretty bone crushing finishing moves that will make anybody cringe (or laugh, depending on your sense of humor). After fighting waves of battles, you encounter bosses (each from the comic series). Most of them are easy to dispatch, though usually you have to break through a cheap extra defense meter before really doing any damage to them. But overall, aside from a few opportunities to counter attacks (especially if you're using the Southern Cross/Nanto Shin Ken playable characters like Shin or Rei), this game is mostly button mashing your way to the end.There is a wide range of customization options and you can select all sorts of finishing moves.  At the end of boss battles, you also \"finish them off\" by using a series of Shenmue like button combinations.  But for me I often find I gravitate towards one or two cool moves that I liked personally and I use those over and over again.  But that's just me.Compared to other DW games, FOTNS:KR does handle a bit sluggishly. It is understood that the creators wanted to be more faithful to the comic series, which focused more on heavy attacks and bone crunching martial arts moves, rather than the speedy weapon based style of play seen in Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors games. Therefore, don't expect to use a huge sword to slice through 20 guys at once like you see in other DW or SW games. Rather, plan on a lot of punching and kicking your way through individual enemies over and over again. For some, this slower pace may be a turnoff for DW vets. For me I didn't mind since I am a fan of the comic and it does somewhat feel faithful to the series. However, it is important to keep this major distinction in mind before you commit to buying the game.Nonetheless the game is still very fun to play and the graphics are quite impressive. The character models are faithfully recreated and the moves of each avatar are very unique to their individual fighting style. Only gripe I have about the visuals is the extremely repetitive nature of the backgrounds. Barring a few story specific areas (such as Shin's ruined city stage early on, or Souther's pyramid stage later in the game), most of the game features the same bland, Fallout-esque feel. Though it does reflect the setting of the story, it would have been nice to vary it up somewhat, or at least change some of the color palate so that it's not always the same beige washed out world that I'm fighting through.Another issue to note above is that while the XBOX version of the game is identical to the PS3 version - the graphic quality of the former is noticeably weaker than the latter.  The backgrounds on the XBOX game feel even more washed out and the character detail on the XBOX version definitely seems less crisp and clear than the PS3 version.  Otherwise, the U.S. version of the game plays and feels identical to its Japanese counterpart.Aside from those gripes, the game plays very well and is quite fun. It's a great pick-up-and-play game, and for those of you who can read Japanese, it also features other nice features such as a great story primer and character bios. Aside from the story (or Legendary) mode, you can also open up other modes such as the Dream Mode (which is like a mini-story mode for each playable character that you eventually open up that sort of elaborates more on their side stories).  Overall there's quite a bit of replay value here.Last but not least, the music is decent, but not remarkable. Kind of the generic J-rock that you hear in the background of previous DW and SW games. However, the sound of punches, kicks and screaming (and LOTS of blood splattering - this is a very violent game, though you can adjust the blood settings in the options menu - between EXTREME and MILD) will surely tune out the generic music over time.  Besides one thing I also noticed about this game is that unlike Dynasty Warriors where often you feel like you're slicing through waves of people like butter, in FOTNS: KR, it really seems like you're kicking some serious butt.I TOTALLY recommend this game for people who love the Hokuto no Ken/Fist of the North Star comic series. Even if you're not familiar with the series, I suggest you pick up the game because FOTNS is one of the most well-told manga series out there.  This game really does a good job of summarizing the highlights of the first (and best half) of the FOTNS comic series (from Ken's revenge with Shin up to his final confrontation with his brother, Raoh) and newbies will enjoy the nice storyline.  I'd venture to bet it might motivate some to even read the series as well!For those who like DW and SW, it's also definitely worth picking up as well. Just keep in mind the somewhat different pace of this game versus the other ones in the musou/DW/SW series.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Fine Game ...

FOTNS Ken's Rage is definitely an exception to that problem with most shows/movies turned into games.

My only complaint so far and the reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the camera can be a pain at times and the repetitive nature of these types of games can turn some people off. It has a couple of different modes, legend mode is the story mode and I have to say it follows the story really well, the stages are more linear than Dynasty Warriors which are usually more open battle fields with both enemy and ally units running around fighting, in legend mode its pretty much just you against a ton of bad guys and let me just say the game isn't easy, in Dynasty Warriors normal enemies just walk around and wait for you to kill them but in FOTNS regular enemies will attack and do attack and are very capable of kicking the crap out of you, last night I taunted a group of enemies which enrages them and causes them to attack like a pack of wild dogs, needless to say i'm not sure why anyone would want to do that and I will never do it again as I found myself dead in a matter of seconds.I've heard some reviewers complain about boss fights being hard and cheap but so far I have found them to be a good challenge but fun. You don't gain levels in FOTNS like you do in the dynasty warriors games either, instead of leveling up you gain skill points in levels by killing guys and completing objectives and then you can use them on a kind of Final Fantasy sphere grid to unlock new abilities and upgrade your health, attack power, defense, ect. I really like it, I feel like I have more controll over how I want my character to develop. The other mode I tried out last night is dream mode which is kind of a what if game mode, it is stories that aren't from the original FOTNS story and this mode plays like Dynasty Warriors, huge battle fields with both enemies and ally's and your goal is to conquer all of the enemy bases, I quickly found out that this mode is better suited to be played when you have leveled you character up significantly because I got trashed and came no where near beating the first chapter.So i'm really enjoying the game, it is different than Dynasty Warriors in many ways and similar in others, the story and characters you play as are obviously far more interesting than anything in DW and you have some pretty flashy/brutal attacks that I have yet to get tired of unleashing on the bad guys and with so many super disapointingly short games coming out recently, i'm looking at you Vanquish, Force Unleashed 2 and 007 Blood Stone it's nice to get a game that you can sink a good 50 hrs into. So if you are into the genre or love FOTNS picking this up is a no brainer, it has been easily worth my 60 bucks so far.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "ATATATATATAT!!!!

The best ones that have come to America were renamed and altered. Last Battle for the Sega Genesis and Black Belt for the SMS are secretly Fist of the North Star games. The other games on the NES and Gameboy that remained FotNS in America were genuinely bad. So when I say, \"Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage is the best FotNS game I've played\", that doesn't mean its good just better than what came before.Ken's Rage is merely a Koei Dynasty Warriors staple featuring Fist of the North Star characters. The result is not-so-great and easily the worst Dynasty Warriors knockoff for a few reasons. Namely your character, doesn't matter who you play as, is slow. The area layouts are labyrinth in nature and have a tendancy to be long. Combined this with the absence of a horse or a motorbike and the game drags. Stages take quite a while to beat especially if you have a low level guy. On average finishing a chapter takes, no joke, about an hour. Another unfortunate aspect is some of the characters have weak move sets. Ken, the game's title character, the character you play the most as, has the worst move set of them all. Being a Dynasty Warriors clone, this game involves a lot of fighting off mobs of generic goons while Ken is mostly powerful focused attacks meant for one on ones with tough enemies. The best Ken has against mobs is one basic crowd clearing dial-a-combo and an overpowered special move requiring 3 energy pips you won't have access to until way late in the game. True to fashion, Koei made a basic story mode and tried to add variety with a dream mode. The story mode follows the actual plot of the manga having you play as the lead characters experiencing their most famous battles. The dream mode are alternate made up stories that serve as an excuse to play as some of the other characters. Dream mode even plays a little differently, almost like an Empire mode having you take over enemy bases. But, again, being a Dynasty Warriors knockoff, it doesn't matter who you play as the game still feels the same trying to figure out the best dial-a-combo to wipe out the most number of enemies as you make your way to the target general you have to defeat.Up to this point I've been comparing this game to Dynasty Warriors. Is there anything that sets this game apart from Dynasty Warriors? No. Not really. Same exact features and mechanics are there but have been modified to suit the Fist of the North Star universe but not enough to escape that generic redundant mindless button mashing Dynasty Warriors feel.The best thing Ken's Rage has going for it are the graphics. The character models look really good and they animate really well. The best looking in any Dynasty Warriors game I've seen. Boss finishing moves are a visual treat and yes the game is somewhat faithful to the violent nature of the manga. Ken and his brothers punch bad people who wind up turning into bloody explosions. Some of the death animations look silly and bad, while others look disturbing (not grotesque, but weird disturbing like their heads turn into helium filled tumors and they float upwards while flapping their hands like wings before they explode) However, this is in opposition to the boring barren brown landscape or garbage dump you play the entire game through fighting the same gang of clones over and over again.So in a nutshell, game is not bad but not great. Best of the FotNS named console games I've played, but one of the worst Dynasty Warriors.But this game really has me scratching my head. I really find it strange that Fist of the North Star takes place in a broken down future dystopia. The environment is dead or dying, there's garbage everywhere, everybody is weak, sick, and starving. Except all of the bad guys are huge and have physiques like pro-wrestlers. Then the bad guy bosses are at least 10 feet tall and either even more muscled or super fat. How are they so healty and where are they getting all this food from? And with the number of the identical looking enemies you fight, where's the mission you undertake to destroy the cloning facility? For real! With all these identical looking guys running around causing problems, there should be a joke final mission available to shut it off at the source (a cloning facility) in every single Dynasty Warriors game from now on.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "best FotNS game I've played which isn't saying much.", "unixReviewTime": 1331769600, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2012"}

Kenshiro along with everyone else all look very detailed and they are well designed just like the manga. The enviroments can get bland though since most of its gray but I think the crazy fighting and the over the top blood adds a nice contrast to it.Gameplay:3d beat em ups can get scrutinized more then 2d often, the playing field is wider and with that comes more need to keep the game fresh instead of just being a retread of what a 2d one is like. FOTNS does suffer from that. You'll be doing a lot of running from A to B fighting groups of enemies sometimes even protecting helpless villagers while doing that. Controls can feel sluggesh but its to offset that your characters are strong assume. Not to say that they are broken they work and feel right but you'll find sometimes that theres a delay or slow reaction to what your pressing and what the character is doing.This usually happens when your trying to block or get up everything else is feels right. The moves in the games are devasting and you'll want to know how you can string together some of your favorite moves, the boss fights are great but they can be a bit easy once you know your favorite go to combo.The rpg system is refreshing and is always a surprise in a beat em up game, plenty of skills and stats to boost.There are two main modes you can play Legend and Dream both different and are packed with hours of gameplay and different characters to choose from. You'll want to play Legend first so you can unlock extra characters to use.Overall plenty of content if you like 3d beat em up adventures.Audio:One word AMAZING, these are some of the best rock themes I've heard so far.

Lerch", "helpful": [2, 4], "reviewText": "To clarify my review title, if you are a fan of Fist of the North Star, as I am, you probably don't care that the game isn't a technical masterpiece and just want to play it. For those who are diehard fans, you would likely give it 5 stars even with the faults.FotNS: Ken's Rage is a game from Koei/Tecmo based on the same engine used for current generation Dynasty Warriors games (including DW: Gundam games). As such, the engine has some limitations and the game turns into a pretty mindless beat-em up with a decent story that is poorly translated.Yes, I said poorly translated (poorly depends on your expectations). Koei seems to like to take a lot of liberties in their English translations of games. During many of the cut scenes if you are using the Japanese dialog option, there seems to be a lot more talking than is translated on-screen. This is because Koei translates the concepts more than the words spoken. Good or bad, it is what they offer. As someone who comes from Anime translations where early days were liberal translations to today when it's a literal translation, I have to say Koei hasn't grown up in this regard, which is unfortunate for those looking for a more authentic translation. Yes, their translation works, but it could definitely be better.In a post apocalyptic world, one man stands up to the evils of the world and brings together like minded warriors to follow in his path. Along the path Ken will fight many a nameless enemy and a few main bosses, all main bosses seen in the Manga. If you like the Manga/Anime, you'll likely enjoy this game.Graphics-On the Xbox 360 the video sequences seem to be highly compressed and suffer from blockiness. I don't know how this compares to the PS3 edition.In a word, this game's graphics could be described simply as... ugly. The nameless enemies you face are nondescript, highly forgettable, poorly animated, poorly designed and poorly colored. The exploding body parts seen in the Manga/Anime are sort of captured, but man, what an UGLY mess they've made of it. The Anime handled the body explosions artistically because of television censors and it seems Koei wanted to make up for the lack of graphic nature of those explosions by trying to over do it. They succeeded in making it a bloody process, which is fine with me, but it is simply ugly. The process looks like they just distort some of the polygons that make up the characters and then cover up the ugly with a spray of blood that is copious but poorly animated.Main bosses don't fare much better. They are prettier than the mindless characters you fight, but over all the animation is stiff and ugly.Graphics get 2 stars. I struggle with this being a next generation game as it looks like a PS2 game graphically.Music-Highly forgettable tripe. Koei's soundtracks are all metal inspired but always seem to fall short of actually sounding good. There isn't one track in the game you are likely to remember and you certainly wouldn't bother trying to buy the soundtrack. If only they gave the option to use a custom soundtrack from your 360's potential store of MP3s.Music gets 2 stars at best.Dialog/Voice Acting-Not bad. English isn't bad (thinking back to Dynasty Warriors 3 when they had Koei office workers reading lines). Japanese dialog is included and you can turn on subtitles. As I stated above, Koei doesn't literally translate everything that is said which is sad because it does actually add some depth to the dialog that is lacking otherwise.4 starsGame play-This is another area the game falls horribly short on.Camera control is absolutely atrocious. In previous Dynasty Warriors games you could press a button and have the camera snap behind the character. This made it a little more palatable that you had to have so much control over the camera in the first place. If you can \"snap to\" in this game with a single button, I have yet to find it.Because of the clunky camera control, precision is severely lacking as well. If you're trying to focus on a single bad guy and attack, good luck. It takes more luck than skill to properly aim in this game.The other thing is that most of the game can be played with just two buttons. The two attack buttons (X and Y) will get major exercise while everything else takes a back seat. They tried to add depth to the game play by adding the spirit meter and the custom attacks (the ones that are called out in the Anime/Manga) but you can most likely easily finish the game without activating this ability at all if you want to.Over all-If you aren't a fan of Fist of the North Star, just avoid this game. It's poorly designed and executed and as such difficult to recommend to anyone other than a Fist fan.If you're a fan of Fist and don't mind a poorly executed game, and you can find it under $20, it is worth the price of admission, though I don't think you'll spend too much time playing it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "At sub $20, worth the price, any higher price and it isn't worth it", "unixReviewTime": 1312329600, "reviewTime": "08 3, 2011"}

Paul \"EJ\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I like the idea of putting silicone covers on my controllers' analog sticks for two reasons: first, to help improve grip; second, to help protect the rubber on the analog stick. There was once a time when controllers were relatively cheap, so wear and tear wasn't much of a concern for me, but controllers are getting pretty pricey these days.Still, I'm not too worried about replacing a controller periodically (I really do love the feel of a fresh, unused controller), but I'm quite concerned about the analog sticks on my Wii U game pad. It is currently not possible (or at least not practical) to replace the game pad, and I really do wish Nintendo had the foresight to make the analog sticks user replaceable for such an integral, heavy wear part of the console.So, I thought I'd give this product a shot. Here are my observations.First, the covers are super simple to put on. Just invert, and pop onto the analog stick. Second, they are very grippy and add a nice (but not intrusive) stickiness to the analog sticks. The fit, however, varies depending on the controller:Wii U game pad: Not a great fit, a little loose and definitely hits/rubs the base of the controller when the stick is fully tilted (but only on one side, depending on positioning of the cover). Still, it improves the grip.PS4 and PS3 controller: Excellent fit, improved grip, and doesn't hit the controller.Also, I'm not a huge fan of the &#34;frog hand&#34; design on the top. I would prefer something more symmetric (like concentric circles). I get the brand logo being on the product and all, but it makes the tactile feel of the analog stick a little uneven.Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase, but I'm hoping I can find something that fits my Wii U game pad a little better.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Super grippy, nice protection, but fit isn't quite universal.", "unixReviewTime": 1396828800, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2014"}

The DS3 sticks have a curve at the top (DS4s are flat at the top) so these covers will take that form and stay that way. So I wouldnt suggest switching the covers from a DS3 to a DS4.

When I bought Grip-iT Analog Covers I bought them primarily out of curiosity due to the positive reviews I've seen on the product page. I was not disappointed! First I covered the thumb-sticks on my Xbox 360 controller. Xbox 360 controller Thumb-Sticks are great by themselves, and mine were not damaged or anything like that. I thought I'd give it a try. To my surprise controlling the games did get better. That is due to two reasons. First the area in touch with the thumb becomes wider, which gives more leeway if you move your thumb around on the thumb stick. Second the material the grip covers are made from is a very nice textured rubber that really does give a feeling of \"good grip\". Finaly, it makes the thumb stick slightly higher than the thumb-stick without anything on. It maybe about a quarter of an inch, but it makes a big difference when you're aiming in shooter games. When the thumb stick is taller the distance you have to move the stick to make the camera or character move is greater, thus offering more precision. I was surprised when a 1/4 of an inch made a difference, but it did.I also tried the same pair of grips on my PlayStation 3 Dual Shock 3 controller. Since players always complained about the PlayStation thumb-sticks the effect is even more dramatic. DualShock3 sticks are shaped like a mushroom with the center being elevated, as opposed to Xbox controller, where the center is pushed in or concave. This causes some players, including myself, to slip their thumbs accidentally, especially in shooter games. With the Grip-It covers on, the finger does not slip anymore and the surface becomes kind of flat instead of mushroom shaped. This makes playing games on PS3 more fun.So, I highly recommend you try these Grip-It thumbstick covers. For $5 you cannot go wrong.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely Excellent Product", "unixReviewTime": 1322092800, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2011"}

It's not bad but its not great.  I rely on sound so much for gaming and I wanted to like this product but the strong bass low treble killed it for me. I think if you are going to spend 70 to 90 on an item like this you might as well go a little extra Tritton Ax pros at 150.  If you are a hardcore gamer you know Treble is key and the bass sometimes drowns out the footsteps. Tried it in Black ops with Ninja pro which even intensifies the surrounding sound to give you an idea of how much I tried this product.And even then sometimes the footstep directional sound is lost due to bass.I set the Bass on the lowest level, I used the HD 280 Sennheiser Stereo headphones. Compared this Turtle beach SSD vs my Tritton Ax pro's I have used for a year. I always run low bass so I can pick up footsteps and directional sound easier.

It definitely helps for any type of shooter, where you're more focused on playing well than appreciating the sound quality.For music, it's not so great.

In both cases I was using myBeyerdynamic MMX 300 PC Gaming Premium Digital Headset with Microphone, which is an audiophile-grade headset that can highlight even the slightest differences in the source. While the X-Fi is by far not the greatest DAC on the market, most everything I play through it sounds clean and generally very good.

The problem is this- while you can do that, the DSS will only give you Dolby Pro Logic IIx, which is certainly an improvement, but it's not the 7.1 surround sound you're really paying for. So my solution was to get an extra optical cable (so I have one plugged into each console), leave the connection ends within easy reach, and just plug whatever end of which console I want to play into the DSS (best for people whose consoles are tucked into an entertainment unit and are hard to access the backs of, like me). I plug the USB into my cable box- it can go into any USB for power, which is nice. It may be possible to plug this into some tv's and get the 7.1, but I don't know how you'd figure that out until you actually tried (I have a Sony Bravia KDL-46XBR4). Because of all this, I really would have liked the DSS to have 2 optical inputs, but there's only one. Also, Turtle Beach could have done a better job explaining that you only get Pro Logic if you plan to plug it into your tv.But once I got past all that, the 7.1 surround is very impressive, certainly the best sound I've ever had at home. I have the DSS paired withPS3 Ear Force PX21 Gaming Headsetsince it works with all systems that I know of, and am quite satisfied not counting the inconveniences I described above. Cost wise, it's a pretty affordable setup for the quality of sound you get- I paid $50 for the DSS, and $65 for the PX21's. So I'm pretty satisfied overall, but a second optical input would have made a huge difference to me, and I think Turtle Beach should have made it more clear that you can't plug into your tv and get 7.1- the 2 reasons why it doesn't get 5 stars.UPDATE: I just got theNyrius SW100 Digital Audio Optical Toslink 3 Input Selector Switch Compatible with Fiber Optic Cables, HDTV, Blu-ray DVD player, PCM, Dolby Digital, DTS, XBOX360, PS3and it seems to be working well so far with the DSS- I used the 3rd input to connect my PS2.

The main selling point was the bump up to \"7.1\" (yes I know it's not true 7.1, but I don't mind). The great thing about this product is the input on the decoder itself is both analog and optical (digital). So instead of using the red white and yellow wires that many people use, you can run the included optical cable right from your xbox and into the decoder. This gives better quality sound over the analog signal.The set has very easy to read light up indicators to let you know what kind of sound you're getting (Dolby Pro Logic or True Dolby Digital) and has adjustable \"volume in\" (which you don't need to worry about if you're using the \"optical input\"--just crank it up) it also has a \"volume out\" (again, I just crank it all the way up). It also has a bass boost on the unit.Because I use a TB headset I have volume controls and bass boost inline as well, so I can always change things without having to go to the decoder (because we all know how hard it is to get out of your seat when playing).The sound is great and I did notice a difference between running the wired headset as an analog signal without the decoder and a digital signal with the decoder.

However, Force Unleashed 2 fails to fix the problems of the original, and introduces a host of new issues.I think my main issue with this game was its length. Even playing the game on hard, with numerous restarts due to technical issues, and having to wait through the annoying, unskippable logo movies, the game still was over in just a few hours. It felt much shorter than the first game, and was not even worth the discounted [...] price. The gameplay, while still pretty fun at times, got very repetitive, simply because I tended to use the same tactic (grip object or stormtroopers, lightning, and throw) on practically every enemy in the game. The saber combat, another weak area of the first game, was not improved at all. I found myself using the same attack over and over again (slash, slash, lightning). The longer moves were easily blocked or interrupted, and I had to force myself to use them just for the sake of variety.I also experienced a number of serious technical issues, from pre-rendered cut-scenes frequently failing to play, to crashes during loading, to completely broken physics where stormtroopers would float in mid-air like it was in zero-gravity. In addition, the game is capped at 30 frames per second, making everything feel a bit choppy. These problems seriously detracted from what would already have been a mediocre game.All in all, I've found the Force Unleashed to be wholly inferior to Jedi Knight 2 and Jedi Academy. It's proof that all the fancy technologies in the world like DMM, Euphoria, and Havok can't replace solid game mechanics and a strong story.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Short, Uninspired, and Buggy", "unixReviewTime": 1288396800, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2010"}

I really like the dual light-sabers and it seems the balance of power is better than the last game. I love the combat system... however, the storyline is really a bit flimsy, the cameos were painfully short (I guess adding a character to an existing story can be a little restraining) and it seems like there could be a Force Unleashed 3 as the end could be easily built upon.The boss battles were fun the FIRST time. If you play through again, it is pretty tedious. Like the first one, you get to keep your Force Powers, costumes and saber crystals after you complete the game.All in all, I'm not upset about spending the money to buy this game. Still, the part that really tweaks me is that there is ONLY one option to go either dark or light side (at the very end of the game), the story is very linear (you follow one path and never shall ye stray), and they really don't explain terribly much. If this game were a movie, I'd give it maybe two stars. The gameplay is fairly fun, but how many games tend to borrow from games like God of War for the extreme boss battles with the titan-esque opponent and the specific button combonation finishing moves?I'd say improvements for the next one should perhaps borrow from games like \"The Suffering\" where the choices you make (like helping someone, ignoring them or killing them) decides whether or not you get a \"dark side\" or \"light side\" ending. Also, a little choice would be kind of cool. Jedi Academy at least let you pick the order you completed missions in.Not a bad game, but it left a lot of room for improvement!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fun, but ya... gotta agree with other reviews", "unixReviewTime": 1289692800, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2010"}

Givens \"There are many here among us who b...", "helpful": [9, 9], "reviewText": "Or maybe it's \"These are not the bugs you are looking for.\"  I'm not sure which. :)All joking aside, this game could have been great.  It looks like Star Wars.  It sounds like Star Wars.  But the game is buggier than an anteater's lunch.  There are graphics bugs where textures don't show up or show up \"black.\"  (A reload of the game helps this, but you shouldn't have to do this!)  Cut scenes don't play or cause the game to hang.  Saving games cause the game to hang.  There are weird physics bugs - e.g. floating storm troopers.  And talking about \"flogging a dead horse,\" as the saying goes: you can chop up dead bodies time and time again before they finally hit the ground.  Sometimes I didn't know if they were dead yet, so I just kept hacking away. :)  There are crash bugs galore, and bugs that prevent further play.  This last one is very inexcusable.  Just to a search for \"force unleashed 2 fuse bug\" for this very nasty bug which prevents advancing to the next level/stage.  I don't know how the gaming industry gets by with this!  Did anyone actually beta-test this game, or was it just shipped without anyone actually trying to play it from beginning to end?Some of the crash bugs seem to be during transitions from game play to rendered cutscenes.  One in particular made me laugh because I was so engrossed in the game: it was the last cutscene after you fight Vader.  You make an important choice, and then, as I excitedly waited to see what happened, I was greeted with an error dialog and my desktop.  :)  Fun stuff!!!  The perfect time for a crash bug!If I went to a movie and there were - for instance - scenes missing CGI effects, out of place music, color problems, or the dialog wasn't synched, I'd be exceedingly angry, demanding my money back from the cinema, but here we are, beta testing a game that shouldn't have shipped.  And this is far from uncommon.  It happens all the time.  The gaming industry needs to grow up in this regard, and consumers need to voice their opinions by not buying games like this or demanding refunds.  Customers have rights too, and it's inexcusable to ship a game that is filled with this many bugs.Another negative is this game is very short.  I'd be surprised if I played it 5 or 6 hours.  A considerable amount of that time was dealing with crash bugs and trying to find out work-arounds to the bugs.  The games shortness contributes to further, non-technical issues.With the game being so short, the plot wasn't explained well enough.  In fact, I'm not entirely sure what the plot was supposed to be.  It has something to do with Kamino and clones.  (Yeah, breaking some new ground there!!!)  It seems little thought was given to expanding the anemic storyline.The game seemed - at least to me - to suffer from some balancing issues when it came to the \"bosses.\"  They were really cool, but some of them were frustratingly hard to beat.  But maybe that's just me. :)The shortness of the game also affected character development.  You collect saber crystals (a very cool concept!) during the game which you can install in each of your two sabers to give you additional powers, adding a bit of RPG feel to the game.  Of course, you have Force points you can allocate, too, but by the end of the game, you'll have almost all of them full anyway, which kind of defeats the purpose of \"creating\" your own character.  Jedi Knight did this the best, and no SW game has topped it since.Yeah, it's clearly a console port, but in this case, it really didn't bother me.  What usually bothers me is the absolutely insane, nausea-inducing camera angles, save system, and UI limitations.  The save system is fine here.  The camera angles never created a problem.  And the controls were typical for any PC FPS.  There was some button mashing - which is weird on a PC keyboard - and combos moves that are not typical to PC gaming, but I felt that they weren't too distracting and didn't take away from the immersiveness of the game.  In fact, I thought it was much better than most console ports when it comes to controls.  At least it actually references a mouse and keyboard and didn't ask me to push gamepad buttons!!!But not all is lost - pretty close to total failure, but not entirely.  The graphics are beautiful - except for the aforementioned problems.  The level design is absolutely brilliant.  It really captures the SW universe, and this is certainly one of the high points.  Although, it would have been nice to see more inhabitants to this world other than 1) the generic rebel soldier, 2) 3 variations of storm troopers, 3) Sith/Jedi clones, 4) and droids.  Most of the races we expect in the SW world are not present, making the game seem barren and lifeless, so to speak.Another definite highlight is the variety of playing styles.  By that I mean your character is put in some situations in which you wouldn't see in the average FPS or TPS.  I don't want to give away specifics, but you are fighting in some pretty unique circumstances. Utilization of the main character's Force powers really comes into play nicely!The voice acting is top notch, and I especially like the guy that plays Starkiller.  He's acting is great, particularly in the end!!!  The music is also what you'd expect from a SW game.What's sad about this game is it clearly had the potential to be great.  It's set in the SW universe.  It has great graphics.  It has fun game play.  It has likable characters.  And even if the storyline did rehash some elements already used in SW movies, it was still enjoyable.  But the bugs, shortness (feels more like an expansion pack than a full game), and lack of story depth, relegate it to being less than what it could be.  It's worth a play, but it's not worth paying full price with your hard earned money.  It's far from the most frustrating game I've played recently, but it's a such a disappointment because the developers clearly are capable of producing a great SW game.

Some character expressions were odd - but overall it looked beautiful and flowed smoothly.  Be aware - this game is not for a low end computer.  The cut scenes need a computer with decent RAM and a good video card.Story:Although the cut scenes were beautiful and exciting - after seeing them once there isn't much draw to watch them again.  It was also painfully short.  They have a wonderful foundation for the plot and interesting characters with excellent voice actors.  But they sacrificed story for action.  Always a bad choice.Music:I was disappointed with the music.  They recycled the music from the movies.  I expected the Star Wars themes to make their appearance.  But this game has no original musical material.  Very sad - Starkiller should have his own theme.  Especially since his character has such a dark/light internal conflict.Combat:Nothing is more fun than combat with force powers and light-sabers.  There is something so fluid and graceful about Jedi combat that we are still not sick of it - decades after we first saw Obi-Wan fight Darth Vader.But the combat has too many buttons (especially on PC) - it's not accessible and it's hard to use all the powers fluidly.Batman:Arkham Asylum had combat that was accessible - and it took about one play-through to master - it made you really feel like you were as skilled as Batman.I wanted to have that same sense of empowering the gamer...feeling like you really are a Jedi fighting Vader.The combat is repetitive.  Storm Troopers die very easily and Starkiller seems overpowered at the beginning.  Upgrading force powers would be more fun if you noticed a large difference in them.  Boss battles last forever and they aren't especially difficult.  Of course that could vary depending on the player.Challenges:While the game feels easy - the extra challenges included are horribly punishing.  It's hard to even get bronze level on many of them.  This is bizarre especially considering the overall ease of the game.Conclusion:If you like light-saber combat and force powers this game will be satisfying.  Especially if you own a console.  On PC - it'll take a while to warm up to the system.

Since XSEED had some hand in the game, I was expecting a fairly good game, and found an excellent one.Ys Seven is a sort of action RPG, with combat taking place on the field, and consisting of standard attacks, dodges, skills, and special attacks. Up to three characters can be in the party at any one time, and switching between them is easy as pressing a button. This provides for extremely fast battles, although, depending upon your level, battles due require more than just simple button mashing (although at higher levels you can generally clear the field doing just this), as some enemies will guard against certain character's attacks.Experience is gained each time an enemy is defeated, as well as for each use of a skill. Each character has a base class of weapon, with additional, learnable skills attached, two equipment slots, and slot for an accessory that provides some sort of bonus. So there's a very simple skill tree within the game, for each character, although since skills cannot unlock new skills, it's a pretty skinny tree.The music is one of the first things you'll notice about the game, as it successfully fades into the background, or grabs your attention, whenever necessary.The story is fairly good. At the end of the game things are tied up rather nicely, in a rather satisfying manner.The game itself generally takes between 20 to 30 hours to complete. While it's not recorded, I ended up doing all of the optional missions, created the ultimate weapons (and armors), learned all skills, and I believe picked up most, if not all, of the various treasures, leading me to believe I had near 99% completion. This brought me up to approximately 31 hours of gameplay. There is new game plus, and if you wish to continue after defeating the final boss, you need to reload an existing save.The game is avaliable in physical and electronic formats - I purchased and played the latter, which requires approximately 450 MB of space.I give the same 5 of 5 stars, since I was able to get a pretty solid number of hours out of the game, I enjoyed almost every minute I played, and could potentially pick up the game to play it again, whether that means using my final saves or starting again (although I probably would just do the former).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fast paced game, with a good story, and excellent combat system", "unixReviewTime": 1303430400, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2011"}

Characters move very fast, (none of the sluggish, 16-bit era sprite control), and we are soon introduced to how combat will play out over the quite lengthy adventure.The camera is an automatically scrolling success, and the angle on the action is always suitable. The action itself though, is repetitive and fairly straight-forward. Very straight-forward, actually. For your party (three characters from a choice of seven or eight) are really designed to make head-on, fast attacks on the many enemies. That's right, no turn-based combat is used, rather we are destined to pound the 'X' button repeatedly until the monsters just goes away - shedding coins and materials like a confetti cannon in its death throes. Special skills assigned to each face button (in combination with the right shoulder button) will unleash character-specific arts that in themselves level-up. Some of these are pretty explosive and damaging - but they all happen so quick it's often hard to notice.The monsters themselves are varied well, and each beautifully designed and coloured location holds its own secret fauna (and flora, actually). But, once the language of the game is learned (attack, open chest, flick switch, back-track, fall down etc.), there are no surprises left for any half experienced RPG player. Satisfaction comes from clearing out an entire 'dungeon' area, but it is soon dashed once it's learned that the enemies re-spawn after even the shortest absence (yes, even leaving a screen length and returning instantly will repopulate the occupants). Sure, this is great for levelling-up your characters, but it makes battling very routine and you may find yourself dashing past the enemies to save time and preserve your interest. Well, I did anyway.Musically the title is very well done. That mystical and longing sound of JRPGs flows from the speakers with true beauty. It isn't always well matched to the environment though, and we often here anime-like quasi-jazz where understated themes may have added a little more pathos. In fact, some areas (rendered beautifully in true 3D) seem to be over-shadowed by some really complex musical arrangements. This adds to the overall 'hurried' feeling of the game play itself - whereas this player prefers to soak himself inside new locations admiring the scenery and intricacy, Ys Seven demands progress. Progress now.Boss fights are challenging and fairly common. They're the only elements that pose any real challenge. It's no Monster Hunter, but learning the bosses techniques and attack patterns is usually crucial to taking them down (where allowed). See, the game pits you against creatures that often do not die, but simply admit defeat - spewing forth unmemorable dialog post scrap. This idea that the battle was not 'real', but merely a test can really only be used once that this player can see, yet Ys Seven seems to make a living off of this naughty game-design device.Although I never emphasise most attempts at story-driven gaming (being fairly tolerant with weak writing), Ys Seven demands that I make a comment. It is neither original nor memorable in how the adventure plays out: (afflictions, resident monsters, corrupt officials, iconic items, framings, double-crosses are all standard devices). In fact, the game seems so unimaginative sometimes, I wonder if anyone on the development team had ever sat through a 16-bit era title; how banal is the term 'Dragon Power', for instance? Well, Ys Seven will throw this phrase at you consistently, so be prepared to hold the circle-button (fast-forward) if you are hoping for something more stimulating. There are many supporting characters to the story (of course, embedded in each village, with miles of explanatory dialog to chew your ear with), but again, experienced players can see where it is all going for the most part.Ys Seven shows that RPG-style gaming can indeed become a valid action-based experience. By marrying item and character management with caffeine-infused combat has proven a success for many players. It is not exactly to this player's taste, but I see that for this style of gaming, there is no better game than Ys Seven on the PSP. Just make sure you check your intellect at the town inn, because Ys Seven won't demand that your story comprehension faculties be equipped for this adventure.(`Adol the Red' - named so because of his hair, is a single letter away from `Adolf'.)(The `Romun' is a single letter away from `Roman')(`Europan' is a single letter away from `European')(The `Medo Sea' seems to be a contraction of `Mediterranean')And so on...", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A 'Ys' Purchase?", "unixReviewTime": 1314316800, "reviewTime": "08 26, 2011"}

But as I spent more time examining the unit and its features, my enthusiasm. . .well, it didn't completely disappear.  But let's just say I calmed down a bit.First, as many have pointed out, the wireless controllers are practically useless.  I couldn't get one of them to work at all.  And I had to sit very still in order for the other to maintain a connection with the console.  Pretty frustrating when you're trying to play a game.  Secondly, I did find a few games that just plain wouldn't work.  But when I tried them on the original systems (I still had the SNES and Genesis in storage), they played just fine.Still, if you don't have access to the original game consoles, this is a passable substitute IF you get the original controllers.  And since I found NES controllers used on this very site for about 6 bucks apiece, it wasn't the end of the world.

Osorio \"Raven_Knightwing\"", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewText": "ok, so before i begin this review, i would like to point out that if you're interested in getting this system or any clone systems. DO YOU RESEARCH! the reason i say that is because one these systems tend to not do the systems justice, and two its always good to hear/read other reviews to make sure what you're expecting. that begin said, lets dive into the Retron 3.right off the bat i got the Red console, because it just pops out (i own an xbox 360, ps3, and a wii). a lot of the reviews say the console's controllers are good for nothing. well except being paperweights, that's half true. i use the controller's for NES games because the NES 3rd party controller i got sucks. the sensor it uses is Infrared so that means it has to be as the same height, you don't have to be in front of the system literally but a good distance and the controllers work like a charm (the controllers don't come with batteries). also the mapping on the controller is stupid. why the A button is B and A is B just doesn't make sense but hey it works for now until i get the official controllers.the NES part of the system is something that might turn people off. the games play fine, but if you play NES games for a long time, and you remember how things look and sound. the Retron 3 sound and colors for the games are off. some colors are either too bright or dull. also the sound is off by a key, especially in Super Mario Bros 3 and Legend of Zelda is very noticeable. if this doesn't bother you then your golden for the NES part. i can't complain plus its fun to play Metriod again. i forgot to mention that the NES system does not run on S-Video so you will need to unplug that and run it on AV cables, which is no problem for me anyways.ok, the SNES part of the system is the near flawless one here. it emulates the system very well, it nearly fooled me until i saw the red console its on (see, thats why i choose the red =P). on a serious note, how you setup the sound you will notice something. one is that how distorted the sound gets, especially if its setup on your TV, sound system i haven't tried yet, but from what i heard is that its quiet in the sound system. also a big plus is that the SNES can run on S-Video, but it can still run on AV cables but it just looks better in S-Video (especially for those flat screen LCD/LED TVs). that being said, the system emulates the super nintendo very well.unfortunately i don't have any Sega Genesis games to test that part of the system but from what i've gathered from other reviews is that it runs smooth and sound and video is a little off but works well. also the Genesis part of the system only runs on S-Video which i'm sure most of you don't mind. UPDATE: the sega genesis part does work! however the sound is off and the colors as well. this is noticeable in streets of rage and sonic. the sega port does have a death grip, and is hard to pull up too because the nes and snes cartridges are big.the selling point on this system is the controller ports, you can use your original controllers and play the respective systems with the right controllers. also the knob to switch between system is very handy. the main issue is compatibility. meaning some games will not work with the system. however! some systems are made differently so you might be surprised to what can play. the games i have work perfectly:NES:Legend of ZeldaSuper Mario Bros. 3MetriodSNES:Star FoxMega Man xSuper Mario WorldDonkey Kong CountryAladdinyou can find lists on the net or on reviewers posts. i bought my games in local stores so they test them on the retron 3 to make sure it works. so there you have it. its a neat little system and very fun to relive the glory 8, 16 bit days, and affordable over the actually systems which can cost a lot. its very well worth it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nostalgia for everyone; looking for a 3-in-1? look no further.", "unixReviewTime": 1331510400, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2012"}

So here are a few tips so you don't get confused like I did and think the machine is broken right out of the box. I didn't recieve any instructions with the device so I had to learn by trial and error. No instructions not a good idea. The problem was that there was nothing to tell me that the NES games don't work with the s-video wire plugged into the unit. You have to use the standard AV cable supplied with the machine. The supplied s-video cable only works with the 2 16bit systems SNES and SEGA G. Plus you will find the games are very hard to put into the system and sound like they're gonna break. They're also hard to remove and get stuck unless you hld the machine down while removing them. You really gotta push to get them in or else it seems like they're in but they're not and the game wont work. Also there is a switch on the back that says O/J. Nothing on the packaging gave any info about this switch. So I'll tell you what it is now. The O stands for original United states games. The J stands for Japanese games from their systems. Infact you can actually play games from about 6 different systems with this one machine plus with adapters you can play other games as well. So with that being said so far I have played over 100 games using this system so it's really worth checking out.

It plays all the old games with the exception of a few that have a special chip in them.  You can simply search on Google to find a list of all the titles that this machine can't play.  Also, this system can play Japanese released games.  Just based on those 2 facts, this machine is worth the $50 or so that it costs.  Now I am going to list the problems.1.  The controllers that come with the system are TERRIBLE!  But, luckily, this system has controller inputs so you can plug in the original nes, snes, and genesis controllers.  So if you buy this system, you will need to invest in buying those controllers also.  The reproduction controllers work fine too if you are ok with cheap knockoffs.  If you prefer the feel of the real licensed controllers, then you should get those instead.  Also, the controller ports for nes and genesis are on the sides of the system which can be a bit inconvenient.2.  This system does not come with the A/V cable needed to play.  These cost about $20 or so in stores, but you can get them here on Amazon for $5 or less.  So if you don't have any extra of these cables at home, you should buy one at the same time you buy this system so you will get them both around the same time.3.  The biggest problem is that the power cord does not end in a regular plug.  It ends in a HUGE AC ADAPTER!  This thing completely screws up the balance of my power strip.  If you are interested in buying this, you probably are interested in other video game systems and other electronics.  That means that you would have a lot of cords and cables plugged into your TV.  Personally, I have a blu ray player, dvd recorder, xbox 360, Wii, PS2, N64, and a TV antenna in my entertainment center.  Always plugged in are my TV, TV antenna, blu ray player, and dvd recorded.  That leaves 1 slot open to switch out a game console.  But this AC Adapter takes up at least 2 spaces on my strip.But overall, the system works.  It plays the old games from the old systems and it doesn't cost too much.  I would recommend this system to others and I look forward to building my collection of old games.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A few flaws, but well worth the money", "unixReviewTime": 1295481600, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2011"}

The wireless controllers SUCK BIG TIME!!!! I HATED THEM!!! I have to aim these pile of trash directly at the system otherwise the system gets no reception--isn't that stupid? And i mean, THE CONTROLLER MUST, and i do mean, MUST, be at the system's level. If its on a shelve, you need to stand-up and keep the controller directly at its level, with your wrists bent forward so it aims PERFECTLY at the system's receiver. No joke, no exaggeration at all!!! Yeah. SO, the way i have my system set up is the system is on a high shelve sort of above my PlayStation, N64, etc. But i can't use this this way if i want to use wireless controllers. HOWEVER!! This system (Which, what I'm about to mention, does in fact make up for the crappy wireless controllers) has 2 controller input for each other system, 2 each. 2 nes ports, 2 sega, 2 snes. SO, i chose never to use the wireless anyways, just the OEM controllers. You know, for nostalgia, I'd rather use the original anyways. This system isn't bad, i thought it was the best of all them. (Wireless isn't a bad 'convenience', anyhow, so long as you don't need to aim it DIRECTLY at the system... I'm babbling) This was why i gave it 5 stars. I didn't care for the wireless, so i pretended that the wireless controllers weren't part of it--cuz actually, they aren't--when I purchased my first nes years ago, there weren't any wireless... so, naturally, i consider the wireless controllers as the reject of the box and excepted the system as itself alone. Good old classic value, that's what I'm talking about! Anyways, like i said, its just like any other imitation system--none of different whatsoever. The sound is odd at times, the beeps and boops are sometimes off in scale, but you don't really notice too much. Its okay. All in all, its not a bad purchase. I felt i got my money's worth. Actually, it wouldn't have been bad though if the wireless controllers worked well. I mean, other than their ability to fail on communicating to the system? Yeah, the buttons worked well, when i had it aimed at the system, everything was very good in response. the wireless handled really well as far as the buttons when, and functionality (again, excluding its ability to communicate well with the system) God, i'm bugged about this aren't I? The five stars i gave for the games it plays--it plays my games really well for an imitation system. The three? I gave the three stars for the systems overall design. the nes and sega are on the side of the system which, since the system is REALLY light weight, it could pull it forward and mess up your configuration if you have any. need space between these areas so the controllers (Sega or nes) can have room to sit in the input. I though the inputs on the side was a but ugly, but i didn't think it was bad enough to make a fuss over and give it less of a rating. Also, i don't know this for sure, but i think this system supports Japanese games too, it has a switch on the back... J and a O... i flipped it and had a genesis game inserted. I got a screen that said something about the 'J' and it says for the Sega part only anyways \"developed for use only with the NTSC genesis systems.\" Whatever this means, i don't know--i just know it says this on a black screen only when i flip that switch off from the O, and over to J, but when its at O the Genesis part works perfectly with all my games. I hope I'm not leaving out any details. Usually, when i browse Amazon or other market place i like detailed reviews so... i hope i covered everything...

Frustrated, I wanted to return this one to get a new one. Obviously the Retron 3 can play them, this one didn't. There's another $15 to ship this out.Third one comes, it works with Yoshi's Island, but the game buzzes for some reason. Dragon Warrior still didn't work, and neither did Super Mario Brothers, a game that was working fine in my last Retron 3.

The car handling represents some of the best i have ever seen in a game.  The draw distance on screen is very impressive, little pop-in.As another review said, being able to pop in any vehicle in the city nearly instantly keeps it fresh.  The game modes are solid and varied.  The online is pretty decent as well.  Took a bit to find a game, but once in, it changed from game to game varying modes.  Got this for -twenty- on amazon and its worth every nickel of that and then some.  Side note, story mode aside, just popping in and out of cars is simple enough that my 4 and 2 year old will sit there and do it and love it.  The 2 year old will tell her what car to find, fire truck, big rig, police car etc, and she will scan the city to find out to drive.The story mode has too much profanity for kids, but in this simple pop in and out, there was none that i saw.

We're talking about a driving game where you suddenly take over the body of any driver you want, in any car you want, because you're in a coma and dreaming the whole thing. When you add an open-world San Francisco setting filled with hundreds of miles of roads and the sort of eccentrics unique to the city--believe us, GameSpot is based there--you have a pretty good idea of what sort of craziness this game has in store. And now that we've seen what you can get up to in multiplayer, it somehow seems even crazier.The central mechanic in Driver: San Francisco is called &#34;shifting.&#34; Here's how it works: You tap a button to switch from your basic driving view to a much wider top-down view of the area around you, where suddenly everything is moving in extreme slow motion. It's in slow motion because you're no longer controlling that car. Instead, you're moving a cursor around the streets to select the next car you want to take over; it's sort of like jacking a car in Grand Theft Auto but without the tricky business of running around the street, yanking open a door, and shouting, &#34;I need that s*** you drive!&#34;It's a weird system, but it's one that works oddly well in an open-world driving game where sometimes you just really want to be driving a different car. There's a whole thing going on in the tongue-in-cheek single-player storyline that explains how it works and how the main character begins to deal with things when he discovers that his reality might not be so real after all. But in multiplayer, it's just plain-and-simple insanity. There are more than 10 different game modes inspired just as much by online shooters as online racers that all use the shifting mechanic in some important way.We had the chance to play a mode called Shift Tag. In this mode, one person starts out as the designated &#34;it&#34; person, and the rest of the cars try to smash their cars into him or her for one simple reason: The longer you remain &#34;it,&#34; the more points you gather. So it becomes this whole chase where the person who's &#34;it&#34; is trying to outrun the other folks, who are desperately trying to smash into this person at full speed.But here's the rub: The person who's &#34;it&#34; can't shift cars, but everyone else can. So while you're trying to flee from everyone pursuing you, you never know when suddenly a rival player might shift into an oncoming car and veer straight into your path. It's a fast and frantic game mode that breeds a sort of paranoia and tension we haven't seen in a lot of racing games. It breeds this partly because there are so many people after one target and partly because that one target has every reason to believe that every car in the city is out to get him or her.Some of the other modes we didn't get a chance to play include Capture the Flag, Cops and Robbers, and more straightforward racing contests. We enjoyed the brief amount of time we spent with Driver: San Francisco's chaotic multiplayer, but naturally, the question remains whether it's the sort of thing that will get old quickly or keep your interest for extended periods of time. We can't confidently answer that question right now, but we do know that we're eager to check out some of those other multiplayer modes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Driver: San Francisco", "unixReviewTime": 1364774400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2013"}

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "I had never played a \"Driver\" series game before, so I really didn't know what to expect going in.  The opening of this game plays like a movie, and the cutscenes are incredibly well done and detailed when focused on the main characters.  Yeah, the story gets a little loose, at times, but just the fact they built a racing game around the story is an achievement in itself.The big \"hook\" of Driver: SF is the new \"Shift\" system.  Simply put, you push X and you \"shift\" above SF, and can jump into any car you choose!  It's a neat idea, incorporated into the game and online well, but feels like a little more could have been done with it.If you're looking for a sim style type of racing game, yeah look elsewhere (Forza or GT).  One thing I will say is after play many racers on the PS3 (Midnight Club, Blur, Split/Second, TDU2), the drifting in this game seems a lot looser than all of those.  You'll fishtail a LOT if you are not careful managing your gas/brakes.  This might not faze an experienced racer, but someone who's not much of one is going to have trouble with a lot of the missions.I do like the whole \"upgrade\" system, and the game pretty much forces you to buy them as some missions cannot be completed unless you've got the ability bar upgrade, the recharging speed upgrade, etc.  You can \"free ride\" and earn WP (the game's currency) for doing pretty much anything (avoiding cars, drifting, big jumps).  So really Driver can be what you make of it.The game runs very smooth and graphically is sound.  There's no slowdown/lag that I have been able to see, online or otherwise.  That's pretty much a must achievement in a racing game.So why am I not giving this 5 stars?- For a \"T\" rated game, some of the language in this game seems a lot more fit for a M rating.  I think this game really must have skirted the line with the ESRB (For example, GTA: Vice City was rated Mature, and I would say the language is JUST as bad in this game as GTA.  Obviously, GTA got an M for the violence too...but I was shocked to hear some of the words in this game.- Online is great, yeah there's a number of levels you can upgrade to, but the only leaderboards I see revolve around some races in the city.  This seems like quite a missed opportunity.  To date Blur is one game that \"got it\" when it came to online, it's just a shame too many people missed out on it.- If you had a spare weekend, you could probably blow through the entire single player campaign.  For a full price ($60) game, that's awful short.  It took me 2 weeks to get through Blur's single player, for example.  And that was \"bare bones\".  Earning all the trophies took me a year!  So if you're not a completionist, this games ends up being a bit short.All that being said, this is a fresh, new take on racing games, and if you find this for the right price, I strongly recommend taking Driver:SF for a spin.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Driver SF:  Interesting, fresh ideas for a racing game", "unixReviewTime": 1318636800, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2011"}

For one, the game is one of the most entertaining arcade style driving games I have played since Burnout Paradise. The thing is, this game is kind of a mix between Burnout Paradise and the first 2 PS1 Driver titles. You have the story, and the different missions that you need to do (such as follow, reach the point, getting chased, and needing to wreck the opposing driver, and so on), only with a Burnout Paradise sort of style. The environment (a re-imagined sort of remake of San Francisco and some parts of neighboring Counties) is open world. While it may not be an accurate recreation of San Francisco, it is accurate enough to be familiar, and a blast to drive through. Scattered throughout the streets, are various races, and stunts that you can accept and perform for bonus cash credit. Now this cash credit is used to purchase everything from more cars (to use for various races and stunts, as well as your garage storage) to extra abilities. While you way need lots of cash credit in order to purchase things throughout the game, it is nice to know that it is very easy to earn, as you are paid for doing just about any kind of aggressive maneuver in this game.Now, the physics may not be completely realistic, which is a slight disappointment for hardcore Driver fans, the good is the fact that the physics work alongside the arcade style direction that this game decided to head in. This game is all about entertainment, and is succeeds at this admirably. Once you start to understand the game, and once you begin to understand exactly why things are the way they are, everything just seems to work, and work well. Sure, it may have a few rough spots from time to time, but honestly, you will be having such a blast playing this game that you probably won't care. The inclusion of real cars is fantastic, as you start to get a feel for how each and every car performs differently. Plus, they all sound different and distinctive, which is all great for car enthusiasts. Basically, I consider this one of those rare games, that might not win you over with movie like story presentation, and might not win you over with \"game of the year\" material, but it succeeds so well at entertaining you, and with that, you can't help but to respect it for the fact that it accomplishes exactly what all video games should do, that we all too often forget: simply being fun to play.

I logged many hours on Driver 2, and waited anxiously when I was 14 for Driver 3 to come out.  I've loved every game in this series.  Driver: Parallel Lines wasn't a bad game, but I knew once the series hit the PS3 it would be something else all together.  I recall looking online month after month to see nothing more than \"Untitled Driver PS3 Sequel\" marked everywhere I went.  By the time Driver: San Francisco was confirmed I had all but written off the series.  I figured this game would be average at best, and I had moved on.  Well,..I shouldn't have.  I've been very busy this past year with work and such and haven't had much time for \"gaming\".  But I've had some free time over this Christmas, so I went to my local GameStop and bought myself a copy.  I was iffy on it at first.  The story seemed a little out there, and the driving mechanics were off in comparison to what I was used to in other games.  But the more I played it, the more I liked it.  The story grew on me, and so did how the the cars drove.  I've been playing this game for a week straight and I have to say I love it.  The one thing that really surprises me is how many licensed cars they have in this game.  For a company like Reflections to license major car companies like Ford, Dodge, GM, Lamborghini, and Nissan, is really saying something.  I mean, I've only seen that many companies in Gran Turismo.  I still wish they had Toyota's and Ferrari's though and I wish they had the latest model Dodge Charger SRT8, and not the older model..but oh well.  It would have been sweet to fly through the streets of San Fran in a Toyota Supra or a Ferrari Maranello.  Regardless though, this game is flat out sick.  Give it a shot, adapt to the style of the game, and you won't be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Wheelman,...is Back!!", "unixReviewTime": 1325548800, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2012"}

As a rule of thumb, if I start the game by fussing around on the menus far too long, the game is crap. This is no exception.I was not expecting the full manual function of the wheel to work with the game as most games dont. However, I was rather surprised when the game did not allow for ANY manual transmission at all. The funny thing is, at the start of the game you have a manual car, but you drive it as an automatic.Another annoying thing is that this is just a menu option! There is a video online on how to use a memory cheat to make it go manual. This is literally 4 lines of C++ code that UBI did not do! W-T-F?The menus also lack options and the controller menu is confusing to say the least. They tried to differentiate keyboard, gamepad and wheel keys. However, the game is so dumb that I have to set half my steering wheel keys as a gamepad and half as a wheel. Also, sometimes the names of the menus are not positioned right (you cant see the full name, just half).Speaking of dumb, you can only define the steering controls for the keyboard. The game detects it on its own. You might think this is a good thing. However, if your steering wheel is NOT in the \"approved list\", you have no way to set the steering! This kind of sounds like a microsoft classic. It's so smart its stupid....It also does not support certain native resolutions. But in the middle of this mess, its the least of my complaints.A simple way to describe this game is: GTA San Andreas, keep the cool story, give it amazing graphics, strip the menus of everything that is useful and replace it with crap.

{"reviewerID": "A2JFKSHR0WQB8C", "asin": "B003O65TXU", "reviewerName": "QuickSilverSeven", "helpful": [37, 41], "reviewText": "Driver SF: Best Car Chase Game of All Time?Turn the key and burnout in Driver San Francisco, which captures the iconic car chase feeling like few other game before it, including the previous Drivers and classic Driver 1.THE CITY 10/10The city of San Francisco unlocks by playing missions and mini games, with the difficultly level amping up each mission to that of the classic Driver's, later in the game. The city itself is one of the most realized cities in a game today, thanks to very impressive, but maneuverable traffic counts, all at a blazing 60 frames per second. The level of detail parallels something you'd see in an arcade game; very colorful, plenty of variety and alive. Thousands of pedestrians line the streets, definitely giving the city a realistic feel, unlike some other open city games that are like ghost towns... This is comparable to Midnight Club 2 and 3's massive traffic count. The game is a hi res work of art, with blue skies, bustling streets and some of the best hills in the world for flying through the air on, then slamming back to the ground with force. It's like a roller coaster on quite a few SF hills. It's a very large game, I'd say bigger than Midnight Club LA, but not as massive as TDU2, though that game didn't have the amazing detail of DSF either. Plenty to explore for hours. There is currently not a day/night cycle. I don't think game cities get much better, and I've been playing car games since the 80's. Top variety of roads, freeways and more. Also, plenty of random cop chases going on to watch or join.VEHICLES 9/10Plenty of variety of licensed vehicles including sportcars, muscle cars, big rigs, mini cars, trucks, buses, vans, you name it but no motorcycles sadly. Absolutely impressive variety onscreen at one time. On the freeway, I count over 50 cars onscreen at once, all with high detail close up. Each has a different feel to the handling, all well done. And if you enjoyed the game 18 Wheeler from Sega, jack a tractor trailer complete with trailer, and drive or smash your way to your destination as you please.THE CONTROLS 10/10These are easily some of the most responsive controls in the car game genre. You can flick the car back and forth at lower speeds up to 111+ mph, or smooth out your turning with smooth precision. The direction you take it is up to you and your driving skills. The vehicles feel weighted with great physics known from the Reflections team, with plenty of opportunities for crashing and flipping your vehicle all about. This is classic Driver revved up to an entirely new level of intensity. The emergency brake is present, though will require the most practice to master, along with a new ram button for added power, a boost and the chance for more skillful stunts: Reverse 180's, drifting, e-brake corners, burnout circles, ramming, the list goes on. Keep in mind, this game requires skill to truly master the controls, as was true with Driver 1, with each vehicle offering a unique handling experience. Set up includes 3 default options, but no mappable button layout. The e-brake is set in stone on the circle button, turning with the left analog, gas right bumper, brake left bumper, ram and shift.SHIFT 10/10Think of shift as the ability to instantly zoom into an overhead view of the map, then warp into any vehicle you want in as much time as it takes you to see it. Shift in the next level of \"choose your own ride\". No waiting to open doors and pull people out. There is no delay, literally. See it and you can drive it. With this instant option, you can imagine what incredible gameplay thrills you can devise. As you play, it upgrades to allow a higher view of the city if you prefer. There's no on foot, but this is the next best thing, and honestly, this game shines even without on foot.SOUND 9/10Great selection of classic 70's style tunes along with some modern hits and remixes. The city atmosphere is present if you shut off the music, with honking horns and city sounds. The cars and vehicles sound pretty much like the real deals, with plenty of crisp, gurgling power and bass to their roars.OPTIONSOptions are limited, preset control choices, options for  vibration, volume of voices, music, effects and engine. Online options too, but missing the classic cop difficulty option.STORY: 8/10Featuring very impressive character models, the story takes the famous Tanner into another state of mind after being struck by Jericho, his arch enemy. In this state of an out of body experience, Tanner interacts much like a regular Driver game, but with the added ability of shift, allowing him instant teleportation as he wishes. Solid storyline overall, with a very unique take on a driving game, filled with plenty of action.CAMERA VIEWS 10/10You have an excellent close 3rd person car view, next in the cycle is one of the most useful and playable interior dash views in existence, a front hood view where you can see the hood, and lastly, a FPS view with just the road ahead of you. All views are highly playable and useful, partly thanks to the easy to flick left, right, back and front camera flick views, which allow precision looks as well with a fine touch of the right analog. A neat new feature is the zoom, where you can zoom in left, right or forward to get a closer view while driving with the left analog.EXTRA MODES 9/10There's one of the best multiplayer selection of games available in a car game, including the much hyped TAG mode. Tag mode is also available in single player, but so far, you need to jack a police car to tag the crooks scattered generously all around the city. To say Tag most is an absolute blast is an understatement. It floors the competition in terms of other open city chase games with cops and robbers.Film Director is back, with about 5 minutes to record your own footage, though the options could've been more generous with camera views. It's a big improvement over Driv3r nonetheless.CHASES 10/10There are few games that compare to DSF when it comes to capturing that Hollywood Chase, only this time, Reflections puts you right in the driver's seat as though you were actually there. Slam into the pavement from a ten foot coast off a tall hill, and you'll feel the impact as the interior shakes wildly for a brief moment, absorbing the impact. The sense of speed picks up the faster you go naturally, with an excellent sense of speed. Most importantly, the chases are challenging as you careen through the city after your target, blasting through alleyways choked with litter, busting through crowds of pedestrians, light poles and debris. As the game progresses, the chases become more clever, and there's even a mode of chases that allows you to relive famous recreations from the best car chase movies ever made. Brilliant.FINAL THOUGHTSIf you even half-liked Driver 1 or 2, give this game a green light or you'll be missing out on an absolutely classic car chase game with few equals. Highly recommended. Overall, 9/10. Don't miss it. Spread the word, Driver San Francisco should be next on your list of must-play games.

The video game map of SF is not accurate to reality. So if you were planning on moving or visiting here, and were hoping to use this game as a way to help you learn how to get around the city...Well, I'd re-think that plan. The general locations of the neighborhoods are correct, but some prominent landmarks are in totally random spots or are missing all together. I guess I can't blame Ubisoft for doing this, otherwise it'd be an entire map of parallel and perpendicular streets in a grid (with lots of 4-way stops). Would be kind of boring. I was a bit disappointed at first, but I got over it because...2. This game is extremely entertaining, packed with value. Now, It's probably weird using the word \"value\" to describe a video game. But hear me out. There are literally hundreds of missions, races, dares, activities, chases, etc. that have kept me busy for weeks. I guess I've gotten used to the standard game play lengths of a few days for video games nowadays, but it's insane how much there is to do in this game. I was disappointed after shelling out the money for this game and seeing that the map is barely like San Francisco, but I quickly changed my mind and felt I got a great deal with the entertainment factor.3. Graphics are great, the variety of cars is plentiful, online multi-player is pretty fun, and the \"Shift\" feature is a time saver and brings a creative/unique dynamic to the gameplay. Traditional racing games like Gran Turismo have more cars, more realistic tracks, and true-to-life handling of the vehicles, but those traditional games tend to be cumbersome and boring after a short while. This car game is more like Grand Theft Auto due to the storyline you play along to and the ability to travel anywhere anytime free form. So it's more entertaining to play in my opinion (see #2).Anyways, \"Driver: SF\" is totally worth the price.

And the cars...the game features an impressive array of car choices to play around with, all of them licensed.  There is literally a car here for everyone, from many different eras of automotive history.There is quite a bit of content here, too.  As suggested in the review title, the story is weird.  It's kind of quirky though, and it works with the game mechanics just fine, but right towards the end it got really crazy and kind of went off the rails for me.There are also a ton of &#34;side missions&#34; that give you some variety.  There are checkpoint races, off-road races, stunt challenges, and you'll even be challenged to reenact famous silver screen car chases from movies like Bullitt and Cannonball Run.

This makes it easier then some racers but I enjoy the relaxation of the game. Some games have you sitting up but with this one you can relax and just have fun. The new thing they did in this driver was eliminate the 3rd person part and make it totally weird and different. You are like in a coma and you have special abilities which is cool but I kind of felt like why am I doing this even though its a game.

Which is what I paid. There's a reason why this is called collectors. We're talking steelbook/metalpak casing, a USB, and a voucher for exclusive items in this version. And everyone complaining about how the USB doesn't work because your browser doesn't support it, I'll say this; I don't have a problem with keeping my browsers up-to-date, which is something that everyone should do. But hey... We can't all be satisfied, right?Onto #2: What you get is a steelbook case of Starkiller on the front, and Darth Vader on the back. The display/outer case is transparent up until the middle, so you can choose which artwork you want, which is cool in my book. You also get a USB Mimibot that looks like a cartoon-version of Starkiller (I find the design ridiculous and goofy, but I'm not gonna judge data storage devices, since the contents itself make up for it). The contents of the USB is the in-game script, and a ton of information on the game, which is neat, and yes it requires a browser to use but it isn't stored on a website. The other thing you get is the redemption code for an exclusive lightsaber setting and some additional Challenge stages.Finally, #3: You're playing as someone who is a clone of Starkiller, and you escape from Kamino. Eventually you end up aiding the rebels which result in a showdown between you and Vader. After defeating him, you can choose between a Jedi/Light ending or the Sith/Dark ending. The events of Force Unleashed series take place a few years before A New Hope, so when you play the game and complete both endings, it's obvious which ending is canonical...For now at least. After completing the game, you'll unlock an insanely difficult setting \"Unleashed\"; if you are familiar with Uncharted 1 and 2 and the \"Crushing\" difficulties as well as RE5's Professional mode, then you'll get the general idea. But if you want to talk difficult challenges, then try the Challenges you can do. They're hard yes, and some are ridiculously hard, but hey, so were some of the trials in the new Castlevania.As a final note, there is an add-on story arc which sets an alternate ending for the 6th film you can download.

There are strong pros and cons to this game and it is being met with mixed reviews because of some dramatic changes to the original formula.  Good changes, or Bad... that is really up to you to decide.Gameplay: A lot has changed, yet hasn't here.  The Force Unleashed 2 puts you as Starkiller once again, but now he is a dual wielding beast.  Despite two sabers many of his moves have not changed they simply have become stronger.  The big change here is targeting and force powers.  *Targeting is improved to a level where I didn't even have to use the lock on feature for bosses and harder foes like in the first.  *Force powers are now much more responsive to use.  Even Force Grip is streamline.  There is no need to fight with the controller anymore to get the direction you want something to go.  The mechanics work fine with the flow of the game now, in fact  to a point where starkiller feels god-like.  *Upgrading force powers is back but you start with all force abilities except Repulse and Saber throw (you earn those fairly quickly though).  However, force combos and upgrades for starkiller have been removed.  The leveling change almost made the first one feel like an RPG.  Holocrons are back but now serve as a way to upgrade your health/force bars, experience and of course unlock light saber crystals.  Crystals now have a built in power attribute(unlike the first game, which had color and power crystals).  Example, Jedi Green = health regen  White = more Exp pts earned  Blue = Force regen etcSound/Story: The sound effects are on par with the last game.  More refined but overall the same.  The story ...uh...  no comment?  Okay okay... if you are getting this game for the storyline I would suggest you pass big time.  The storyline borderlines on annoying and illogical.  I wont give it away of course, but don't expect the story to be nearly half as good as from the first game.Graphics/Presentation: The graphics are amazing.  The first game looked good but these look really polished and smooth.  Force powers have a great definition.  You can see them interact with the environment and bend through air or release shockwaves.  The presentation of the game however is lacking I think.  I even went in expecting it to be structured a little like the first, with more fluidity.  Instead the game essentially has you go to point A.. then it is 'Force Unleash' yourself to the goal and then a really stupid story element makes you go someplace else .. rinse and repeat.  There is no revisiting the same map all over again (exception of vader's base but it looks totally different compared to the first level you did there aka the tutorial)Length/Replay: Short... 5hrs maybe 6 if you decide to be a holocron hunter (it pays to find them though as you get tons of saber crystals, and health/force energy reserve).  You can easily beat this game in one sitting.  The replay value though is probably better than the first.  The game doesn't bog you down with long cut-scenes mid-map  or choke points.  Instead you go straight for the goal and hack n' slash.. blow up, mind trick etc everyone in your path.  A second playthrough using fully maxed force is just to much fun especially finding ways to blow up stuff or simply force push lv 3 a hallway and watch the entire hallway just blow apart.  There is also an added challenge mode that on 360/ps3 it syncs up with everyone else on the network and ranks you.  Earning medals unlocks experience, crystals, costumes etc.  Some of these challenges can be quite addictive.Summary of \"cons\" I have for this game (with positive re-enforcement)- Storyline was absolutely butchered in my opinion.  They should really just branch outside of the yoda, emperor, vader, luke etc  universe of star wars and explore some custom stories at this point (nothing really positive to say)- Less focus on advancement.  You basically fight your way through things simple as that.  All your combos are given to you via saber upgrades so no need to save up points for moves etc.  [makes it more relaxing to play through. Simply gain exp by destroying stuff ^_^  less focus on finding holocrons for pts to level up with]Overall Score: 81% (88% if you are a TRUE star wars fan! May the force be with you!)If you enjoyed the first you will enjoy this game especially if you showed up to own some Empire clones.

For me, I can play this game over and over just like I did with Jedi Academy**EDIT 1/22/2011Wow I just realized I never actually hit on the Collectors Edition with this review.  at Full price $79.99 the CE was definitely not worth the money.  You get a silly little USB stick that looks ugly. Never tested to see if it worked. It just was ugly, uncomfortable in your hand and would just look downright silly attached to anything (is a free USB stick though but you can get an 8GB one for what $10. This is just 2GB.  You get a special CE costume (which honestly was pointless and didn't look all that good) and a set of saber crystals which I really never had any use for as the ones in game provided me with better balance.  Overall the CE was a giant waste of money.USB Stick(20%) - Can get 4x the size for $10  and the one you buy will probably look betterSaber Crystals (35%) - adds a new color to your sabers + double damage yet not really needed as you want to use the in game crystals since they will help you regen health and force power, or incinerate enemies etcDLC challenges (60%) - Kinda sorta worth it. They are fun but for only so long.Steel Case (100%) - who doesn't love a sexy steel case design!Anyhow steel case aside, this is just a total waste of your money.  For $20 extra you can just pass and get the regular game.  The game is not bad at all.

So when I saw the worse review for this I figured people were still griping about the problems from the first game. Many said it was the weak story, and I seriously figured I would not care about the story as long as the gameplay was good. I now understand what \"The story is an instant Disconnect\" means. As the intro cinematic plays we are introduced to a Clone of Galen Marek. He is not Starkiller, he is a clone of Starkiller, trying to put his existence together based on the memories of the original Starkiller which are a side-effect of the cloning process. They try to hint throughout the game that he might be the real Starkiller, but they're never too serious about it. The one thing he \"remembers\" most intensely is \"his\" affection for Starkiller's former pilot Juno Eclipse. Vader tries to reassure him they are someone else's memories, and he needn't worry himself over them, though his affections are so intense that they end up consuming the entire game. Seriously if HE wants to spend his time wondering the galaxy after a girl and forget the Empire AND the Rebellion he needs to do that without the player, and come back when he's picked a side to fight for. That story turns this into a very generic game that doesn't have to have anything to do with Star Wars, and by the end Clone-Marek is having such a mental breakdown over Juno, while the Rebellion fails without him, that I REALLY want to wander off as another character and just leave him to emo himself to death. Again, I thought the story wouldn't matter as long as the gameplay was good but that has seriously wounded the replay for me.I also expected to like the double sabers, but it actually turns this into more of a frantic button masher. There are some very basic combos, but I was used to the old system, which wasn't on the list of things that needed to be improved. The targeting is a little better now, but not as sensitive to the throwing command (quite often I'd just let go of stuff expecting to throw it). The initial Grabbing, however, has improved; it highlights the whole object rather than just a floating a small blue or red reticle over it. Now I can actually catch TIE fighters, plus he then crushes them into a ball for more aerodynamic throwing. The new force lightning looks weird and ugly at first, it's so thick and bright. When you fully upgrade it, it looks amazing, spanning the entire room's enemies. Using it to short out those annoying Jump-trooper's jetpacks is nice, However it doesn't paralyze bigger units anymore or even do much harm which is a step back (thankfully Purge-troopers did not make it over from the first game). I also saw no need to combine the power crystals with color crystals, you have two sabers now, but in order to use the power-crystals, you have to also use the color it's attached to. And there are slight hue variations, so while one is almost pink red, another is almost orange red, very noticeable right next to each other. I'm not against having different color sabers, I just would have liked to attach the powers I wanted to the colors I wanted.FU2 didn't completely fail, they made what's here very pretty, well designed. The movies are better than the first, but are overshadowed by the terrible story. The levels are very detailed and full of color, but are overshadowed by lack of variety. There's Kamino, Cato Neimoidia, a rebel ship called \" Salvation\", and then you go back to Kamino again (oh yeah and you go to Dagobah for like 2 minutes, but there is nothing to fight, it's just for the story's sake). I played this straight through in 4  hours, but at least there was never a place where I was lost for an hour, I always knew what was next. Also very short on enemy variety, it's always imperial troops of some sort (And I hate those little terror-spider things, not fun fighting them).When you use sabers on troopers there is a bit of dismemberment now, which was missing from the first, but only the head and more often lower arms can be cut. Still it's better than just beating them with glow sticks like the first game. You will be using sabers more and more by the end, when the force power characters appear who block every force attack you have. The idea is to use the new feature \"mind trick\" on them, but I often forget I have it. There's a long boring platforming session near the end at Kamino as you are jumping around the facility, but I'll give them some credit for polishing it fairly well, it wasn't as annoying as it could have been. I found I could jump pretty quickly, it was only my fear of failing a jump that made it take so long.After the game I played the Endor DLC, which as a fan of the Empire, I liked better than the game. I have PURPOSE in the DLC, Juno is the farthest thing from Darkside Starkiller's mind. Original Trilogy Rebellion fans beware; you will not like how the DLC goes down.I also didn't like as many of the costumes in FU2, I liked the TIE flightsuit, the Darkside Starkiller, and old Sith Stalker, and the Sith Acolyte. That's it though. And in the DLC the Dark Lord's Armor, and Malek are cool, I wasn't really a fan of Jedi-Hunter, it looks like an Assassin's creed costume. Han, Ackbar, Skiff-guard Lando are ridiculous and make no sense. ALL the characters they could have given us, too many don't even use sabers or force powers. Yes, Boba Fett is awesome, but why does he have lightsabers?Overall I say at least wait until the price is around $10 before getting this. With the Collector's edition you get a bigger package, some art, a goofy apprentice flash-drive with pictures on it, 3 extra challenges, and a code for the Deak Starkiller (Ralph McQuarrie's original Luke Concept) costume and dual yellow-sabers. None of it is worth the extra money you would pay, this game is just not deep, or amazing enough to warrant the extra money.Hopefully a third game will continue from the first and we can choose to just overlook this completely.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Star Wars: Whiny Force-Sensitive Clone Unleashed", "unixReviewTime": 1315785600, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2011"}

I gave the game a 4/5 stars in regards to fun factor because I did have fun playing it.  Now the overall rating I had to give it a 3/5 stars.  The story was lacking.  The main character is after Juno, his love interest, the entire game.  Which is fine, however, there wasn't enough story or purpose outside that.  The entire game is pretty much Kota and Starkiller bickering about priorities while Starkiller destroys everything in his path towards Juno.  Gameplay, was fine in my opinion until you reached certain points in the game where there were simply too much going on.  My meaning, when there were certain scenes where a dozen enemies and Starkiller were on the same ground level or platform it became difficult to execute simple moves.  It was as if there was a lag in the gameplay, so to speak.  I mean it was so bad at times I found myself button mashing.  The last boss stage was easy to beat.  I beat the game on hard then decided to beat it on unleashed.  The button prompts were recycled which lead to the game becoming predictable.  Even more annoying, during the button prompts was the character dialogue.  It was the same 4-5 lines over and over again.  It's like the developers or whoever rushed the product or they simply got tired of making it lol.  Either way, it doesn't bode well for the franchise in my opinion.

The game is humorous and the dialogues are clever with stellar voice acting. The games are definitely not 'hard' since it's rated E for everyone, but it is fun and there are challenges here and there to keep you entertained.The games also play out quite differently, in the first game you play through different 'stages' in different 'worlds' and you don't have a health bar, so most of the time 1 touch from an enemy or 1 fall and you will go splat.The 2nd game is split to different chapters and each chapter is a pretty big stage and you complete different objectives to reach your goal. This time you have a health bar and you can play with 2 extra characters to get some variety.I haven't played the 3rd game yet but I've heard that it is the best of the trilogy and there's even more new playable characters, so I'm sure it'll be another enjoyable experience.Worthy purchase even for hardcore gamers that want to take a short break from the recent competitive gaming like myself(FPS, RTS games are becoming more like a sport than something you do to relax yourself), and definitely a must have if you are a fan of this genre.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fun experience", "unixReviewTime": 1292630400, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2010"}

Roman", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I missed out on the Sly Cooper series on the ps2 because that period in my life was my gaming hayday, and I just plain missed out because I was busy with so many others. It was a series I definitely had interest in though, and when the HD collection came out, I made sure to buy it. My daughter showed a lot of interest too, and we played through all 3 games together. She's 6 years old and had a blast playing through the games with me, and got irritated at the same parts I did (read- the third game). The bottom line is that this is a fantastic deal, getting three full fledged games for the price of one, with improved visuals, load times and plenty of trophies to boot if you're a trophy hunter.You play as Sly Cooper, a master thief, and he travels the world looking for various treasures or specific items he's after. In the first game, he's trying to collect pieces of the Thievius Raccoonus, which is a kind of family history book that also holds secrets to help him become a better thief. He'd joined by his two friends Bentley and Murray, who help whenever possible. Bentley is the brains of the operation and does all the computer hacking, while Murray drives the getaway van. The first game in the series has you playing as Sly 95% of the time, with a few levels where you get to play as Bentley and Murray. Sly's stages are of the action-platforming variety. You'll jump, sneak and attack enemies with your cane while trying to get back pages from the Thievius Raccoonus and restoring your family's name. In the second and third installments, a little more variety comes in with more levels to play as Bentley and Murray, as well as several additional characters in the third game.Playing as Sly is a blast. I loved using his special abilities like placing decoys, jumping and landing on small platforms, sneaking around ledges and even slowing down time. There are lucky horse shoes scattered around the stages, which grant you an extra hit before losing a life. Yep, this is one of those games where if you get hit once or fall off a cliff, you're out. It helps encourage the player to be more sneaky, rather than running head first into combat, swinging your cane around like a maniac. Honestly, I didn't die that many times in the first game. There are only a handful of enemies in each level, and the bosses have a pattern that you can get down pretty quickly for the most part. Level design is very good and exploring the areas to find more coins and bottles was always fun. I mean it when I say that there's nothing at all that frustrated me about the first game.The second game is where things get taken in a slightly new direction, allowing you to play as Sly's buddies. It's still fun, but the third game is where everything goes downhill big time. Here's where they add too many characters. You can argue all you want about how this \"adds more variety\", but the problem is that none of them are fun to play as. I knew I was in for a bad trip as soon as one of the stages with Murray required me to bounce around the city to get to my destination. Seriously, I mean it- you have to roll into a ball and bounce through the city. Every new area usually requires that you play as every single character at least once, to meet up with the rest of the group. A new one, who I won't say the name of as to not spoil the game, takes forever to load his special weapon and is a sitting duck until it's ready. He's a great character, and even gets a good amount of character development within the story, but my god did I hate having to load his weapon. Another new character you play as, is only used for the very small number of underwater missions and nothing else. Controls for these sections was atrocious, especially when you had to fight a boss who can kill you in 3 hits. The other two characters are used a bit more. One is Guru, a cool little koala that has taken up a life of peace and refuses to resort to violence. He gets through levels by transforming into objects so enemies don't notice him, and also by jumping onto the backs of enemies, and controlling them to go places. When controlling an enemy, they automatically take off like Road Runner and don't stop until you get off of them or they crash into something. It's a pain in the caboose, and guess what. You get to do it many times! It sucks when a cool character is given such poor gameplay. The real kicker is later on when Guru actually DOES resort to violence to an extent, and controls a giant squid, smashing enemies on a pirate ship. So much for that.What killed the game for me to the point where I refuse to play through it again though, is Penelope. She's Bentley's love interest, being a techno junkie just like him. Rather than playing as her, you get to control her RC car or helicopter. Because younger kids might be reading this, I'll use the nice term and say that the RC car handles like donkey. Every single time Penelope showed up for her levels to start, I could feel my blood boiling. My daughter would sigh loudly as well, and she initially liked the character. It's a miracle that I beat the game instead of giving up out of frustration. I came -very close- a few times, yet I managed to pull it off. The worst part is that these stages go on for much longer than they should. As for the helicopter, it'd be a lot more fun if the level it's used in wasn't so full of enemies and targets that you have to protect. I've heard that she shows up in the new Sly game, and I hope to god that something very bad happens to her.Visually, all three games look very good for being as old as they are. The visuals change from game to game, with the first one looking the most basic in terms of character models and such. There was never any slowdown, no matter how much was going on. As for the soundtrack as a whole, it's not very memorable, but definitely not bad either. There are only a couple of tracks I can remember...mostly the more jazzy ones. Voice acting is hit or miss, with Sly and Bentley's voice actors doing the best work. Murray's voice was good in the first game, and yet they got the most wooden, tough-guy voice actor they could find, probably from some 3rd string anime dub.Despite how much I hate the third game for losing focus on the main character, I highly recommend The Sly Collection. The first two games are just plain fun to play, and two of the few games I've had fun with playing the stealthy way. I got my daughter Sly 4 for Christmas, and can't wait to play it with her, and see what the new team was able to do with the ps3's hardware.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Raccoons are cool, RC cars aren't.", "unixReviewTime": 1384041600, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2013"}

Because I didn't think much of Sly 1 I didn't bother to play Sly 2 and Sly 3. When the Sly collection was announced with all the HD amenities the God of War collection received, I was thrilled at the opportunity to play the series again. I'm glad I did because Sly offers some of most interesting/entertaining platformers for the PS3.The best part about this collection is the HD graphics. The game's visuals are completely cleaned up, refined, and clear as crystals. It's amazing what anti-aliasing and 720p graphics can do to an old game, the Sly collection could be comparable to what's available on the PSN. I actually think the improved resolution and graphics update makes the collection look better than most of the downloadable PSN games available now.Sly 1: This is Sly's first adventure and it's basically a platformer. Sly is in search of his family's secret book, which was stolen by a gang of villains, with the help of his childhood friends Bently the turtle and Murray the Hippo. Players will jump, swing, hop, sneak, and attack through the whole game searching for Sly's Thievious Raccoonus book. But it's not all about Sly too, there are instances in the game where players will drag race as Murray, ride a hover craft, shoot cannons, and even play an asteroid like shooter as Bently. It's not completely balanced and varied but these minor changes to the game gives the player a breath of fresh air.Sly 2: Sly's second adventure has him traveling around the world in search of new Villains because they each have a part of Clockwerk, Sly's main nemesis from the 1st game. Sly 2 is a completely whole departure from the 1st game. Even though the game has platforming actions, it plays more like a limited sandbox than a platformer. Unlike the first game where players travel location to location, then play levels within each location, Sly 2 has the player doing everything in each location. The locations are also 3 times larger than the first and players can do whatever they want. Objectives are given within the main base and everything is streamlined within each location. Think of it as a smaller version of GTA. Besides the sandbox approach, the game is completely balanced and refined because you will be able to play as Bently and Murray. Yes your entire team is playable now, and each character has their own sets of special abilities and moves.Sly 3: Sly's third adventure has him enlisting new members to help him retrieve treasures and secrets in his family's vault. Sly 3 is pretty much a mixture of Sly 1 and 2. All the same gameplay mechanics are there, the only difference is the locations are bigger than Sly 2 and there are more varied segments. And unlike Sly 2 where most of the gameplay consists of action segments, Sly 3 has more mini game segments such as piloting air planes, controlling remote RC cars, playing with fireworks etc.As much fun as the Sly collections is it still has its fair share of problems. I've encounter audio sync issues within the game where the sound will have static noise on and off. It rarely happens but it still happens non the less. I also must be spoiled by all the Pixar and Dreamworks 3d movies because Sly's character animation is atrocious. Whenever the character speaks they jerk their head, arms, and hands after every other word. It's as if they were being animated with puppeteers like Jim Henson's Muppets. It was actually giving me a headache watching the characters interact with each other. I don't understand why all the main characters in Sly had the same voice actors except for Carmelita Fox. Her voice actor/character for Sly 1 was the best. Her character for Sly 2 is by far the worst! Not only did she loose her Latin accent, but she was portrayed as a bungling side kick always 3 steps behind everyone. Her third voice actor for Sly 3 was okay but once again not like the first. Then there's the issue of the slow down in Sly 3. It happens when there are a lot of characters on screen, not often but as much as the audio sync issue. I also found the controls for Sly 3 to be sluggish and non responsive sometimes. This could just be me, but it just didn't feel as smooth and exact as the first 2 games.I was surprised to find out the 3d option for Sly applied to all 3 games. I had originally thought it was only for Sly 3 because the PS2 version had 3d only for Sly 3. But to my detriment, the 3d option was completely worthless. It felt tacked on, its only effect was the menu screen and the conversation screen through the binoculars. It also caused a lot of aliasing with game when turned on especially with the 3d depth turned to maximum. You could get a perfect example of how bad the 3d is by watching Clash of the Titans in 3d. The Move mini games was interesting to me. Keep in mind I played everything with the controller because I don't own the move. I don't think mini game is worthless, I actually had fun playing them and I can imagine a group of friends doing so too. These type of shallow motion waggle is good for party games just like the craze that was Wii sports.All in all, I think the Sly collection is a fun and great game. For less than $10 each players can have all 3 games in the Sly collection in updated HD graphics, trophy support, and to an extent 3d gaming. It's not perfect but its still fun.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Better on PS3", "unixReviewTime": 1304812800, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2011"}

{"reviewerID": "A1Z3HUIXG76YCV", "asin": "B003O680RM", "reviewerName": "EskuchenJia", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "All three of these games were amazing!!But rather than reviewing the games individually, I'd like to review the Collection itself. So, overall, a great job tidying up the three games, but I'd like to mention a few shortcomings.First off, a trend I've seen with these game collections, they let you select which game you want in the series, but you have to quit out of the game entirely or reset your system to get back to the menu to select a different game in the series. A minor annoyance when you select a game too quickly because you assume the second option on the game select menu is Sly 2. Actually, the first option is \"Sly Collection\" and selecting the Sly Collection merely scrolls the screen over to Sly 1 which is the second option.Second, I'll bring up a slightly more important annoyance and eyesore. Noticed in Sly 2 and 3, at the end of a mission when returning to the hideout, there is a short scene of the hideout door. How is it that this 2-3 second scene was skipped over during the remastering? Sure, it's not a critical scene by any means, but this just screams \"lack of effort to me\" and it's sad to see such great games marred by such a horrible couple of seconds.Third, I've had a lot of issues with Sly 3 and I'm only on the second chapter. First, I entered an area for a mission and the area loaded with no audio. When I left the area, the screen went black and never loaded back to the main area. This happened several times, all ending in the system resetting. There were also a couple times when an area just didn't load. I ended up with the black screen (slight bit of the last screen on the bottom and top), but nothing ever loaded. Hitting the PS button and trying to quit the game only caused the system to beep and reset. Ejecting and replacing the disc also caused a reset. There was also one occasion when the audio loaded with a slight static in it. Everything played as normal, but there was just a constant static in the sound until I reset my system. I've read that some of the audio issues could be attributed to drivers, but I've checked to make sure my system is up-to-date, and I'm just not sure which is the culprit.The last issue I have with this collection are the mini-games. Lame. I just played them to earn the trophies which was extremely easy.Speaking of trophies, I'm glad the first game did not require completion of the time trials. I couldn't even pass one of them.I know I said I'd focus on the collection, but I have two negative thoughts I've had about the games as I've been playing through them: First, the skills/gadgets and their navigation/button assignment. I thought Sly 1 had the better design, but I think rather than using L1/R1 to scroll through abilities, they should have used the d-pad buttons to select skills on the fly. The button assignment in Sly 2 & 3 was a step in the wrong direction if you ask me. Second, Carmelita Fox's voice acting in Sly 3 has been absolutely horrible so far. I've only just started on the second chapter of the game though, so hopefully it gets better.Now there are numerous features that I'm not mentioning. I did not try out the PS-Move motion controls, or the 3D options. I may test out the 3D and add to this review later, but the last time I tried a game in 3D, it made me dizzy and very uncomfortable.So, overall, great games. Great job on the collection, but could have paid a little bit more attention to detail. I think about 4.5 stars is a fair overall rating here. The collection and the games were lacking in a couple areas, but overall, this is an outstanding series and a good collection to bring all three games to the PS3.**UPDATE 2013-09-02** I tested the 3D mode. It didn't seem to change the appearance of anything. There was no 'pop'.Carmelita's voice stayed horrible throughout Sly 3, but on a positive note, the game only lost audio and locked up once more as I finished out everything after chapter 2.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Games Overall, Remaster missed a few things", "unixReviewTime": 1377388800, "reviewTime": "08 25, 2013"}

If you grew up with NES, SNES, Playstation, PS2  etc  as a kid you definitely remember the Sly games and probably owned them at one point.  All 3 games were classics on the PS2 in the adventure category just like God of War 1 and 2 were classics in the action category.If you never got the chance to play the 3 sly cooper games,  or simply wish to replay them all over again in HD this is a great package.  $39.99 is a tad steep it seems for 3 PS2 era games but  you end up with 3 PS2 era \"classics\" that even on their own could topple a $60 current gen release.  Each game is fun with a nice bit of humor thrown in -  each game can take upwards of 8-12 hrs to complete also  so you are looking at 24-36hrs of gameplay hereThe Games themselves have a very unique feel to them --  You sneak around levels gathering clues, coins, avoiding traps/security systems to reach your goal.  Along the way you can crack safes and get the jump on some baddies.  The games are quite kid friendly yet just like little big planet, has enough there to keep even a veteran gamer happily glued to it; a nice mystique about it.The Mini-games are linked to the MOVE system (but I simply used a PS3 controller) and are pretty much silly.  You can tell the mini-games were just tossed in there for Sucker-Punch to test out the MOVE system before adapting it to major titles (like inFamous 2).  **** This game is not 100% move compatible. Only the mini-games work with MOVE ****The remastered HD graphics look amazing.  Despite some roughness,  Sly looks great in 720p.  The game plays very smooth with no graphic hick-ups , frame rate issues or tearing you might see in a simple texture upscale.  Very professionally handled upgrade to 720p** Overall if you heard about sly and never checked it out - or simply wish to relive a classic you once owned this package is perfect.  The price is fairly reasonable since you automatically know you are getting 3 classic, A+ games  instead of paying $60 for perhaps a bust.  The Sly Cooper series is definitely a unique series of games that will provide you with hours upon hours of fun , laughs and not once feel as if the game is being repetitiveEdit (12/10/10)After re-reading my review I might as well throw in what scores I'd give these 3 games and the mini-games.Sly 1 - 97%  a great game for people of all ages and brings a unique look at being a thiefSly 2 - 86%  still a great game for all ages, but doesn't seem nearly as memorable gameplay wise (an overload of mini-games maybe)Sly 3 - 94%  Combining what made Sly 1 and Sly 2 so great, Sly 3 fires on all cylinders making for a well paced adventure.Sly Mini-Games -  21%  yeah that's right. In fact I'm being nice about it.  They use Move technology but honestly, you'll play these once probably to get the trophies (which can be done on your first play w/ a regular controller) and never revisit them again.  Basically \"move\" versions of mini-games found throughout the Sly Trilogy using true 720p graphics.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A classic remastered ... times 3", "unixReviewTime": 1291680000, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2010"}

Graphically, everything has been converted to HD very nicely.  I never felt like I was playing outdated games based on the visuals.I did, however, feel like the games were outdated in terms of content.  Dodge an enemy attack and awkwardly counter before he swings again.  In the first game Sly has to shimmy to get across wires despite being a raccoon!  The platforming in these games is consistently awkward and imprecise.  At one stretch they took to having you push the circle button to make Sly automatically land on the proper jump points.  The whole thing is just clumsy, repetitive, and light years behind Ratchet & Clank (even the PS2 games).  The non-platforming stages include cliches like having to win a race and manning a turret gun to cover your ally as he tries to retrieve a key you need to advance.  They felt as if I had played them before and were not fun at all.I got less than half way through Sly 1, tried to get into Sly 2, but have now given up.  With so many great titles out for PS3 these days, there's no reason to waste your time and money here.  Now I know why this franchise has been without a new release for so long.

Most HD trilogies are perfectly optimized for the PS3, save a few of course like the infamous Silent Hill HD Collection (don't even get me started on that one) and this is definitely worthy of being one of the better collections.

Included on one disk is Sly 1, 2, 3 and a 4 mini games.  The mini games are worthless, just a bunch of 30 second motion games to demo the Move.  All three Sly games are presented in 720p HD.  The games are clearly much cleaner, sharper and just overall more graphic.  The framerate is also much smoother.  The sound is also much cleaner and stronger.  All three games feature trophy support (very easy to platinum all three).  Really those who want Sly in HD should pick this collection up.  Those who always wanted to try out Sly, they should probably pick the collection up.  For those who never liked Sly, obviously this collection isn't for you.  These games are not built from the ground up, but rather just polished and refinished a bit.  Sly to the Sly Collection is just like God of War to the God of War Collection.  While the games are not built from the ground up, the graphical enhancement is clear as day.  The games look much better than the original ps2 versions.For those who don't know the series, it is an interesting mix of Metal Gear Solid, Mario and Ocean's Eleven.  My main draw to the series is the unique factor.  I have played hundreds of games, many just seem like the same game I have played before.  Sly does not fall into that category.  It stands as a very unique experience and there isn't much quite like it.  The gameplay is a mix of platforming and sneaking around.  The games are certainly lighthearted and not adult themed, which works for me.  I enjoy Mario, Pixar, etc.The only complaints I have is the price (probably better at $35 or $30) and the mini games are terrible.

Rather than having a very linear, get the keys from beating each of the individual zones and then beat the boss feel of the first game (reminding me of Crash Bandicoot), Sly 2 actually had a larger world to roam and a grand hesit at the end of each zone to which all the previous quests had been leading towards.It is unfortunate, however, that Sly 3 did not provide the same sort of excitement that Sly 2 did. Not only did it take away the grand heist concept, but it unfortunately, for reasons that still ellude me, also removed the bottles, chests and treasures that made the first and second games so great. (Treasures were a great addition to SLy 2). The missing factor of these in Sly 3 almost makes me want to give the entire collection a 4-star rating, but I just loved Sly 2 too much to do so.

{"reviewerID": "A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5", "asin": "B003O680RM", "reviewerName": "W. freeman", "helpful": [8, 13], "reviewText": "I remember buying the first sly back around oh i dunno 2003 or so and being blown away. The game is a was so original, i played it all the way through with great pleasure. On the regular tube TV i used back then the game looked great and it looked just like all the PS2 exclusives, very stellar. The gameplay is smooth as ever in the new revamped version and the 720p as it states on the box looks just as good as anything 1080p, no one would know the difference. Of course the graphics aren't going to look BETTER from a texture, anti aliasing standpoint, thats not what they went after. The games have all been remastered to make it look great on todays LCD, Plasma, and LED tv's. And it does. I picked this game up yesterday and just started the first sly, and its just like playing a real cartoon, the colors are crisp, the movements slick and the gameplay is still amazing as i remember.Another thing i like is that you can select any of the Sly games at anytime during your gameplay, thats great. The only things that are locked are the mini games, which i'm anxious to see what they are. I don't have(use) or want a playstation move, especially for a game like this. This is a classic revamped platformer made to enjoy, and for 40 bucks it can't be beat. The game seems kidish to people, but not to me, its a nice break from all the Call Of Duties, Bioshock, Mafia kill shoot mame type of games and i really think they should do more. The point was to bring this game to the masses in Hi def, so people could experience what a great series this really is, now i just can't wait to see Sly 4, whenever they get a street date for it.So don't be fooled BY fools, these games are just as they were and better. One thing you will notice is on the PS2 you would have just a little bit of lag in certain areas. That is all but gone and the frame rate smoothness is superb, very fast. I played Sly 2 and got about half way through it then ended up getting married and selling my old PS2 years ago, ha! Now i'm single and can play all i want without being bugged. So i'm pretty excited to play Sly 3 since i never have played it at all, and every single game just kept getting rated higher and higher so i can imagine how good it is. But its hard to improve on perfection, but they managed to. So these games are great, and very fun to play, there are so many things to do within the game other than just your main objective, like finding all the clues to open each vault at the end of levels. This is quite a challenge sometimes.So in concluding, i will say this is way worth the price and let me tell you i played Call Of Duty Black Ops and wow what a flop, i would play this any day over that. The old Call of Duties were 10 times better and i've read that i'm not the only one who feels that way. So if you want a good game where you sneak, climb, hang, and do a little fighting these games are for you. And your kids if you like. I really hope PS3 does more of these remastered PS2 game additions, they are great. This one is my all time favorite.Some other titles that need revamped in hi def-OR make them downloadable on PSN.Maximo's-though thats asking a lot since there were only 2.The Haunted Mansion-Yeah i know right, who would have thought of that, but what a great obscure game.Resident Evil 4-ITS WORTHY, i play it on pc and it still doesnt offer even 720p, sigh. That would be great.All the ATV Offroad series.Colossus is on its way i see, that should be sweet.Rygar-Make it a downloadAll the good castlevania's for PS2, make a pack or downloadable.So get Sly have fun and don't waste your money on some of the new way more expensive, less fun titles that came out. Be nostalgic and enjoy. Btw Nintendo needs to get its rear in gear and make games for the wii in HD, and even make the old titles HD as well. Epsecially the Donkey Kong Country series.

{"reviewerID": "A1MRPX3RM48T2I", "asin": "B003O680RM", "reviewerName": "Winter", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "When I saw this remaster, I had to ask myself, \"What's the point of 'remastering' this?  Cel-shaded graphics are really only so good...\"Even if you've played these titles already on the PS2 and you're just in the mood to play them again, this is money well spent.  The Sly Cooper games are fun, they're entertaining, and as a PS3 re-release I was surprised at how very much clearer everything looks.  The Sly Collection isn't going to look Final-Fantasy-realistic, and you wouldn't want it to, but you'd be amazed at how many details you didn't realize you were missing before.  Levels look sharper, colors are a bit more vivid, but then we get all the other added bonuses that you'd expect in an update:  trophies and minigames (the minigames do require a PlayStation Move controller).For those of you not familiar with these games, Sly Cooper is a kind of 'gentleman thief'.  Playing him is less about smashing things around like your typical platformer and more about being clever and sneaky.  There are occasional gadgets and abilities that you can unlock for Sly, plus the trilogy gets a bit more open and less linear the further you go.  Sly can't do it all by himself though:  he is aided by his driver and muscle \"Murray\" (a hippo with a heart of gold) and his uber-geek genius Bentley (a turtle with a brain the size of a planet).  At times you get to play each of these characters, and while their abilities do the same things as Sly's, you have to do those things in a different way (for example, Murray can't climb along wires and Bentley really can't run very fast).Moving Sly around is fairly simple:  there are very few times in which I had trouble pulling off a series of moves, that a couple more tries didn't fix.  The stealth mechanic of the Sly games is very forgiving:  if you do get in over your head, often being judicious enough to run away will solve all your problems.  While I can remember having a bit of a tough time getting the hang of Sly years ago when I was new to consoles, the difficulty and pacing of the games seem to be just about right.  There are whole stretches of the series that you can easily make your way through and have fun, and then a few bottlenecks that tend to resolve themselves before reloading a bunch of times.For me, the Sly Collection was an excellent way to relive old times.  It also has me a lot more excited at the prospects of a \"Sly Cooper 4\" built exclusively for the PlayStation 3.  If you haven't tried the original, or you're just in the mood to play them again, you owe it to yourself to check out The Sly Collection.NOTE:  There is one huge glitch you want to be aware of though:  one of the musical minigames in the first title has you timing your button presses to the beat of your enemy's notes.  We discovered that the rhythm of the remastered audio was just slightly out of sync with the game, and it made catching the right moment incredibly difficult.  I think this has to do with using a system (TV or Home Theater Receiver) that has Lip Sync enabled...because your opponent doesn't really have 'lips', the hardware gets the timing of the sound off-kilter with the visuals.  If you experience this, just turn off Lip Sync and you should be able to get through it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well Worth Revisiting", "unixReviewTime": 1320278400, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2011"}

I will give updates and continue to rate this game as I progress.My initial view on this game is very negative. I love the other 3 incarnations of this series but they have changed so much for this game that it seems entirely different. We no longer have the cinematic opening. We have credits to what seems like is going to be some sort of a Grand Theft Auto rip off. The when the game starts we have cut scenes of cardboard characters trying to get us into a story mode. It is a very lame attempt. I want to race. You can skip this, which is a good thing. Then the racing starts.The initial race just gets you acclimated to the environment and controls. This is fine. You just have to finish the first one and there is no way to place. The controls feel just like every other version of Motorstorm that has come before.I skipped the next cut scene. The second race was rather cool but it had huge problems. The controls are tight and just as good as the other games. The problem here is with the camera. Now, I understand that there is a lot of carnage and wreckage happening here but they shake the camera as to make it damn near impossible to  enjoy the scenery. With everything happening I would like to get a look at it. Instead I was given a splitting headache from the unnecessary shaking. It was bad. Instead of being able to race, your eyes have to continue to adjust from the jerking camera. This is not good.This is as far as I have made it so far. I am not impressed. Too much has been changed. I will more than give this a chance. I am going to play the whole game through. I love the series, but there seems to be a lot that has to be overlooked at this point. I just don't understand why the Apocalypse angle couldn't be enough of a change for this game. Instead, they change the whole damn thing. Not impressed at all.I will continue to change the rating and update as I progress.Update #1: The next dayOK, I have played 3 more races and I wanted to sleep on my initial response to the game. I am more annoyed by the camera than I was yesterday. The camera shaking is so excessive. It is to the point of being ridiculous. It really takes away from the actual racing aspect of the game. I don't mind the destruction 1 bit but the camera shaking is just plain retarded. I want insane speeds with some solid racing. All we get so far is a shaking camera. The other 3 versions of Motorstorm had the perfect blend that gave an immersive arcade feel to it. This has gone so far over the top that it takes away from the actual game play. As of now, I still stand by the 2 star rating. I am going to give this a chance....Update #2 (and maybe the last)The game is terrible. You can't ever tell where you are supposed to go. You have to follow other vehicles and it takes 3 or 4 races before you can get a real feel as to where to go. And then you have to hope that you don't crash 50 times before you get to the end of the race. I would rather be able to race instead of worrying about crashing in to EVERYTHING on the screen. This game really took the enjoyment out of the racing aspect. It is a racing game that doesn't ever really become a racing game. I just finished the rookie last night and I am ready to sell the game.The tracks are not fun to race. This game is all spectacle and no substance. It is very disappointing as the last 3 Motorstorm games were fantastic. This game is a huge mistake. Like movies, they were more concerned with the 3D rather than the actual gameplay. And when it comes to the speed of the game they changed the formula. You get to crazy ridiculous speeds in a millisecond and then all you can do is crash at that point because you can't make anything out going that fast.I really cannot believe that Motorstorm was reduced to this. I love the series so damn much and was really looking forward to this game. What a huge letdown.Update #3I am going to attempt to play this on a a smaller screen to see if that makes any difference. I played the last 2 versions on my 146\" screen and was just fine with that. It was amazing, but this one, with all the shaking and camera movements, has caused me to rethink that maybe it will be playable on something smaller. I will find out shortly.Final update:I am 6 races from finishing the game and I have given the game 3 stars. 1 more than my initial view. This is by far the worst of the series but it is not a bad game. I did play the rest of the game on a 50\" screen vs. the 146\" I started with. THAT made a huge difference. With the camera movements and destruction on the screen it was too much on a big screen. The smaller screen made it playable. The races actually were much better after the rookie. They were varied and it was much easier to see where you were supposed to go. There were even times where it felt like classic motorstorm. I have enjoyed the game but I do not love it as I did the last 3. I hope they continue the series or even just add on new tracks and races to the 2 previous PS3 releases.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Motorstorm Apocalypse - My Review", "unixReviewTime": 1304380800, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2011"}

This game is not very realistic and is very chaotic. If you play this you will crash a lot.  There is destruction and debris everywhere you will never have a clean run in this game. It is a game built for online multiplayer and at its best when racing against 10 or more human competitors. If you don't plan on racing online than you'll probably want to stay away from this game the campaign \"festival\" mode is fun but not worth a full retail purchase. If you just want to have fun racing and not worry about executing a perfect turn and every hundredth of a second on your lap time you will have fun.The cars don't really have stats but you will get to know which classes suit your driving style. Boost is the key to this game if you master it and cooling you engine you will do well. There are many different paths to the finish line which makes using different car classes fun since some open up new options on a track. This is a good game and one of the best racers for online competition, just don't expect a realistic ride.Update: Evolution the developer of this game has done a great amazing the best job I have ever seen supporting this game. Since release they have added: a mode editor, weekly challenges, downloadable events, multiplayer balancing tweeks, a few new tracks, and all for free. This game did not sell very well due to PSN outage and the earthquake in Japan. Evolution has gained a major fan here and will be looking to purchase anything from this studio in the future.Also in my original review I stated there really wasnt enough single player content to warrant a purchase this has changed to more than enough single player content for a full retail purchase with the weekly challenges and downloadable events, which are single player ways to earn chips for online play and vehicle unlocks.Cheers to Evolution!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing game support for free.", "unixReviewTime": 1306800000, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2011"}
{"reviewerID": "A3DBUN9EMFMUV1", "asin": "B003O680ZY", "reviewerName": "Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "With wind and rain whipping at your face, and two cars sandwiching you between them, you hurdle forward at a breakneck pace in your battered car while buildings explode behind you. Suddenly, the manhole covers all around you begin to erupt with pillars of fire, causing you and your rivals to swerve radically in order to avoid getting incinerated. But just as you think you're in the clear, time slows to a screeching halt as the entire road blows up in front of you, creating a makeshift ramp above a blazing chasm. Hitting your boost, you leave your opponents in your dust as your car soars mere feet above the raging inferno below you. All of this happens in less than 15 seconds. This is the chaotic world of \"Motorstorm Apocalypse\", which houses the most fun I've had with a racing game since \"Burnout Revenge.\"There is a plot to this festival of carnage, which, as you may have guessed, is pretty terrible. Throughout the paper thin story, you take control of three different characters who belong to a roaming group of racing junkies. This motley crew runs around in a post-apocalyptic society and race each other because... well, because they want to, I suppose. There's nothing particularly engaging about these characters, and their interactions only serve as a segway from one race to another. While there is a certain shlocky B-movie charm to the cheesy dialogue and \"Road Warrior\"-derived plot, that charm is sucked out by the disparagingly low-rent motion comic cutscenes, which look cheap and are immensely disjointed at times. If you don't go in expecting too much, and instead view the whole story as a funny checklist of cliches (oppressive corporations, warring factions, etc.) to get a few cheap laughs out of, you'll do just fine.Nobody expects a good plot from a racing game, however, and Evolution Studios is well aware of this. That's why their game picks up the slack with the actual act of driving, with some of the most responsive and fluid controls seen in a modern game of this genre. While I did experience some irritating moments of getting caught in a tricky skid, or overshooting a turn and ramming smack-dab into a wall, these were mainly due to my lack of effort with the controls. Unlike many contemporaries, \"MS: Apocalypse\" doesn't simply move you in a straight line and only expect you to accelerate and make minimal turns. It expects you to take full advantage of each track, micromanaging every turn, skid, and jump you make. It's been a while since a racing game has made me pay full attention to what I'm doing at all times, and it's certainly a welcome change of pace from the linear eye candy that passes as a \"racing game\" lately. If all of the games in this franchise are like this, then a few more games are going to be added to my permanent collection very soon.Where this game also impresses are the tracks. Each course is a living, breathing thing, a veritable deathtrap that waits expectantly for you to make one wrong turn so it can wreck your car. As you progress in the story mode, each course becomes more and more dangerous, and each experience is unique due to your constantly shifting vehicles. Expect to dodge boats being flung at you by a hurricane while barreling forward in a bulky truck, and to soar from rooftop to collapsing rooftop in an ATV. If the \"Uncharted\" series and a car had a baby after watching the \"Mad Max\" trilogy, this would be the adrenaline-charged result. Even replaying the same course in the campaign is never the same, and with plenty of time to spend with it (not to mention trophies to earn), the single player experience is definitely worth the price of admission. Add that on top of your typical Tournament and Elimination modes, plus both online and offline multiplayer modes, and you've got a robust package for your average racing fan.That being said, there are a few negatives worth mentioning. What needs to be called out first and foremost is the abhorrent, dreadful, nauseating \"music\" that thumps and \"wub-wubs\" throughout your time with the game. As a longtime lover of electronic music, this horrible collection of generic dubstep is downright offensive to even my auditory senses. Luckily, the racing sounds are loud and exciting enough to drown out this mess, but those not keen to the \"brostep\" fad deserve some fair warning. Another point of lamentation revolves around how long the action takes to get off the ground. For a good portion of game's beginning, you'll be driving through some very similar landscapes, to the point where you get a bit bored of the same color schemes and track designs. This may dissuade some players with short attention spans, but the wait is certainly worth it, considering how loony the racing gets later on.Graphically, this game is a mixed bag. Some of the most vibrant levels look gorgeous, and acts of massive destruction are breathtaking in their sheer scale and unpredictability. Also impressive is the consistent damage your vehicles take throughout the course of each race. At the same time, some of the more urban landscapes look very drab and dull unless there's a storm or series of earthquakes to spice them up, and the aforementioned motion comics look very sloppy and out of place when held up to the rest of the game. Overall, some levels dazzle, while kind of fall to the wayside while you focus on the race.What does deserve some praise, though, are the 3D effects. While I'm still not a believer in buying a 3D TV, this is a nice game to showcase one if you happen to already own it. I demonstrated a level to one of my family members, who hates 3D, and even she was blown away by the effort that went into the effects here. Levels such a pier being ravaged by a massive tornado and a suburban town getting torn apart by an earthquake are some of the best for this feature. If you've got a 3D TV, or the Playstation 3D Display (which was the rig I played this on), 3D definitely enhances the overall graphical experience, and makes it easy to overlook some of the lower resolution textures and the occasional boring level.The gangs in \"Road Warrior\" have nothing on this gang of post-apocalyptic daredevils. If you've been left in the cold by recent driving games that are too linear or too rigid for you to enjoy, \"Motorstorm Apocalypse\" is a one-two punch of hardcore racing and stunt action. Once you overlook some its flaws, you'll be on the edge of your seat and obsessing over getting just ONE RANK HIGHER in each action-packed race. For the money, it's a great little title, and nice PS3 exclusive for racing and action junkies.Plot: 7.5Gameplay: 9Graphics: 8Sound: 7.5Overall: 8", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Is Anybody Alive Out There?", "unixReviewTime": 1341792000, "reviewTime": "07 9, 2012"}

Motorstorm Apocalypse doesn't rectify this, but the repetitive gameplay is corrected with a new 'story mode' and an overall superior presentation. The loss of a customizable soundtrack is a bit of a bummer though.California has been destroyed by The Big One. Cities are in ruins and the decent citizens have fled, leaving everything behind. The Motorstormers have taken the city and turned it into a giant, crumbling arena filled with instant, very violent death. I'm not going to lie, there are several moments in this game where you'll leap right out of your chair as buildings crumble around you, the ground cracks open with new fissures and chasms, and bridges collapse as you fire across them. I hope your lung capacity is good because you'll be holding your breath a lot, and sweating through your shirt.

{"reviewerID": "AY55J49QMLEYA", "asin": "B003O680ZY", "reviewerName": "Jason", "helpful": [23, 27], "reviewText": "Just got this game today and have been playing it for several hours now.  It is a lot of fun.  The controls have been tightened up since Pacific Rift.  The various vehicles still handle differently, but the new cars are very fun, and are a great addition to the Motorstorm series.  The graphics are great in game-play and the city-landscape is fleshed out well, though the colors of the city, the crazy people you end up running over, the (what struck me as) slightly James Bond '70s TV show music and the over-the-top comic cut scenes add a sort of \"don't take this too seriously\" feel to the game.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, in fact, I think it's a good direction for Motorstorm as a franchise, because sometimes I felt Pacific Rift took itself too seriously.You begin playing Apocalypse and notice some interesting ways they get you up to speed with the story and how to utilize the game controls and strategies.  In no time at all you're racing and winning races and thinking to yourself \"this is really easy.\"  But before too long you find some incredibly difficult tracks and the other players make life slightly more challenging.  I was worried with the over-the-top track chaos and the insane \"difficult to handle vehicle\" mechanics that this game would be way to difficult.  I feel those fears have been revealed.  The skyline track you probably have seen if you've watched demos of the game showed an insane track that was almost impossible not to die in and have numerous frustrating \"really?\" moments.  It's true that at times the game is frustrating and there are moments I found myself upset at the game for killing me.  But half those times, I really did realize deep down that I crashed because I was stupid and made a mistake-other times I was driving a mudplugger at 90mph and hoping to make it turn left to avoid a bridge support and let's be honest, that's probably not going to happen.The more I play this game the more I realize just how much it is about chaos.  It's insane fun ripping around the track and while I have many times hit those \"oh snap\" or \"that's not cool!\" moments where you feel either the insane grace the game has given you or the way in which it seems to be cheating, it's still just a lot of fun.  It never feels like it's impossible to win, just difficult, you have to learn the tracks later in the game to do well and when you're racing through a track that's falling a part that's when this game is at its' best.  Sadly, towards the end of the game I am noticing less of those kinds of tracks.  However, the destruction and devastation still looks great even \"after the fact\".  Besides almost ever track still provides tons of intense racing, lots of different paths to choose from and crazy competition even if the track isn't falling apart as you race it.  Let me be clear, half if not more have real-time changing effects altering the track some of which are on the verge of insanity which is one of the many elements that drives this game towards awesomeness.  I loved Motorstorm Pacific Rift but this one beckons me to continue playing where as I have yet to finish Pacific Rift to the final leveling up.  I think the reason this one is more addictive is due to the intense sense of speed, the tracks and the great feel of arcade racing.What I love about this game is the sense of insane speed, the chaotic tracks and the over-the-top feel the game has to it.  It really scream \"arcade\" and it really feels arcade down to the \"what were they smoking?\" cut-scenes.  The game does a great job of creating great tracks with an insanely fun arcade racing experience and it does it so well you'll be unable to take your eyes off the road to look at what place your in let alone what time it is or where your girlfriend has wandered off to.If you like arcade racing games, motorstorm games, great racing tracks then what are you waiting for?

Amazing graphics and crazy intense from what I played last night. The races are tighter and faster, therefore, it seems like either the game engrosses my attention span too much or the campaign is that short. I played through roughly 15-20 races last night and 5 hours had passed. I guess that's good, right? But at the same time, the game is so good I guess I just don't want it to end. Played non-3D first, and my jaw hung open during every race. Then, I tackled 3D for a few races.. my jaw is now dislocated and I'm seeking medical therapy. I can only type this because I can't talk. This is somewhat a nuisance.All jokes aside, the game is great.For those skeptical and turned off by other reviews saying that the campaign mode is non-relevant and a horrible addition, I kindly disagree. The motion comics are for the most part fun to watch, and garner a laugh from time to time. It's a fresh idea, and I commend developers for adding a little life to the franchise. If it bothers you THAT much, you can skip each cut-scene with a simple press of the 'X' button. These scenarios remind me of the cut-scenes in inFamous, and they are very colorful and interesting to watch between races.My ONLY gripe is that all races in the campaign look to have PREDETERMINED vehicles chosen, whereas previous Motorstorm games would have a few predetermined races set up but most would give you the option of which vehicle to battle it out in. There is an option in \"Wreckreation\" mode on the main menu that allows freely choosing vehicles and tracks to FREE PLAY as many you like, which is fine. Therefore, I suppose you could say they covered all their bases, but it would have been fun to have vehicle choice within the actual campaigns.There. I'm off the soapbox.

I wanted realistic, pure racing, not this post-apocalyptic poop.The glory days of Motorstorm, Motorstorm: Pacific Ridge and Motorstorm: Arctic's Edge are GONE... 2 horrible entries to the series in less than a year? Well, I am officially disappointed...The game DOES work, it is by no means broken, but it just does not work in the sense of the series.

This is not just the old PR engine cut and pasted into an concrete jungle, the driving will take a little getting used to, and at first I was not impressed. It is possible to get used to it though, and you'll be flying around tracks faster and more effectively then you ever were in PR after a little practice. In fact I actually used to hate rally cars, now I can control them better, I guess they are a little less...randomly floaty? It's likely the handling is off a bit from PR becuase of the new perks system in which you race online to earn more then just rank, you earn vehicle upgrades both mechanical and cosmetic. In fact online IS the game now, and Single-Player Festival can be completely ignored as it does not unlock anything! (except a few extras about the new motion comic storyline and an even harder difficulty).For me it wasn't really worth nearly ripping my controller in half just to face the cheap and cheaper AI, whose primary goal was not that they'll win, but that you won't. They constantly slam you, \"accidentally\" bump your back tire, or in some way destabilize you to run into something, sometimes [by the veteran class] even teaming up to \"accidentally\" knock you out. You would have thought the city falling down around you would be challenge enough, I felt that the cheap AI was annoying and unnecessary. I also could have done without the stupid rebels (peds) that throw molotovs and shoot machine guns and rockets at you, overheating you and then grab on to you car when you go by.-Tracks-If you want to play the circuits without other people distracting you or without the track interactively rising and falling around you, there is still a time trial mode with all the circuit tracks from festival unlocked from the start. A few tracks from the festival are not present in that mode simply becuase they don't loop (Such as the first city track people saw in the preview video from E3 2010). There are 8 track regions based on areas from San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Fransisco and each region has about 3 circuit routes taking place at different times in the destruction. The routes laid out are a mix of awesome and terrible. If you remember getting lost in some of the Pacific Rift tracks, prepare to get even more lost here, sometimes more than others. They did their best at laying out road flares and motion arrow signs where you need them, but sometimes it gets lost in the smoke and dust clouds and you drive through to find yourself moments from a wall or barrier. The \"Interstate\" tracks were the most confusing. I found myself following the \"road\" too often, rather then knowing when to cut across and there's jersey walls and slim immovable poles all over that can easily be overlooked and slammed into amidst all the texture blending together and coming at you at once. You just need to run the courses in Time Trial a few laps to learn the correct paths, learn what not to hit, what's breakable and what's concreted in place, and to learn all the possible shortcuts of which their are MANY, I'd say at least 3 different ways to go at every turn. A good tip in this motorstorm is to head for the ramps, even if you don't need to get up anywhere, getting air and releasing the accelerator and nitro at the same time on the way back to the ground does wonders for engine cooling now, as well as water which there is plenty of gushing out of the broken water mains and pooling in all the newly created crevices in the streets.I'd say my favorite region is Skyline. Jumping across skyscrapers and through offices reminds me of my favorite levels from the Twisted Metals, except they never did rooftops this well. It's even more awesome when buildings are just falling left and right, you just feel like OMG WTF am I doing on these rooftops? Craziness (more so cause I usually use Big-Rigs or Monster-Trucks).-Vehicles-To travel these routes there are now 13 classes of vehicles to choose from. At first I thought that was way lame that there are only 3 cars for each class (not including DLC) and 2 of each are locked from the start, but now that I've tried to use all the classes I see that that's plenty. The classes are now: Dirt-bikes, ATVs, Super-bikes(Sport bikes), Choppers, Buggies, Rally Cars, Super-Minis(Hatch-backs), Muscle Cars, Super Cars(Exotics), Racing Trucks, Mudpluggers, Big Rigs, and Monster Trucks. While I was bummed most of my favorites from the last two games didn't make it over, I think I can definitely make due with what's here. What's more is you can customize them a little now.First off, it is NOT like Midnight Club in depth so don't get overexcited about that, but it's very decent for a motorstorm game. They made sure to give you just enough to make sure your car is noticeably different from others online (or offline, you can also use them in Single Race and Time Trial). I was just happy to finally color my vehicle a normal color and get all the vinyls off. The Livery system offers a bunch of 1, 2, and 3 color full-body vinyls. I felt most of them were a little too \"busy\" in their designs, many of them tend to just clutter your car with detail, but there are good simpler ones too, as well as an option to just Remove.There are enough options unlocked from the start for you to spend some time in the customizer just getting your colors right, and there are seriously a TON of vinyls, stickers, and parts to unlock via online.-ONLINE-I find Online to be more fun this time around, because of all you can unlock, and the fact that you can gain points for more than just where you place. That's great for me, since I'm usually happy coming in somewhere around the middle of the grid, so I don't have to kill myself with the stress of having to place high or lose points. Since the whole game is in the Online mode, they have adapted it to not simply take points when you lose, you just don't get as much. They also have increased the amount of time before DNF after the 1st racer crosses the line to 60 seconds rather then 30, so more can actually finish.Besides your finishing position, you also gain points for Drifting, Air-time, Completing a Race (not rage-quitting) and wrecking opponents by use of the boost nudge (which is probably why people rage-quit). I wasn't too happy that the game RELIES on messing up other racers in order to get ahead, but it only unlocks some parts, new cars will still unlock even if you never wreck people.To unlock all the, let's say Big-Rigs, you have to compete in races using the Rig that is unlocked, so no more whole packages of cars all at once. Another added feature is betting against other racers, which is why points are called \"(poker) chips\". I'm not a gambler so I haven't used it, but I can say someone almost always bets against me, and I almost always win that bet by the end = free chips for me :)Apocalypse also introduces a new \"Perks\" system which is sort of like attaching 3 enhancements to all your vehicles. For example the ones I have allow me to:1.) Reset faster after a crash2.) Cool down in the air with the accelerator down (becuase I often forget to release it)3.) Resist getting boost nudged, becuase even though I don't like to be an ass online, plenty of people have no problem running you down, remember it's actually ENCOURAGED to progress faster. I think the thing I'm most disappointed with in Online play is the host still has the option to dis-include certain car classes from a race. So it's a little hard to level up a particular class when it's always left out, and it's also good to practice a little with everything, you never know when a class you never use will end up the only one allowed and your just out of luck there.I spent my whole first day simply trying to visit all the circuits in via time trial mode, and utilizing the customization options, Just that is a lot to take in. Just for what I did offline without the earth shaking was awesome fun but at the same time there is an off element to the ruined city in offline mode that monument valley also had, but Pacific Rift did not share. At the end of the day, when the adrenaline has run dry, you kind of want to go home. As in you would not want to just hang out in a destroyed ever-collapsing city as it falls into the Pacific, anymore then you would want to hang out in the middle of an arid Arizona desert well exceeding 100-degrees.However Pacific Rift's Hawaiian paradise environment was beautiful, I could roam the lush jungles, passing water falls and lava-flows forever, alone or with friends. It's like it felt more inviting but at the same time deadly, whereas the same bland broken concrete rubble textures gets a little old after awhile. They did a spectacular job of thinking out how a city would break and making it look right, but you just NEED to be going too fast and be too focused on the epic race to get full enjoyment out of this setting.However it is you prefer to play there is plenty of replay here, I'd say this should be high on every race fan's list of games to get this year.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not Better then, Alternative to Pacific Rift, and Equally as Great", "unixReviewTime": 1308700800, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2011"}

I will say that its graphics are the best to date in a Motorstorm game and the the controls are very responsive.  The game feels like the difficulty may have been ramped down a little, but it is still enjoyable, nonetheless.  I have played the full one hour game trial and downloaded the bundle that includes all DLC that is supposedly 50% off for playstation plus subscribers.  You can get the game for about thirty five bucks most places now so the benefit to the bundle through PSN is really getting all DLC for free which still is a decent deal.  What I really wanted to talk about is the 3D experience.  If you have a 3D television, this game, in my opinion, does the best job with 3D of any of the 3D compatible games I have purchased to date.  While I enjoyed Gran Turismo 5 and Ghost Recon future soldier I think the 3D in both of them was tacked on and therefore was horrible.  Blacks Ops did a better job with 3D than those two games but Motorstorm Apocolypse is the 3D experience I was waiting for.

The game is very fun, and keeps you on edge with all the chaos it inssues, that's not a problem at all. The problem is the game is way to short and you can open every track without having to qualify, which can be tough, or very easy. The graphics look good, but from what i've heard a lot of different people stepped on board this time, some makers of 2k games Borderlands being the most obvious, from a graphical perspective. The game really looks nothing like the others, but then again is the Apocalypse, so it's suppose to be totally different. I find it very tense making buildings fall, tornadoes throwing things at you, helicopters, waves, and just an over sense of pure chaos. So that's why i give it a thumbs up. Thats for gameplay. Graphically it's one of the lesser good looking PS3 exclusives to hit the console. Rushed perhaps? The steering control is much better, but the over the top psychics when wrecking are totally gone. GrrrOther than that it is what it says, racing with things crashing burning and falling all around you, nothing more nothing less. I dig it just because it's a welcome change, i just wish more time had went into the car designs(which look awful) and the overall detailing and textures of the scenery.

At first I disliked that the hint function reactivated rather slowly, i.e. when I had used a hint I had to wait a considerable amount of time before the next hint became available, but as the game progressed I didn't mind anymore because I realized that I tended to click on it too quickly anyway and more often than not was able to solve them on my own after all.The puzzles are diverse and new, i.e. these are challenges that I haven't seen before (no connecting pipes or memory games here...). Sometimes one needs to collect several things and put those together to use them, and sometimes things found in the hidden objects scenes were retained in the inventory and used later in the game. I especially appreciated the latter because so often in other games of this genre, hidden object screens serve no purpose at all in terms of storyline.Lastly, I appreciated that the game designers were mindful of the gamer's time in that they did not make too many simultaneous scenes available that one could go to at a given time.

I sat down on the couch one night with my significant other and we both enjoyed a hidden object game that was unlike any HOG i had played before.  There was a spooky storyline to follow, hidden objects to find, and a wide assortment of puzzles.  There are quite a few scenes to explore and each one is a treat to view, the developers put a lot of detail and love into each scene.  Some objects are difficult to find, but there is a hint system in place that shows you the general area it's in and it recharges so you can use it over and over.  We've enjoyed the soundtrack so far, it seems appropriate for the New Orleans setting.  Overall this is quite a little gem.  It's the first i've played in years so maybe im overly excited because it's so new to me.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "HOG Heaven!", "unixReviewTime": 1306454400, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2011"}

I thought that the game was a bit repetitive but I get the feeling that this is common in hidden object games. It only took me three hours to finish the game which was a bit dissapointing, I was hoping that it would last me a few days. The puzzels were fun but a bit easy which is ok if you like instant gratification. The art work was awesome, and though the hidden object parts were repetitive I now find that looking for stuff in my closet is a lot easier! It was fun and very entertaining, much cheeper than going out to a movie as where I live its about 15$ a ticket.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A bit too easy.", "unixReviewTime": 1295049600, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2011"}

Deadtime is a work of art.You  begin your creepy journey in a cemetery where the caretaker, Edward Blackgate, is very persnikety about whom he lets in for their eternal rest. However, rest is really not the word. These graveyard inhabitants are very lively ghosts indeed. As the game begins we zero in on the gravestone of Jessie Bodeen, a voodoo prietess of the New Orleans of  long ago, when slaves were bought and sold. Jessie uses her occult talents to cure the sick and champion the weak until a snooty socialite named Delphine LaLaurie sends for her. Greed and revenge are alive and well in this rich story and you are carried along on the murky tide, a tide writhing with black magic and voodoo spells, and just plain fun for you, the player.You will be collecting a gruesome assortment of stuff: many skulls, a headless doll, deadly poisons, a chicken head, three drops of blood from a tree weeping blood, three tears of a saint and much more. At each level of the game you'll be creating a voodoo potion, a spell to clear obstacles and let you advance. You even get to construct your own voodoo doll when Jesse's doll is stolen by vengeful spirits. The mini-games you encounter  as you enter the various emvironments  (including the French Quarter and an alligator-infested swamp) are original  and colorful and  many of them are just plain hard. No ordinary puzzle fillers like jigsaws, sliders and connecting the pipes appear in Deadtime. The puzzle games are just as outstanding as the rest of this production. Highly recommended and this download version is a bargain.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Creepy and imaginative with beautiful graphics", "unixReviewTime": 1290124800, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2010"}

He tells you that every grave has an inhabitant with a story. The story to be told in this game is about Jessie, a voodoo queen in old New Orleans.I liked this game very much. The graphics are outstanding and the scenery is eerie as befitting the storyline. Much of the gameplay involves collecting ingredients for potions which I enjoyed concocting.The puzzles in this game are topnotch. There are a few anagram type games, one involving a wheel of skeleton heads that reveal a secret message when you click them in the right order. There's a logic game where you put medicine bottles in the correct order on some pharmacy shelves. In one game you use a potion to \"paint\" spirits and set them free.As another reviewer mentions, the game creators considerately point you towards the scenes you need to interact with next as the game goes on. You are provided a carriage which lists the relevant locations and then takes you there.I definitely am looking forward to the next installment of this game.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Good", "unixReviewTime": 1284854400, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2010"}

The graphics and scenes weren't as interesting as many other HOGs, and I wasn't really into the storyline at all.

It's not too hard but surely not easy either and is just about right...not good for kids I would guess.The lows are, the items are too dark in some areas to see well, and it must have been written in another country because they call the same thing by different name a lot of times. A tooth brush is a brush in one level and then NOT a brush in another level and so forth.The good thing is the hints are unlimited I think, but I didn't use very many so I'm guessing on that, but no &#34;number left&#34; are ever shown.It has was too much going back and forth trying to find the next item, and is WAY- WAY- WAY too slow with the written dialogue between levels that will drive you nuts, and even has a &#34;faster button &#34; that does almost nothing to help.Don't they test things in companies anymore???All in all it's one of the better games I've played, and will play it again soon I think. Recommend it highly to others, and one reason is the graphics are usually very good. Music is good to start with and quickly gets so old you turn it off with the SAME thing over and over..", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good but could have been better", "unixReviewTime": 1403481600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2014"}
